At first glance, the literal translation of the Japanese term \"psychological safety\" suggests a state of psychological security and comfort. Therefore, on the surface, it is often misunderstood to refer to a \"lukewarm workplace where everyone is kind and no one is blamed for mistakes. For example, some people think that \"a workplace where employees are not warned for making mistakes = high psychological safety,\" or shortsightedly judge that \"employees having a hard time is evidence of low psychological safety. However, as mentioned earlier, this is not the essence of the concept. Psychological safety does not simply mean an optimistic or lenient work environment, but rather, it means an open atmosphere in which people feel comfortable saying things that are difficult to say. Behind the spread of this misconception in Japanese companies can be attributed to the atmosphere of respect for \"wa\" (harmony) and peer pressure that are unique to Japanese society. Japanese people have always been cautious about voicing their true feelings and objections, and there is a great psychological hurdle to speaking frankly in the workplace. For this reason, the concept of \"psychological safety\" is often taken shortsightedly as \"creating a calm atmosphere where everyone can avoid getting hurt,\" and the original meaning of encouraging risky and frank dialogue may not be fully understood.",

He said that the meaning may have been twisted in both the U.S. and Japan, because \"original psychological safety\" is never comfortable for the average conventional person, but can be a tough place to be with discomfort. In fact, psychological safety teams require mutual tolerance of value conflicts and even discomfort from pointing out mistakes, which can lead to more superficially stressful and \"uncomfortable\" situations. In traditional majority cultures, it is often considered good to avoid as much friction as possible in relationships and to maintain an unspoken harmony. As a result, the \"healthy conflict\" and \"frank talk\" required by the inherent psychological safety are seen as uncomfortable in a formulaic organizational culture.

          "text": "The research and literature on psychological safety has amassed abundantly over the past two decades. Edmondson's 1999 paper was a pioneer in this field, which has evolved into numerous empirical studies showing the relationship between team learning and performance. For example, the aforementioned Google internal study (2016) is one such example, with data showing the impact of psychological safety on team effectiveness. Edmondson himself continued his research and published his book** The Fearless Organization in 2018. In this book, he emphasizes through various company case studies that psychological safety is essential for innovation and growth, and offers concrete measures to foster it in organizations. A translated version of the book (commentary by Toshiro Murase and translation by Tomoko Notsu) was published in Japan and has been read by many executives and managers. In addition, a practical book unique to Japan has also appeared. For example, Ryosuke Ishii's \"How to Create Psychological Safety\" introduces methods to enhance psychological safety in the context of Japanese companies, and suggests steps to foster a culture of \"ease of talking\" and \"mutual help\" from a front-line perspective. In addition, in Research on the Development of a Japanese Version of the Psychological Safety Scale (2021)** by Yoichi Ochiai and Yuji Otsuka, the need for a scale that is adapted to Eastern culture is discussed, and a measurement method that takes into account factors that inhibit speech specific to Japanese people is proposed. This is an important academic contribution to cultural adaptation of psychological safety.",

On the other hand, some point out that \"the higher the psychological safety, the better. If the tension is eliminated due to an extreme degree of familiarity, it may actually reduce productivity. What is important is to strike a balance between a sense of security and a healthy sense of tension, as Edmondson notes, \"Psychological safety and accountability can go hand in hand. In other words, the ideal culture is not one that avoids high goals and tough feedback, but one that challenges them and respects each other.",

However, in today's highly uncertain world, fostering psychological safety is inevitable if diverse human resources are to collaborate and innovate. Overcoming cultural gaps and misunderstandings and pursuing psychological safety that returns to its original meaning is a major challenge and opportunity for Japanese companies in the future.",
