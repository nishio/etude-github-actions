Dewey saw the role of the expert as \"recognizing\" the new social community created by the new interdependencies created by the new technologies. He explained that democracy needed to be constantly reinvented, and that for Dewey, democracy was not about voting, but about people collectively governing their interdependencies. Since technology is constantly changing the nature of interdependence, the expert expressed the idea that it is necessary to identify these new forms of interdependence, create new populations, and allow these populations to self-govern once they recognize themselves. As an example, he said that the global warming issue has only become recognized through global statistical analysis, and that the role of the expert is not to impose his will as an expert on the issue, but to act as a mirror reflecting the new interdependent population.",

In the latter case, if the trees are too far away from each other, they lose the ability to cross-pollinate, so a better method (bees, transportation, etc.) is needed; Plurality is this way of thinking, and I stated that the goal is not utopia.
