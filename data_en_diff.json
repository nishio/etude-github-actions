Uno argued that democracy is never about achieving one popular will, but should be a society that allows for diverse experimentation. He mentioned fandom as a form of association in our time, and said that fandom, which is often exclusive, should be created with openness. He also defined politics as the art of plurality and the art of cooperation among mutually different and equal people, and called for its restoration.

He expressed hope that simple democracy tends to become unconstrained populism and that Deliberative Democracy (Deliberative Democracy) and Democratic Experimentalism (Democratic Experimentalism) will become the driving force. In Japan today, lawsuits, rather than politics, have become an effective platform for social change. The presentation posed the following questions.",

He stated that he came across Radical Markets while feeling troubled by the current capitalist system but feeling that existing alternatives were insufficient. Noting that economics has not adequately addressed market failures and economic disparities, he mentioned the keyword \"Alone\" proposed by Glenn Weyl and said that he recognized the challenge of economics' overemphasis on personal rationality and decision-making. He introduced the idea of economics contributing to plurality through a mechanism (e.g., the TTC algorithm) and a collective decision-making mechanism that does not rely on the number of votes (boat count). In particular, he praised the Majority Judgment mechanism for its superiority in revealing the distribution of ratings for each candidate and its potential to make collective decision-making visible.",

Choice offers a variety of features, including boat-matching**, gamification with quizzes, policy comparisons (80+ topics), tracking of key KPIs, and guides on how to vote, and reported that over 1 million people, primarily teens to early 40s, are using it. He introduced the **\"poll map\" he and Nishio developed for last year's election using open source software called Polis**, explaining how this can visualize not just simple approval or disapproval, but also diverse clusters of opinion, divisions**, commonalities, and more.",

He also spoke about his own experience with a heart defect. He also warned that, based on his own experience with a heart defect, he is aware that everything is resettable and that we can easily lose our democracy. He introduced Taiwan as a place where, unlike the United States, which runs on an old operating system (250 years old), we can rethink what democracy should look like in the 21st century, and that by making the government public and providing easy access to data, Taiwan has become the most exciting constitutional democracy in the world.",

He explained that democracy needed to be constantly reinvented, and that for Dewey, democracy was not about voting, but about people collectively governing their interdependencies. Since technology is constantly changing the nature of interdependence, the expert expressed the idea that it is necessary to identify these new forms of interdependence, create new populations, and allow these populations to self-govern once they recognize themselves. As an example, he said that the global warming issue has only become recognized through global statistical analysis, and that the role of the expert is not to impose his will as an expert on the issue, but to act as a mirror reflecting the new interdependent population.",

Then, when the election for public office approaches, the approval or disapproval of each issue for each generation will be made visible. As a meta-mechanism, it is up to the individual people to decide \"how much weight to give to the opinions of the visible minors in voting.
