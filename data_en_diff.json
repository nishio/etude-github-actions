For example, when a user asks an AI about a controversial issue, the AI will respond by summarizing the mainstream views in the training data. The user may misinterpret this as \"everyone's opinion. When only one point of view is presented repeatedly in this way, it can create the illusion that it is a consensus supported by multiple independent sources. This is what the author calls \"[the] illusion of consensus. When this illusion is combined with the \"spiral of silence\" that makes it difficult for people to express minority opinions, society becomes more inclined toward a single set of values than it actually is, and [plurality] may be lost.",

According to Mouffe, the public good on which everyone can reasonably agree is a myth, and \"consensus-oriented politics\" that aims for such a good often involves the \"elimination of minorities. Rather, in a healthy democracy, it is inevitable and desirable that there be consensus on certain basic values, but that there be constant clashes of opinion on specific policies. Hence, Mouffe warns that an excessive inclination toward the \"politics of consensus\" leads people to political apathy or boredom and diminishes democratic participation. This is the position of [agonism] ([controversialism]), presented as a critique of the Habermasian model of deliberative democracy, which emphasizes the importance of institutionalizing \"[constructive disagreement]\" as opposed to the [illusion of consensus].",

          "text": "The issue of \"[surveillance capitalism]\" raised by [Shoshana Zubov] is precisely a warning that the invisible manipulation of human behavior and emotions by technology threatens democracy. She argued that Google, Facebook, and others are using accumulated personal data to predict and guide people's behavior, and that their economic principles are eroding [human autonomy] (and thus [democracy]). Zubov likens surveillance capitalism to a \"coup d'etat from above,\" criticizing it as a system in which people's preferences and emotions are manipulated without their knowledge. For example, in the [Cambridge Analytica case data to create psychological profiles and deliver political advertisements that target individual voters' anxieties and desires in an attempt to change their voting behavior. The scandal made a huge impact by showing that data and AI can be used to precisely deliver messages that appeal to people's emotions. According to Zubov, the goal of surveillance capitalism is not to directly oppress users but to \"[quietly induce them] to behave predictably,\" and in that respect it is more subtle and dangerous than [1984-style totalitarianism]. To counter this less visible form of emotional manipulation, she urges that increased literacy on the part of citizens and transparency through regulation are essential.",

Avant-garde movements such as Happening and Fluxus broke down the barriers between the viewer and the artwork, opening art to the events of everyday life. [Alain Kaprow] has organized a series of audience-participation \"[happenings]\" since the late 1950s, with the aim of \"[dismantling] the distinction between art and life. Based on this trend, aesthetic theorist [Nicolas Briault] named the participatory and interactive art that emerged in the 1990s \"[relational art] ([the aesthetics of relations]). In relational art, the work of art is not a one-way passage from the artist to the viewer, but the relationships that arise between people become the work of art. Representative artists such as Rirkrit Tiravanija, who served food to the audience at an art museum and turned the table banter itself into a work of art, and Hiroshi Sugimoto, who worked on a project to collaborate in terraced rice fields in a farming village. These are examples of the process becoming a work of art.",

          "text": "There is, however, some sharp criticism of relational art from critic [Claire Bishop]. She pointed out that the Briault theory uncritically regards relationships as \"good,\" and questioned the tendency to praise participatory art as democratic without questioning the quality of the relationships that are created. According to Bishop, \"We assume that a relationship is democratic and good only if a dialogue is established, but shouldn't we examine the quality of the relationship and the power structure that is occurring there? What kind of relationship and for whom?\" . She rather valued participatory works that are fraught with conflict and tension, and appreciated \"[agonistic relationships]\" that do not settle for easy reconciliation. This is an application of [Mouffe's] political thought ([agonism]) to art criticism, and Bishop argues that it is in political art that conflicts and disagreements are made visible and have social significance. For example, the \"Vote In/Vote Out\" project by the Spanish collective PSJM simultaneously aroused trust in and anger toward democracy, as participants voted in a mock election that was later exposed as being rigged. This was intended to create an uncomfortable experience for the participants, but also, therefore, to develop in them a critical awareness of the political system (precisely the art of \"learning from disagreement\" rather than \"comfortable consensus\"). Bishop argued that such \"[* the] violence of participatory art\" should also be noted, and that mere simulations of harmonious communities would not lead to social change.",

Beuys declared, \"[Every human being is an artist],\" and aimed to creatively transform society as a whole by using it as sculptural material. In his signature project, \"[* 7000 Oaks],\" he planted 7000 oak trees in the city of Kassel with citizen volunteers at the Documenta exhibition in 1982, adding a 1.2 meter high basalt stone pillar to each tree. This was an example of environmental art as well as an example of the urban greening movement itself presented as art through [citizen participation]. Beuys believed that \"in order to change the gigantic form of society, we must use not only pictures and sculptures, but also human social activities in general as materials,\" and was actually involved in the formation of a political organization (Green Party) and the establishment of a free school. He stated that \"true [Gesamtkunstwerk] is only possible in the context of society as a whole, and we will never reach the ideal democracy as long as no one is able to participate. These words would embody precisely the ideology that regards the democratic process as a work of art. Beuys' ideological legacy has had a profound influence on subsequent participatory and community art. In fact, \"7000 Oaks\" visualizes the way street trees grew and lined up over a period of five years, symbolizing social sculpture in which art takes time to remake the social environment.",
