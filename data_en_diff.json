If they win the competition with other men, they are rewarded with wealth, power, and honor, and they can successfully reproduce, but if they lose, they have little or nothing at hand and cannot reproduce. As I wrote in my previous article, one of the problems with the feminists' way of thinking is that they have a bias to only look at men who are in the \"upper\" positions of success, wealth, and power in society, and not men in the \"lower\" positions. This prevents them from taking into account the fact that competition exists among men, and that there are many men who live in miserable conditions because of this competition.",

It is true that there are several texts that are difficult to explain with unitarianism ([thedivinecouncil.com https://thedivinecouncil.com/Psalm_82_overview.pdf], [Desiring God https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/ the-divine-council?utm_source=chatgpt.com]). On the other hand, as the Shema (Deut. 6:4) indicates, a strong confession of faith that \"[Yahweh is One]\" is also inscribed in the Old Covenant ([Crossway https://www.crossway.org/articles/what-does-deuteronomy-64-mean/? srsltid=AfmBOoqMIi0eOOHhLTcmIc-gTfNgYYdPZYN6e6cg4DUJegKhF-E7SrW-&utm_source=chatgpt.com]). Thus, while there is ample evidence for the claim that \"early Judaism had a concept of divine plurality in the heavens,\" it is not identical to the [Trinity] theory developed by later Christianity, and is currently subject to divergent interpretations even in academic circles ([Medium https://medium.com/ interfaith-now/daniel-7-is-the-son-of-man-divine-human-or-both-27708b23d89c?utm_source=chatgpt.com], [Scholar's Crossing https:// digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=lts_fac_pubs&utm_source=chatgpt.com]).
