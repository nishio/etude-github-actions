He mentioned fandom as a form of association in our time, and said that fandom, which is often exclusive, should be created with openness. He also defined politics as the art of plurality and the art of cooperation among mutually different and equal people, and called for its restoration.

He expressed hope that simple democracy tends to become unconstrained populism and that Deliberative Democracy (Deliberative Democracy) and Democratic Experimentalism (Democratic Experimentalism) will become the driving force. In Japan today, lawsuits, rather than politics, have become an effective platform for social change. The presentation posed the following questions.",

He stated that he came across Radical Markets while feeling troubled by the current capitalist system but feeling that existing alternatives were insufficient. Noting that economics has not adequately addressed market failures and economic disparities, he mentioned the keyword \"Alone\" proposed by Glenn Weyl and said that he recognized the challenge of economics' overemphasis on personal rationality and decision-making. He introduced the idea of economics contributing to plurality through a mechanism (e.g., the TTC algorithm) and a collective decision-making mechanism that does not rely on the number of votes (boat count). In particular, he praised the Majority Judgment mechanism for its superiority in revealing the distribution of ratings for each candidate and its potential to make collective decision-making visible.",

Choice offers a variety of features, including boat-matching**, gamification with quizzes, policy comparisons (80+ topics), tracking of key KPIs, and guides on how to vote, and reported that over 1 million people, primarily teens to early 40s, are using it. He introduced the **\"poll map\" he and Nishio developed for last year's election using open source software called Polis**, explaining how this can visualize not just simple approval or disapproval, but also diverse clusters of opinion, divisions**, commonalities, and more.",

During the discussion, he argued that a clear distinction needs to be made between collective decision-making (deciding something by voting) and gathering everyone's opinions to better understand the world (gathering information for decision-makers).

This is the point where we have come to see the importance of co-creation** issues (collective choices about curriculum, school construction, policy making, etc.) as equally important. We mentioned that scarcity itself may be related to the fact that collective decisions are not being made in an ideal way. Second, the problem of co-creation is more difficult, and the difficulty of approaching an optimal solution leads us to aim for dramatic changes (improvement from 1% to 5%). He stated that such changes cannot be achieved without citizen participation because they have a significant impact on people's lives and cannot be \"sneaked through by a prince\".

Dewey saw the role of the expert as \"recognizing\" the new social communities created by the new interdependencies created by the new technologies. He explained that democracy needed to be constantly reinvented, and that for Dewey, democracy was not about voting, but about people collectively governing their interdependencies. Since technology is constantly changing the nature of interdependence, the expert expressed the idea that it is necessary to identify these new forms of interdependence, create new populations, and allow these populations to self-govern once they recognize themselves. As an example, he said that the global warming issue has only become recognized through global statistical analysis, and that the role of the expert is not to impose his will as an expert on the issue, but to act as a mirror reflecting the new interdependent population.",

At the workshop, they gave a proposal-oriented lecture on the future digital democracy driven by Japan, focusing on PLURALITY. Afterwards, it was an excellent opportunity to deepen understanding through a question-and-answer session with the participating Diet members. A summary of today's proceedings will be made available immediately after the meeting, with the aim of improving the policy-making process and reducing the administrative workload. #Takuya Hirai #PMT Study Group #audreytang #glenweyl #audreytang #glenweyl",
