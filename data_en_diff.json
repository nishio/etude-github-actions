We think about what should happen in the future. We would like to bypass the high wall of revision of the Public Offices Election Law and aim for a quick win. We can prevent people from creating multiple accounts and watering down their opinions by authenticating them with their own numbers, and we can exempt them from the [Public Offices Election Law] by making it a vote for an issue rather than a candidate, thereby opening up voting to minors. Then, when the election for public office approaches, the approval or disapproval of each issue for each generation will be made visible. As a meta-mechanism, it is up to the individual people to decide \"how much weight to give to the opinions of the visible minors in voting. This can be regarded as the participation of minors in voting, appropriately weighted by the will of the people.",

In other words, it is a meta-structure to realize political participation of minors appropriately weighted by the will of the people, leaving it to the individual will of each voting member to decide \"how much weight to give to the visible opinions of minors to be reflected in his or her own vote.",
