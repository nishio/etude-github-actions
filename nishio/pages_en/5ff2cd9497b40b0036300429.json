Context Proto and Insights
Looking back at the 2020 activities, I realized that there seems to be a relationship between [Contextual Prototyping] and the insights presented in [Textbook of Design Research], but I had never considered the relationship.

 What is a contextual prototype ([contextual prototype])?
 	→Prototype to verify if users perceive value in the story
	[Textbook of Design Research]
　　Extracting Insights
　　　What is good insight?
　　　　Read and understand: so that it is possible to involve people who do not know the context in your team
　　　　Leading to innovation
　　　　New findings

In other words, contextual proto is about the people who receive what is created, whereas insight is about the people who participate in the design process
