How to chop tasks
I gave advice without understanding the context too much (I should have done it after I understood the context properly).
　In a nutshell, let me summarize.

When we say that tasks should be separated and made smaller, should we separate them by time or by content?
　Even if separated by content, if a task depends on other tasks, the scope of modification would be extended.
　If you divide by time, you can't set a goal.

advice
　In hourly increments, verbalize what you will do in that time before you begin.
　　= Also determines goals on an hourly basis.

　Since the estimation capability is not perfect, there are naturally cases where "it took longer than expected and was not completed in time" or "it was completed earlier than expected".
　But repeating the process will gradually improve your estimating ability.
 Review the plan from time to time.
 　= You do not have to reach the goal in time
 　We'll change our plans based on that.
