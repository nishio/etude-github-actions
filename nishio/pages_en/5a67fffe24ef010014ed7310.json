Rating scale and novelty
Are areas where the rating scale is clear a red ocean?
Aren't areas with a clear evaluation scale not unexplored?
Isn't there any novelty in an area where the rating scale is clear?

rebuttal
Advancing into unreachable areas of the evaluation axis is called novelty.

refutation of a counterargument
That's just an improvement.
