 *1195513073* Programming Process
 Get up in the morning.

 I saw the "I see, I didn't know you had that kind of idea! So I coded it.
 I should have recorded the process (see http://d.hatena.ne.jp/higepon/20071108/1194495170).
 In the meantime, I wrote it in a Python interactive shell, so I'll just paste that in its entirety.
 Comments beginning with # in the middle are comments written later

 I heard many interesting stories.
 
 - Fluent interfaces and method chains are two different things.

 - FluentInterface

 - We concluded that jQuery is wonderful.
 - JavaはLL
 - All but me are erotic.
 
 What else? I'll write when I think of something else.

 <body>I'd like to record the process, so I'll send it to http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/とか調べていました. It would be nice if there was something that could record audio and post it to some video site. I'd love to have something that can record the process and even post it to some video site. </body>.
