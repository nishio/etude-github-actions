Logic Analyzer @ Micra
Redstone in Mycra, I built a logic analyzer because it is difficult to observe the ticks with the naked eye, so I thought I needed a proper measuring device first.

Use that repeaters can fix output with repeaters from the side.
A signal flows down the left side with a 1-tick delay, and we fix it all together from the right side without delay.
The one I built this time has a window of 15 squares, but I think it could go up to 31 if I put a stop switch in the middle or something. Beyond that, it would be necessary to install an undelayed repeater with an adhesive piston.
