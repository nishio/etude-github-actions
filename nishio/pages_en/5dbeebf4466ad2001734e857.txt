Notes on Day 15 of Play
	Lv. 75, World 9
		My wife progressed to lvl 75 during the weekday, and I got to the point where I could catch up on my days off.
		My wife is world 10.
			Wife: "I'm not going back for the carrots."
		Play time 6:37, calories burned 1320 kcaal, distance traveled 26.33 km.
			My wife's at 6:25, 1414, 29.93, so I'm getting less exercise for the time it's taking me.
		Ring Con 3908 times Push in
	I've learned to double jump so I can avoid enemies I don't have to fight.
		Carrot harvest in progress (World7 Swing Gate)
	Now with 10 skill slots.
		I've only put in general attack and single attack because I don't have a lot of skill slots, but I've decided to put in three attacks as well.
		I didn't include recovery, I have 20 recovery smoothies accumulated, plus 4 resurrection smoothies.

capture
	Early on, a "turn your skills red" smoothie is on the way.
		This changes all skills to red.
		　Cannot be used according to the color of the enemy.
		Which is stronger, "change color + reinforcement" or "attack in the enemy's weakest color?"
	Against blue enemies
		700 damage when attacked by a blue skill with 80 attack power: 8.75
		640 damage when attacked by green skill with 130 attack power: 4.92
		Weakness attribute attacks seem to be 70-80% stronger, though not up to 2x stronger.
	Against Red Enemies
		755 damage when attacked by red skill with 90 attack power: 8.39
		825 Damage: 10.3 when attacked in red enhanced state with a skill that changed color to red with 80 attack power.
		If not affected by color change, +23% with enhancement
	Which is more advantageous, clothes with +10 attack power or clothes with +5% of a specific color?
	World7 is a blue-centered world
		This is where the blue smoothies show up.
	Double EXP smoothie appears in World7
		4 carrots + 3 onions
		Neither carrots nor onions are available materials for purchase at this time.
			Both available at the swing gate.
				→Items doubled and it was 0 carrots and 8 onions (bad luck).
		Battle gyms treat three battles as one battle.
			Smoothie bonus will be +2427 Exp or so (W07)
			Dracostadion of W07, expected Exp 4700
				→ Smoothie bonus was +3805.
	Goma Smoothies
		Double items
		Sesame can be bought.
		Bananas are not sold.
			I kind of made a banana smoothie, but I shouldn't have consumed bananas because I could buy those.
		You can buy bananas at World8.
