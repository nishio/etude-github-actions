Bias to think a clean framework is the right one
	[All models are wrong.]
	[Problems that are not easy are complex].
	There is a framework for representing complex problems with a well-rounded appearance.
	It pays an additional cost for "[well-formed appearance]"
	So a well-rounded appearance framework is highly out of touch with reality.
	However, many people prefer a well-defined appearance.
	This [cognitive burden] is uncomfortable.
	Over [simplify] by trying to avoid discomfort
