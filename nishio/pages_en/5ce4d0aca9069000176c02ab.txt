Added explanation to Optimism in the face of uncertainty
	[(2.2.3.2) Optimism in face of uncertainty]
		>why can we only correct optimistic misunderstanding and not pessimistic misunderstanding since in both the cases you can just switch machines once you've realised that the machine you chose is not good enough.
		Not both the cases.
		"you've realised that the machine you chose is not good enough"
			You misunderstood that the machine is good.
			It is "optimistic misunderstanding".
		In "pessimistic misunderstanding"
			The machine you [** did not] choose is better than the machine you chose.
			Because you did not choose the machine, you never notice it is better.
