 >Please bring your consulting projects as raw as possible.
 >The worst thing that can happen is that they are boiled down halfway and subjected to strange restrictive conditions.
 >When they say, "Since you are paying us to do this, we will organize the requirements for you," necessary information is lost and strange restrictions are placed on the project.

 >I get case consultations, but when I mention that I'm going to charge them, they back off, and I don't know if I can do anything about it.
 >I think they're not willing to pay because they're in the groove of calling up salespeople and trying to call up consultants.
 >Our brains are for sale over here, so we have to charge when called upon.

No, there is no rule that says "you have to charge when called", just an assumption.

In exchange for the "value of one hour of consulting."
 Take 30,000 yen in cash.
 Take something else intangible.
 Refuse because you don't think they can pay you what you're worth.
Each case is a case-by-case business decision as to which of the following to choose. It is not a one-size-fits-all decision.

Of course, you may get contacts from "helpless customers" who are neither willing to pay nor able to provide another value offering, but the reason why this happens is because the seller's branding is failing.
