The question "why" is ambiguous. It could be concrete, abstract, future, or past.

Q: Why am I on the train now?
A1: Because I got on the train 5 minutes ago (past concrete facts, history)
A2: To arrive at X station in 5 minutes (future specific purpose, intent)

Q: Why do trains run?
A3: To transport humans (explanation that they are components of a larger concept)
A4: Because the motor powered by the power supply rotates (explanation based on the combination of smaller components that make up the train).

And it is used for criticism. 'Why did you do this!'

 	Why did this happen?" It is easy to misunderstand that you are being blamed and to come up with excuses, so you should ask specifically, "What happened? (in the past)" and ask specifically.
  Why do you want to do it?" This may be taken as criticism of the desire to do it, so ask specifically, "What will happen if you do it? (future)" and ask specifically.
