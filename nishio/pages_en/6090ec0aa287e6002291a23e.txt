 *1339231552*0.0 / 0.0 what would be?
 On my Mac OS X 10.7.3, it is nan, but when I tried it on Rackhub (Ubuntu), it is -nan. I wonder why the behavior is different?
 >|c|
 #include <stdio.h>
 int main(){
   printf("%f\n", 0.0 / 0.0);
 }
 ||<
 
 I have found that although the specification says that 0.0 / 0.0 should return NaN, it does not specify the sign of NaN or what to put in the mantissa part, so it is OK to return -nan.

 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
 Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
 It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
 The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
 fb:30:59:0a:fd:b2:51:ed:fb:2c:89:0c:34:72:54:07.
 Please contact your system administrator.
 Add correct host key in /Users/nishio/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
 Offending key in /Users/nishio/.ssh/known_hosts:33
 RSA host key for [langcore.rackbox.net]:50149 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
 Host key verification failed.

 This is because I deleted a server I once created on Rackhub and recreated it under the same name, which changed the fingerprint on that server and alerted me to the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack. I am being warned that I am being attacked by a man-in-the-middle. This time I understand that I created a different server with the same name, so I delete the relevant line from ~/.ssh/known_hosts and I am OK.
