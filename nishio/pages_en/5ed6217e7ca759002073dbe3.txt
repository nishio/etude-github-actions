Recoil
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ISAA_Jt9kI]
Atoms are changeable and subscribeable units

The [Regroup] I'm working on now is also characterized by "many atoms, often with multiple components depending on one atom, or components depending on multiple atoms, and I want to redraw only some of the components when the atom changes", so Recoil's approach seems to be very applicable.

The talk of wanting to [partially update] also sounds like it would be better to incorporate Recoil's results than for me to do the design myself right now.
