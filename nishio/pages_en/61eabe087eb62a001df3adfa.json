parable
In the Japanese version, I choose the word "[TATOE-BANASHI]" corresponds to parable stories. It is because the word "metaphor" is not familiar for most Japanese.

	[TATOE]: [example], [simile], [metaphor], [allegory], [parable]
	[HANASHI]: story
		BANASHI: HANASHI's [Rendaku]([sequential voicing])
