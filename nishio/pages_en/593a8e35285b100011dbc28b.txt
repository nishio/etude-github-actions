		We waste time without realizing that we have very little time to waste.
  Prioritize interruptive work and requests from others.
  Repeatedly put off because of the hassle of getting around to it (but always aware of it).
  	Excessive expectations of future self
  You want perfect results 90% of the time and only 10% of the time to get it done.

	Tend to think that there are still a few days before the deadline
 	But if the total amount of tasks is greater than the number of days remaining, there is no time to waste
  Why do we think we can afford it if we can't estimate the total amount of tasks?

	Five Task Shooting Basics p. 62
 	Manage today's one day's work in one sheet

  Estimate time for all jobs.
  Automatically calculate and always know what time you will be done for the day.

	You can't "waste time."
 	I don't think it's useless when executed.
