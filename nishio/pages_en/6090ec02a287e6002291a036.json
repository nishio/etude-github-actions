 When I went to bed with a cold and bought a lot of soft drinks and preserved SOYJOY or something like that that can be eaten without processing, I ended up living a very unfulfilling life, eating and drinking a little of that area when I got hungry.
 
 Well, now that the "eyes have come to life," let's do some things now.
 
 I seem to alternate between a mode in which I am doing something continuously and a mode in which the threads of that something are torn and I completely forget about it. In the refrigerator, there is a large onion, three cases of kimchi that expire in August, and eggs that expire on May 10. Oh, I cracked the eggs yesterday and decided they were edible from the rise in the whites, so I'll eat them again today.
 
 I think kimchi will be thrown away, as expected. Even if I could eat it, it would be very sour. There is one unopened one...
 
 I had some chicken ramen that had an expiration date of September 30, so I consumed it. I bought a new pack.
 
 Uh, yesterday's eggs were fine, but today's two eggs were not. Not that it's a definite no-no, but they are too dry and the whites are very sticky. I think I'd better not try this.

 <body>A kimchi with an expiration date in August is better than eggs with an expiration date of May 10...? </body>
