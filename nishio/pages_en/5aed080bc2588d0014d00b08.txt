When you have a lot to do, you are eagerness-driven.
 Relationship between the amount of "Will/Can/Must" and "Should" in "[Can], [Should], [Want]" [Will/Can/Must].
 I titled the article "Inflation to be Done" with the aim of asking what would happen if the amount of "to be done" were inflated.
  Maybe the naming is too bad.
  After three years, I changed it to "want-to-do-driven when there's so much to do".
 If you make it "the relationship between the amount of work that needs to be done and the amount of work one wants to do," it could be misinterpreted as something like "[thinking about adult developmental disabilities]."

When what needs to be done is too narrow
 Do what you can
 It's easy to see what needs to be done but hasn't been done.
 Learn it and increase the range of "[can do]".

When there is a wide range of things to do
 I know I should do it, but not all of it.
 Hard to know which one to start with.
 [Too many options] and you're in trouble -> [demotivation].

That's where [wanting to do] becomes important."
 [Motivation] by making choices based on [intrinsic motivation
 The concept of making choices based on "want to" from "should" was discussed in the [Motivation Creation Method

 What people want to do is different for each person, so what they will be able to do is also different for each person.
 As an organization, it is preferable to have a variety of people because they can cover a wider range of "to do" #Diversity

 Driven by what you want to do, even when there is nothing in particular to do.
 In other words, it's more common that way, and only under limited circumstances is it driven by what needs to be done.
