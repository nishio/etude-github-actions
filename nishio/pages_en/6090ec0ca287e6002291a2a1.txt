 *1364301488*About sutra as a means of learning programming
 One blogger wrote something to the effect that "sutra copying doesn't work. I read it carefully and found out that he was referring to "copying 10,000 lines of code that you know will work as work, without thinking about it. I laughed and said, "Of course not," and then I asked myself, "Is that how the world sees sutra?" I felt uneasy.
 
 Sutra is an action to create a model within oneself, and its advantage over other more efficient methods is that it can be used without a model within oneself. No one can suddenly "think and write on their own" with absolutely no knowledge. First of all, we need to bring the knowledge that will be the material for thinking into our brains, and that is what sutra is for.
 
 The following three things are important in the process of sutra copying.
 - 1: Experiment with as small a code as possible to learn quickly and check results immediately.
 - 2: Write down what you wonder, what you think, what you notice. Why do I write it down this way? Could it possibly be an error if I rewrite X as Y? Well, that thing I wondered about earlier is supposed to be paired with the part I am copying now, etc., etc. This thought is a stepping stone to the next learning experience.
 - 3: Do not copy word for word the same, but omit if you feel you don't need to. Inevitably, you will think about what is important and what is not.

 I reprinted what I Tweeted this afternoon when I saw "<a href='http://anond.hatelabo.jp/20130322031333'>Come here a minute if you can't program</a>".

 I agree with your comment to the effect that the term "sutra" is a source of misunderstanding, so please let me know if you come up with a better name for it.

 Postscript:
 
 The other day, in response to the assertion that "sutra copying is futile," I asserted that "sutra copying is beneficial." However, I did not mean to say that "sutra copying is always the best. In fact, it is the worst study method. However, when other methods of study are not available, or when reading explanations, specifications, or articles does not help you get the idea, the last resort that can be used is the sutra.

 <body>I, too, am uncomfortable with the term sutra. <BR>What about the term repeat-coding, with the meaning of follow-up experimentation or imitation? </body>

 <body>I used to copy Bemaga when I was in elementary school. I was desperate to debug because mistakes would be made somewhere and it would be sad if what I had typed in didn't work. I didn't even know English words. I think it was a good first step. It was also fun to realize in English class that this is what that instruction meant when I became a junior high school student. </body>

 <body>>I'm all for comments to the effect that the word "sutra" is a source of misunderstanding, so if you can think of something better to call it, please let me know. <br><br>It seems to be close in meaning to Code Kata. </body>

 <body>"Maybe that's how the world sees scripture?" <BR>Most people are like that. Those who can transcribe while thinking about the meaning of the code are rare, and at that point, they are already well educated and talented. The majority of the rest are too lazy to think and just transcribe as they are told. It's not worth talking about. </body>
