Liquefaction of knowledge
The [opposing concept] of [crystallization] of knowledge.

>The thinking space of a professional is a mixture of "segmented information" and "implicit information. This state is called the "Knowledge Nebula," and professionals are required to "reconstruct" and use this information to fit the context in which they are placed when necessary, based on their experience. Knowledge liquefaction" is the process of extracting this segmented information and other data that exists externally and storing it in the Knowledge Nebula Crystallizer in a form that is as closely aligned with actual business operations as possible. The Knowledge Nebula Crystallizer is a system that reconstructs and presents the accumulated information fragments from a certain perspective ([Contextual Keyword]). The process of "[crystallization of knowledge]" is the process in which "[new knowledge that fits the current context]" is created in the thinking space of the professional through interaction with the presented information and its information.
