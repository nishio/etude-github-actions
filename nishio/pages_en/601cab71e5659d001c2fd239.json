2021-04-14

2021-04-13
	I was trying to write too seriously and hadn't updated it at all since 2021-02-05, so I decided to make it more of a chore.
	　When I release it, I'll Tweet about it and paste it in.
	Fixed a bug in yesterday's addition of the [Make Proposal Support Mode] that caused all other modes to also be in the make proposal mode.

2021-04-12
	Added [Support mode for proposals to be made

2021-04-02 to 2021-04-09

　 [Writing support mode]
　 [Reflection support mode]
　The writing support mode will be developed into a tutorial to be used in conjunction with the "Regroup tool to organize your head" in the future!

2021-03-26 to 2021-04-02
	The ability to generate Regroup maps from chat logs has been added.

2021-03-19 - 2021-03-26
	The log formatting dialog for Scrapbox has been improved so that Scrapbox pages can be created with a single click.
　　However, due to the API design on the Scrapbox side, it is not possible to put logs into that page
　　I put it in the clipboard so you can paste it in after Scrapbox opens.

2021-03-12 to 2021-03-19
	Robot icons are now cute!
	Past conversations can now be listed as a list of updated dates and first statements

 Keywords containing verbs are now extracted.
 	>Example: What kind of "want to do" is this "want to do"?
　The appearance of the question has changed.
　　>before: what kind of X is that X?
　　>after: what kind of "X" is that "X"?
　Explicitly inform users when keywords are missing or when keywords are growing at a slow rate.
　Service was suspended on the night of 2/4 by mistake. It has been corrected.
