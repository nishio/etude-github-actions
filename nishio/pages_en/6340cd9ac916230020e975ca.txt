	>Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wanted to conquer Nanyue State in the southern region. As a first step, he sent envoys to the neighboring provinces of Nanyue and Yalu.
 > The kings of 滇国 and Yarrow Province asked the envoys from the Han Dynasty about their respective countries.
 > "Which is greater, Han or our country?"
 > Of course, the Han Dynasty was more powerful. Both the 滇王 and 夜郎王 were too ignorant about the situation outside the country.
 > From here, people who are naive and overbearing came to be called "yoro-jidai" (yoro-, oneself as big as one's self). --- [A dictionary of 4-character idioms] [What is yoro-jidai - Cotobank https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A4%9C%E9%83%8E%E8%87%AA%E5%A4%A7-649952]
