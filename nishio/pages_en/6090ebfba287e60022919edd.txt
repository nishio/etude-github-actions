 I woke up cold around 4:00 am. My back was out of the covers.

 Cat-bi~n is cute, isn't it?
 
 *1225441002*TeX in MacOSX
 How many years has it been since I last put it on my Windows machine? When I searched for TeX, I found a lot of things like teTeX. In my mind, TeX means pLaTeX, but I wonder if I need to change my perception.
 
 Anyway, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeTeX'>teTeX - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a> says that teTeX is old and no longer maintained, so I went through it, I decided to try the new TeX Live. port search texlive and there it is. I'll just have to do this.

 It looks like they are building ghostscript now. Well, it's going to take a while, so I guess I should start writing the manuscript first. It's due today. (Oh!

 I'd like to join the drinking party. I wonder what they talk about?

 You'll know that when you participate, and you won't know until you participate (^_^).
 
 *1225452818*It's a pain in the ass to set up a TeX environment.
 I opened the style template for Word with something like that in iWork.

 I wish you the best of luck!
 
 *1225465107* done.
 Phew, it was over with 5 minutes left.
 I had to go to an even number of pages, but if I had been careless, I would have ended up with three pages, but I had to work hard to get it down to two pages. At any rate, this is a relief.

 <body>If you were missing the last few lines, why didn't you just expand it from being 3 pages to 4? </body>
