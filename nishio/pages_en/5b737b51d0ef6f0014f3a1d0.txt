familial resemblance
The concept that whether or not an element is a member of a certain group may not be determined by common characteristics.
In [Philosophical Investigations], [Ludwig Wittgenstein] pointed out that concepts such as "language," "games," and "numbers" have no features that are common to all their objects, but are only loosely connected as a whole by features that are partially common, which he named familial similarity.

Is the target in the figure similar to Group 1 or Group 2?
Orientals tend to choose Group 1 and Westerners Group 2.

Let's delve into the two ways of thinking.

Four attributes.
 Attribute 1: Target petals are round, Group 1 has 3/4 petals round, Group 2 has 1/4 petals round
 Attribute 2: Target flower center is a single circle, 3/4 of Group 1 is a single circle, 1/4 of Group 2 is a single circle
 Attribute 3: Target has leaves on it, Group 1 has leaves on 3/4, Group 2 has leaves on 1/4
 Attribute 4: Target stems are straight, Group 1 has 0/4 stems straight, Group 2 has 4/4 stems straight

In this situation, would you put the target in group 1 or group 2?
 Oriental type: the idea that since three of the four attributes indicate that "Group 1 is closer", it should be placed in Group 1.
 Western: Attributes 1-3 do not clearly separate the groups. The idea is that Attribute 4 is the criterion that separates these two groups, and if you follow that criterion, you should be placed in Group 2.

Western types can easily explain to others the reasons for their decisions. It can be made into a clear proposition: "If the stem is straight, it is group 2." On the other hand, it is vulnerable to noise. In this example, attribute 4 could cleanly separate the two groups, but if noise is introduced and even attribute 4 cannot separate the two groups, the Western type will fall into the trap of thinking, "There is no clear criterion to distinguish between the two groups. It is also vulnerable to cases where some of the attributes are unobservable. If attribute 4 happens to be unobservable, the decision is reversed.

The oriental type is resistant to noise and to unobservables. However, the reason for the decision cannot be simply explained. If we dare to explain, the rule would be: "If the petals are round, one vote for group 1; if the center of the flower is a single circle, one vote for group 1; if it has leaves, one vote for group 1; if the stem is straight, two votes for group 2. The rule is: "The group with the highest total number of votes shall be the group with the highest number of votes.

The relationship between if statements, [decision trees] and [logistic regression].

In [Logistic Regression for Easterners and Decision Trees for Westerners], we confirmed that logistic regression is an Eastern type of decision making and decision trees are a Western type of decision making.
