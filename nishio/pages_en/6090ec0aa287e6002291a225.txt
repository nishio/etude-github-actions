 *1335718079* Is "outsourcing all work" beneficial?
 I think it is easy for people who are good at Go or Shogi to understand, but there are some cases where people can immediately answer "that move is bad" at a glance, but cannot answer "why is it bad? but when they are asked "Why is it bad?
 
 The same question was asked by id:Yoshiori at the Nico Nico Super Conference: "If you throw all the work from your company to crowdsourcing, wouldn't you earn money without working?" I decided on the spot that it was a bad idea, but could not immediately answer why. The answer was more subtle, something like, "You can't put the company's code out there."
 
 After two days of sleep, I finally found the correct solution.
 
 
 What does it mean to be able to throw all the work coming from the company to crowdsourcing? It means that you are not doing anything that "only you can do" or "only an employee can do. It means that you are only entrusted with tasks that "anyone can do," even a stranger on the other side of the ocean can do. As long as I know crowdsourcing and the company doesn't know about it, I think it's possible to make money without working, taking advantage of the knowledge gap. But that situation ends when the company learns about crowdsourcing. That situation is not a win, in fact, it's pretty close to a loss. In the endgame of Othello, you might say, "I didn't get the corners, but I got all the edges! My color is three times more than yours! It's like saying, "I didn't get the corner, but I got all the edges!
 
 There is a flip side to the line that says you should aggressively outsource what you can outsource. If you can outsource everything, you have nothing to compete with your competitors who can pay the same amount of money. What cannot be outsourced is the source of competitiveness. What cannot be outsourced is the most important ability you need to develop. Outsourcing everything" is not the goal to aim for. It is clearly a bad move to aim for that situation.

 (Also, I've never experienced this, so this is completely baseless and subjective, but "just throwing work that comes down from above to subcontractors" doesn't sound like fun...)
