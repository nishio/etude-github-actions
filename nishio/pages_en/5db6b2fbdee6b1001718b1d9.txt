Get OCR results from Gyazo Pro via API
code:python
 import requests
 
 GYAZO_API_TOKEN = "..."
 GYAZO_API_ROOT = "https://api.gyazo.com/api"
 GYAZO_IMAGE_ID = "bf881c1e44d798978431f9a2af02acdb"
 
 res = requests.get(
     f"{GYAZO_API_ROOT}/images/{GYAZO_IMAGE_ID}", headers={
         "Authorization": f"Bearer {GYAZO_API_TOKEN}"
     }
 )
 print(res.json()["ocr"]["description"])

PyPI has [python-gyazo], but it is not implemented to get a single image by specifying its ID, and "ocr" in the response is ignored, so you have to do a lot of work to use it for this purpose, and as mentioned above, you can achieve your goal in a few lines, so there was no need to use it.
