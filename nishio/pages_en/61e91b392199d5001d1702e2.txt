(4.4.1.1) Open book and closed book
The book "[Technique to Read Difficult Books]" introduces the difference between [open book]s and [closed book]s. An open book is a book that the author does not say his opinion. The author hopes for the readers to think themselves. A closed book is a book that the author has his opinion. The author hopes for the readers to understand and agree with his opinion.

While many books in the world are closed books, in philosophy books, there are many open books. In this book "Intellitech," I have some opinion, such as the [cycle of learning] and its three phases: [information gathering], [modeling], and [verification]. I'm going to build the concept in you, so it is a closed books on this point. However, one of my conclusions is "[The optimal way to boost creativity depends on your situation, so you need to build it by yourself.]" I do not show a particular technique as the optimal. The book is open for [concrete] techniques.

Footnote:

	The concept "open" comes from "The Open Works" by [Umberto Eco], but I did not read it.
