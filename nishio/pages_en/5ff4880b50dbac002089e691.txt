[Algorithm Practical Skills Test]
	I got the last problem consideration for the practical algorithm exam right, so now if I can stop spending so much time debugging the problem in front of me, I'll be able to get to the advanced level...
	This time, I spent 2 extra hours on H and J compared to the others, and only solved H. The next goal is to get both of these correct and leave 2 hours. What should I do?

Componentization of buggy code
　DFS in a loop
　Graphing from String
　Search not to graph from string
