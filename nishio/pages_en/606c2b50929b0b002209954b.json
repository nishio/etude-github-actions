Template chatbotization
I noticed when I was thinking about [✅making an empathic writing mode] that the "fill in the template" method encourages verbalization by having humans think about filling in the template, so the composition is similar to a chatbot encouraging verbalization by asking questions.

If the chatbot can handle one "fill in the template" type method by creating an empathy writing mode, the mechanism can be horizontally expanded to other template-based methods.

Things that I can think of now that could be developed.
　Chatbotized [KPT] and look-back bot
