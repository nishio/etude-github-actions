 The top one is a self-designed, self-directed movie.
 The bottom line is fishing and gibberish.

 *1192442331*how to write.succ
 The most casual but important point is that the user display in the upper right corner changes to an iframe. The part that changes depending on the user can be separated so that other parts can be cached and shared with other users. It should be comfortable to display a tree of subjects with many comments....
 
 *1192446880* It's 8:00, so business is closed.
 Arrive at work at 11am + 9 hours = 8pm.
 
 So I wrote them down on a piece of paper. I hadn't noticed.
 
 I had a spontaneous desire to write it down and acted accordingly, but this <a href="http://blog.zabou.org/?eid=320016">ZABOU BLOG | Ivy Lee's "$25,000 Idea"</a>.
 
 I was going to eat dinner and then write, thinking that if it was 8:00 I would be hungry, but for some reason my stomach was infinitely upset. Bloating. Why?
 
 *1192448091* MML Notation in Hatena
 
 It would be nice to support the stoton notation of text music sacra.

 Found amachang villa instead
 
 I finally found it. I had looked too far away. It was closer than I imagined. Diagonally from McDonald's.
 
 *1192454513* Character code
 
 What "@" was to Python and Java. The "P" was in Python but not in Java, and the "J" was in Java but not in Python. J" was in Java but not in Python, although it is likely that any of the P's will correspond to any of the J's...
 I didn't think there were so many character codes just for Japanese. I didn't realize there were so many character codes in Japanese alone.

 PATCH sent.
 I haven't made any progress on the manuscript, but let's just say it was fulfilling.
 
 *1192462713* I almost wrote a song about java-ja.
 
 <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20071010/1192018196">songs of java-ja</a>
 
 Â Saanbaar Khan has six notes while Jabaja has three. I thought I could stretch it twice as long, but it was too long and it didn't work.
 So I mixed only the second half of the Sambalcan into the javaja. It turned out to be jambaljan. Oh heartless.
 If the main character's name is like that, it would change the lyrics of the rest of the song!
 
 For example,
 
 Our souls are burning too → Our project is burning.
 
 Even if the night of sorrow continues, you wait for the morning without losing → Even if the night without the last train continues, you wait for the morning without losing
 
 Ahhh, if I make it with lyrics like this, I'll be bullied every time I go to java-ja next time!

 Wow. That's smart. It's true that rotating wind turbines inevitably occupy a large, round space, but this one is compact enough to be installed in an urban building or the like. As long as it's not too noisy.
