(5.2.3.1-3) Illustration and documentation
When the [group organization] is over, the next step is "[illustration](A)." Spread the piles again and try to make the spatial composition. Then add enclosures or arrows to the arrangement as necessary. Jiro Kawakita called the result "an illustration."

In the last step "[documentation](B)," we make sentences based on this illustration. 

As a subspecies of the documentation(B), Jiro Kawakita also proposed "[oral presentation](B')." In either case, the process creates a one-dimensional sequence of words. I omitted it from title for brevity.
