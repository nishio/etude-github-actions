Scrapbox付箋
[pRegroup2020]

done
	If you post a Scrapbox URL, it should become a Scrapbox sticky, just like if you post a Gyazo URL in text sticky mode, it becomes an image sticky.

I want to be able to distinguish between "with text", "without text but with 2-hop link", and "without text" links.

If you do "2-hop expansion" from the detail screen, you should get stickies linked to the surrounding area.
	I want [link between stickies].
