　Thoughts.
　　If you think about each bit individually, you can figure out the number of 1's in the interval by the remainder of the power of 2, right?
　Official Explanation
　　It is a logarithmic order solution
　　Constant order if you notice the following
　　[$ f(A, B) = f(0, A - 1) \oplus f(0, B)]
　　　[any interval is the difference between intervals from 0].
　　[$ 2n \oplus (2n+1) = 1]
　　　[XOR of an even number and the next odd number is 1].
