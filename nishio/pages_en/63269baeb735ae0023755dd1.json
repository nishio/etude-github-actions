>First, let's define "[work]" as "doing work" and check the definition of "[work]".
> Work is "to receive [monetary compensation] for lawful [labor]. (This is the definition that Dr. Yasuo Suwa, former chairman of the Central Labor Relations Commission, gives every year in his lectures in the Startup Design Course at Tokyo Tech.)
> Therefore, being a bank transfer scam operator (=illegal labor) or volunteering (not receiving monetary compensation) is not a job.
> In other words, to summarize, "not working" can be broadly classified into the following three categories.
> 1. receive monetary compensation for illegal labor
> 2. receive no monetary compensation for legitimate labor
> 3. not doing any of the above work
> I am quite exceptional about 3. Even if I'm playing Splatoon all day or watching TV, I'm still in 2.
> I've got it all sorted out so far. Now it's time to get down to business.
> In my arrangement.
> "Working = a way of life with relative emphasis on [personal happiness]."
> "Not working = a way of life that is relatively conducive to the evolution of society."
