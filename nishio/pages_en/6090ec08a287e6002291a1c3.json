 The machine learning system seems to be a little different from the artificial intelligence system. The videos can be played at 1.5x speed (sound is not so good), but it is not easy to understand where the quiz is like the artificial intelligence one, so I can't just solve the questions while skipping over the lessons. Maybe I just don't know how to do it.
 
 PS, okay, okay, it looks like the quiz is where the yellow marker is on the seek bar of the video. So the Artificial Intelligence system is a bit older and the video is split by the quiz, but this one has the quiz embedded in the video.
 
 In addition to the class videos, there is also a "review questions" section, in which students are given 10 minutes to answer about 5 questions and submit them to be graded on the spot.

 It seems that some questions do not have a time limit. Oh, maybe I was wrong earlier about the "10 minute time limit". I think I misunderstood when I saw that it said the interval between retries was 10 minutes.
