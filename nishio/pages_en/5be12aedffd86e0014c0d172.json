Carcinogenicity of Rice
The story goes that rice from paddy fields contains higher concentrations of arsenic than other grains due to the large amount of water used by the paddy fields, which is a carcinogen.

>The Livsmedelsverket (Swedish National Food Agency) advises children not to eat rice and rice products more than four times a week and adults not to eat them daily. It also advises against giving rice cakes to children under 6 years of age.
