Mental model of behaving in a way that does not offend.

I'm trying to teach them, but they are not aware that type guarding is "to protect against potential runtime errors" in the first place. The mental model is something like, "I'm going to typeguard [because] TS will get mad at me." Maybe that's fine at first, but it's a moot point because runtime errors are only gained through experience with JS.

If you only write TypeScript, you can probably get by with "because TS will get mad at me" to some extent, but I wonder how you can learn when to do that, or how to write smartly without needing a type guard in the first place by applying processing earlier....
