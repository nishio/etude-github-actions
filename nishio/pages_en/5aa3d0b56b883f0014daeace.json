	[Is it good to be focused?] I was thinking about that, and my wife told me.

 It is said that Hiroshi Mori can write 6,000 words in an hour, but this is only the equivalent of writing 1,000 words in 10 minutes, and in reality he cannot sustain it for an hour. p.63
  The same misconception applies to [pomodoro]: people talk about working intensively for 25 minutes, the author himself says it is better if you can do it 8 times a day, and then they say "8 hours a day, so you should be able to do 16 pomodoros".
