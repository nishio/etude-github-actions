 I know it's hard to see, but there is a fountain coming out of a manhole next to a pylon. I was so careless because I had an umbrella, but it was completely pointless. The road was partially under five centimeters of water.

 *1217943705* Gentlemen, I love thunder.
 Gentlemen, I like thunder.
 Gentlemen, I like thunder.
 Gentlemen, I love thunder.
 
 
 I like distant thunder.
 I like Raiden.
 I like Spring Thunder.
 I like lightning.
 I like the bolt from the wall.
 
 
 But I hate the rain.
 I hate you.
 
 
 I hate downpours.
 I hate evenings.
 I hate May rain.
 I hate the fall rain.
 I hate icy rain.
 
 
 I hate every kind of heavy rain that gets my socks wet.

 In other words, I was in a groove while eating lunch and watching the lightning in the safe zone, but on the way home my socks got soaking wet and I lost motivation. I'm not motivated because my shoes are soaking wet - (in the voice of Anpanman).

 The bridge was full of them. More paramedics were looking at the bottom of the bridge. Was someone swept away? Was anyone swept away by the rain?
