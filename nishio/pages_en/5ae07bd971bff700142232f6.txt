The parable of the fox and the bear
	The fox was injured and stuck.
 The bear gave him leftovers.
 A man sees this and interprets it as God did not abandon the fox.
 I lie down myself and wait for God to give me food.
 Nothing happens.
 Man returns to town swearing to God that he loves the fox more than himself.
 There's a poor hungry kid in the street.
 Man swears to God, "Why don't you do something about this poor child?
 God's line.
 	I created you as a human being.
  You could have been a bear, but you keep trying to be a fox.
