Drawing on past dichotomies
[https://gyazo.com/9cc8f1e7e9539bf7c51e74e4746902e5]
　1: In the past, A and B thought they were in conflict
　2: A or B is not a point, but a set of concrete examples
　3: As time goes by, new examples emerge.
　4:
　 People associate new cases with close cases.
　 The boundaries of A and B are not clear.
　 　This process spreads unconsciously.
　5: A new C appears.
　　C is A or B?
　　　This is [a sterile argument].
　　Conflict was slowly lost as the boundaries widened.
　　The idea that the dichotomy of the past continues is itself an assumption that is not grounded in reality.

concrete example
　Pass-by-Value and Pass-by-Reference: [Pass-by-Reference Value].
　Compile and Interpreter Methods
　Flow vs. stock: [flow/stock is a false dichotomy].
　Job-based vs. membership-based: [Membership-based or job-based employment is a false dichotomy].
　Work and Life: [Work as Life].

relevance
　[false dichotomy].
　[trade-off between two attributes].
　　A story about how destroying the assumption that two attributes are a trade-off can lead to new ideas.
