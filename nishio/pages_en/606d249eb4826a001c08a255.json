Definition of Harassment
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's definition of harassment is titled "Definition of Harassment," but it is not a definition of harassment itself, but individual definitions such as power harassment.
	>Power harassment in the workplace is defined as (1) language or behavior in the workplace that is based on a superior relationship, (2) that goes beyond what is necessary and reasonable in the course of work, and (3) that harms the worker's working environment, and that satisfies all three elements from (1) to (3).

Osaka Medical College defines it this way
	>Speech or actions toward others that, regardless of the person's intentions, offend, injure the dignity of, disadvantage, or threaten the other person.
