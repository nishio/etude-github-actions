	Thoughts.
	　[$ 2 b_i = a_i
	　[$ X = b_k \times (2p + 1)]
　　As for ordinary common multiples, multiplying all of them is a common multiple, but as for antiprime multiples, you're going to have trouble with even numbers included.
　　Think about specific b values
　　3 5 → 15
　　3 9 → 9
　　If all the numbers are odd, normal common multiples
　　2 3
　　 Odd multiples of 3 and odd multiples of 2
　　 I don't think so.
　　Conclusion.
　　　0 if b contains an even number
　　　If not included, find the ordinary least common multiple x, and then the odd multiples of x.
　　　　Divide M by x to obtain
　　I looked at the sample and it looks good.
　Official Explanation
　 This is an error.
　 　0 if >b contains an even number
　　2 6 -> There is a 6 which is an odd multiple of 2 and an odd multiple of 6
