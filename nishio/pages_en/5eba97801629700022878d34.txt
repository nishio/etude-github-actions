Container metaphor and road metaphor
There is a [container metaphor] and a [road metaphor

People who drag mental models such as Evernote before Scrapbox tend to use tags as "containers".
　For example, put the tag "book" on all your reading notes and go around.
　This recognizes the tag as "the container in which the pages about the book are placed.

But when I listen to shokai and others, I often hear the expressions "link," "connect," and "trace.
	[People remember places not by their latitude and longitude, but by the route they take.]
		It's [a metaphor for] the road.
		[link is way].
 So is the metaphor of the "door to anywhere."
 	The road is not connected and cannot be traced.
 	→ Put the door out and put in a string that looks close to where you want to go.
 	→Suggests some of the places you can actually go.
 	→Choose the right one and the road will lead you to it.

I hear a lot of "we want to make the search better."
 That's like saying "I want a faster horse" at a time when automobiles were being created.
 I don't have a problem with sticking with a horse just because it's what you're used to.

Lines like "Scrapbox is expensive to learn."
　There's not a huge amount of notation that needs to be explicitly learned or anything like that.
　I think the real hurdle is the "change in mental models" that isn't explicit.
 And the more the mental model changes, the more useful Scrapbox is.
 　However, in the management of nota, "usable without change" is chosen over "usable without mental model change".
 　As a result, it is difficult to see the need for change because the mental model can remain unchanged and still be used accordingly.
