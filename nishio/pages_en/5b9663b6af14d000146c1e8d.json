Bracketing suggestions have the distinction that, unlike general editing suggestions, they do not detract from the original text. In the type of editing that erases and rewrites part of a sentence, the erased part often contains something that the author implicitly values, and the phenomenon of "no, no, no, such a revision is not possible" often occurs.

I'm sure I can quantify how often I reject edits by editors during the editing process of "The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production" if I try hard enough, since I have the entire history in git, but subjectively it seems that I reject quite often. Maybe it's just that the ones I reject leave a lasting impression.

I think the "read the text properly, suggest corrections, and have them largely rejected" process is quite burdensome, so it is difficult to turn it around with a passing volunteer. qiita had a feature for edit requests, but it appears that it was not utilized as much as open source development.

In the case of software, there is an easy-to-understand axis of "it is buggy" and "I fixed the bug. On the other hand, "This feature I want is missing" and "That's why I made it" are more likely to lead to rejection, saying "No, you shouldn't include such a feature. The text is even more unclear on the axis.
