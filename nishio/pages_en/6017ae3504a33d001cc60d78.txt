Using Scrapbox and Kanban together
Tried a little 1/26
　Some good things happened.
　I quit 2/1

[1/26 https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10223957456700809]
	I wonder if there should be a Kanban look like GitHub Project, where all the one line headings on the cards are links to Scrapbox.
	Scrapbox is good for keeping "things that may or may not be done" in the air, and when you try to fix something, you can see "Oh, I see, it's related to this", which is very good.
	On the other hand, I sometimes find myself in a state of mind similar to "I want to clean up my messy room, but I don't know where to start," and in the metaphor of a messy room, I need a "tidy desk" in one corner.
	I linked from Scrapbox to Github's Kanban, but there's no back link, so I converted it to an issue and posted the unreadable Scrapbox URL, which was barren.
	>Kohei Okubo: It's not enough to make a page that says, "A tidy desk.
		That desk is going to be a mess...
  Unsure how to keep Scrapbox uncluttered.
  >"New tidy desk"
  There is a way to make a page every day.
  > That sounds good, but now the related links are going to get messy.
  >I'm not sure what the definition of "messy" and "uncluttered" is.
  >I guess I should just make it up and turn it off.
  Indeed -> jumble of related links
  >What do you want to do with Kanban? Progress management?
  >Will you put the scrapbox link and title on your trello?
  I think they want to stop things from getting distracted by associations.
  >Some associations are necessary, he said.

 >Takahisa Endo, Scrapbox, you keep writing on the same page, and once a week you duplicate it and erase it completely.
		Duplicate and delete? What do you mean?
  > I write anyway on a page called TODAY, and every Sunday I copy the whole page with "Duplicate this page", replace the title line with the week number 2020'52, and delete the extra information.
 	>And the TODAY page from which it was copied is initialized. I use the same TODAY page all the time because it has a link to a hot page that I want to use immediately!
  I see. I imagine cleaning my desk once a week.

	The sign features, we are forced to retire what has been done and face what is left at the end of the w

		If I hadn't tried this Kanban, I think I would have unknowingly avoided writing an explanation and started implementing a feedback button.
		Whether to write a commentary now or to reschedule is debatable, but at least it is characterized by the fact that "what I was going to do" stays there and doesn't go away on its own unless you "explicitly change it".
		After chatting, we decided to explicitly change it and implement some of the feedback buttons first
			[I'd like to talk and sort out whether to write an explanation at this point or implement the new feature first].
