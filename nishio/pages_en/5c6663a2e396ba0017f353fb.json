Hannah Arendt.
>[Labor] is the active force that sustains life, the work of the body that is closely linked to metabolism and consumption, and leaves nothing behind as a product.
> 
> [Work] is the active force that leaves behind as an outcome an object of relative durability, as indicated by the fact that work is both a verb meaning to work and a noun meaning a piece of work.
> 
> [Activity] is speech and action between people, an active force that absolutely requires others, a response to the fact that humans are plural.
