log-bilinear model
	log-bilinear language model
 	The probability of occurrence of the following words under a given context c is
	 [$ P(w|c) = \frac{\exp (\phi(w)\cdot c)}{\sum_{w'\in V} \exp (\phi(w)\cdot c)} ]
  The language model is that [$ \phi] is an embedding function for the appropriate word
  In short, take [inner product] and [soft max].
			In A. Mnih and G. Hinton (2007), a little more advanced than mere inner product

	Similarly, softmaxing after taking the inner product is [note the inner product] (2015).
