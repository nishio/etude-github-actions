Mechanical generation of quotes
2018-10-03
I was talking about the mechanical generation of [quotes], and I felt uncomfortable when he introduced the automatic generation of poems and catchphrases ([AICO]) as related research.

I know a little bit about what that is.

First of all I am interested in the intelligence of machines.
	Research on giving intelligence to machines included the [Mind Pixel Project].
 There, [common knowledge] that is true, such as "humans are mammals," was collected.
	But people did not feel [value] for this kind of set of knowledge. [Common sense is worthless.]
 Since the customer in the early stages of machine knowledge creation is a human being, it is important to know what the customer values.
	The "quotes" are samples of short sentences that people found valuable.
		Quotes are pieces of thought that humans have deemed useful.
 	In many cases, they have even gone through the [test of time].

While "man is a mammal" is true, "[time is money]" is not.
	When the metaphor is turned directly into "time is as precious as gold," it is still only a subjective assertion.
	I believe that knowledge creation starts with subjective, personal [analogies] and [metaphors], which are then organized and crystallized after the fact.
 	[words being spoken].

[People do not value information that is obviously true.]
[Knowledge creation is subjective.]
