Rare CID problem
The [CID problem] was solved by [CMap regeneration], but the phenomenon of rare characters being replaced by CIDs still occurs.
If this is the case as it is, a frequent word could be `cid`.

 Manual entry for each book

I tried to display one book, but it was surprisingly small, so I entered the correct answer by hand.
code:python
 data = data.replace("(cid:12101)", ":")
 data = data.replace("(cid:31)", "fi")
 data = data.replace("(cid:7743)", "捗")
 data = data.replace("(cid:29)", "fl")
 data = data.replace("(cid:30)", "ff")
 data = data.replace("(cid:13949)", "兎")
 data = data.replace("(cid:7656)", "翰")
 data = data.replace("(cid:7767)", "灘")
 data = data.replace("(cid:12255)", "●")
 data = re.sub(r"\(cid:12[678]\d\d\)", "", data)
I wonder if the correspondence between codes and letters is the same for other publishers. Probably not.
The last line is squashed together because there are many CID embeds that are not shown below. This is surely a watermark to identify who leaked the PDF when it was leaked.
