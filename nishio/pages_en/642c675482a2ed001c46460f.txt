People who thought they were being made fun of.
The person who feels [stupid] tries hard to show that he is not stupid by saying difficult things, but because he is talking [pieced together] about [concepts] that he does not understand well, the content is incoherent, and as a result, he effectively shows that he is stupid. Hilarious.

How can I avoid being in the opposite position?
