Do we need unframed text?
	[pRegroup2020]
	Based on [illustration is cooperation of pictures and words].
		Now I can draw with a pen.
		What if I wanted to put in a word?
			Write with a pen
			Make a sticky note
	Is the text just sticky notes?
		Sticky notes have restrictions.
			Frame.
			Fixed size
		Isn't it hard to cooperate with pictures?
	Proposed method of realization 1
		The "Text Without Borders" button
		A text input field appears just like a sticky note.
		Variable-length, fixed-font-size text boxes are being added more and more on new lines.
		Drag and place in figure afterwards
		Concern: Might want to adjust font size later
			The mechanism of being able to specify font size only in advance is not good.
				[Edit after the fact]
	Proposed method of realization 2
		press the button
		Boxes can be drawn
		Drawing a box brings focus to the text area, where you type
		As with stickies, "Font size auto-adjusts to fit box."
		Concern: Might be time-consuming to switch back and forth between text and handwritten input
	concern
		If you have the means to output cleanly, you try to output cleanly.
		Trying to convert text in a figure to text is not productive.

	It is more convenient to have a string in text format to hit the search.
	Maybe voice input instead of keyboard would be better.
		Lack of functionality to delete or edit when strange conversions occur.
	It might be better if the text is placed on sticky notes around the diagram and pointed out with a leader line.
