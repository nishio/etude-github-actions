This is giving off a vibe."

Oh, I love this kind of thing.

This is the kind of idea you draw, don't you?

I said, "What's this?"
Wife: "In Andy Warhol."

That's where you draw the apple, so it makes sense.

The cat's gone.

I said, "Great."
Wife: "Looks like it could be used on the cover of Poe's Black Cat or something."

Wife: "Good cat drawings, I wonder if he draws them himself."
I said, "It's a realistic style, so maybe the AI can refer to photos or something."

Wife: "Not him."

You're right, he did make some of those pieces.

You're creating an atmosphere, but I wish you'd try a little harder to draw it.

Wife: "Your face is too copious."

I said, "You seem to like this kind of composition, although the cat has been squashed."

You seem to like this kind of distorted space motif.

Repeat tiling, if you draw the cat a little more properly, it looks like it.
