Adaptation in English
 [Empirical estimates of adaptation: the chance of two noriegas is closer to p/2 than p^2 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3115/990820.990847]
	The title noriega is the name of a politician. Kind of like "Kennedy."
	When the probability of a word appearing is p, we tend to think that the probability of it appearing twice is p^2
	But in reality, once a word appears, it appears with high frequency.
	How high a frequency is this?
	Surprisingly, the conditional probability [$ Pr(k\ge2|k\ge1)] of appearing k+1 times with k occurrences is,
		Not depending on the probability of one occurrence [$ Pr(k\ge1)].
		[$ Pr(k\ge1) = DF_1/D]
		[$ Pr(k\ge2|k\ge1) = (DF_2/D)/Pr(k\ge1) = DF_2/DF_1]

　Comparing words with the same probability of occurrence, Kennedy, for example, shows a higher concentration of occurrence than except.

		In [Development of an extraction system for keywords in unexplored text information], the distribution of substrings in the paper is compared with the distribution of strings chosen by humans as keywords, showing that the keyword distribution is as probability-independent as the story here
		Based on what we're talking about here, it seems like that kind of distribution for word distribution alone, and for keywords, it's on the upper end of the scale. I would like to compare the distribution of words with the distribution of keywords.
		Conversely, for any given string, DF2/ DF is an indicator of "keywordiness" independent of its frequency of occurrence
