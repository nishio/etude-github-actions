Anti-Burnham experiment
	Fortune-telling statements are often written in such a way that they apply to everyone.
		See [Barnum effect] [Barnum effect - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E3%83%A0%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C]
	Conduct the following experiment on divination, which divides humans into several types and describes what kind of personality a person of that type has
		Example: Animal Fortune Telling (I did it this way)
	You don't identify your type as per the divination procedure and then read the description of it.
	Read the description of all types as if it were a description of you.
	During the process, I'll note down statements that I think "this doesn't apply to me".
	The result is a "list of personality descriptions that you think don't apply to you".
	This list of "I don't think I am this way" is more useful than the fortune-telling itself

digression
	I did this to predict which type I would be and then did the divination process, but it didn't come true.
