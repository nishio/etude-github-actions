There is more than one type of customer.
The "Let's think about [customers]" viewpoint has become widely known, and more and more people are considering it, but there are often cases where people are satisfied with considering only one type of customer.

For example, consider a system like UberEats, where you order food online and it is delivered to your home.

This is not enough consideration. Cooking" and "delivery" do not just spring up on their own.

In reality, there is a delivery person who provides the labor of "delivery". If the delivery person does not want to use this system, the system will not work.

So, looking at this diagram, the part where the "dish" comes out has not been drawn yet. Let's draw it.

In other words, the "order taker" is not the only customer; there are also "delivery person" and "cook" customers. If each of these three types of customers does not feel that using this system is worthwhile, the system will not work well.
In other words, when designing such a system, one must consider what value will be provided to each of the three types of customers.

Let's consider another example, a "go there to see interesting content" type of service like Pixiv or YouTube.
With this service, users will see interesting content!" is not enough consideration

That content will not spring up on its own. There must be a creator, such as a YouTuber or painter, who creates it. Then, what value do these creators receive from this system?

For example, if we were to pay a creator, where would the money come from? You would have to consider the following questions. Would viewers be willing to pay?

When that seems impossible, it may be possible to make it this way by developing another customer, for example, an advertiser.

This made sense, as there were no more "resources that we don't know where they come from".
The unknowns are how much value advertisers will find in this system and how much content will be generated with the money they pay....

summary
　Don't think of customers as one type of customer.
　There are no resources that spring up on their own. When you add where the resources come from, you finally have a picture that makes sense.
　Then, the system must make sure that every customer in that figure feels valued, or the system will not work well.

　[I think it's too much of an abstraction to ask people to understand the duality of the market, because people who can only see one type of customer don't even recognize the system as a market.
　You can think of it as a [stakeholder] analysis. It's just a matter of whether you call them customers or stakeholders.
　The employees of a company are also stakeholders who provide labor to the company system and receive compensation, so it is necessary to increase [employee satisfaction] in the same way as [customer satisfaction]. It is only because they are bound by a strong contract of employment that many people think of them as an integral part of the system without separating them from the system.
