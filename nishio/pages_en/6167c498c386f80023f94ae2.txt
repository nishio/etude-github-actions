Transfer HTTPS to HTTP on Heroku
I wanted to receive a webhook and do a little processing.
	I don't want to set up an HTTPS server on server X that handles that process because it's a pain in the ass to manage certificates.
	Received by Heroku and forwarded to server X via HTTP.
	(After I did it, I thought that Lambda might have been better)

code:python
 from flask import Flask, request
 import requests
 app = Flask(__name__)
 
 
 def create_app():
     return app
 
 
 @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
 def root():
     if request.is_json:
         print(request.json)
         requests.post("http://...../", json=request.json)
     return "OK"
