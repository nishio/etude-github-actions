And, at present, data on what kind of pictures I, the human, release and what kind of pictures I do not release is being accumulated at a rate of about 1,500 pictures per day. When I have accumulated enough data, I will conduct an experiment to see if humans can distinguish between the pictures selected by me, a human, and those selected by an AI, mixing them half and half. If not, I can say that the system I have built is in fact me.

If you put them in last visited order, the ones that other people have seen will go up, so the footprints of others will become a temporary order in the museum.

　Let's make it a system that says, "If a week goes by without a human reviewing it, the AI will make a decision and release it."
　Then when I die, the AI will automatically continue its creative work.

Seed Fixed Thompson's wife gave him a good reputation.
　So the fact that the seeding was random was increasing the cognitive burden.
　If so, img2img could be just as good, I can't wait to see it happen.
