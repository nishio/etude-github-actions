Determine who to persuade
Persuasion is costly. Therefore, if it is not done after identifying the target to be persuaded, it will be a waste of cost.

It is not appropriate behavior to say, "I'm persuaded because I've been rebutted," or "I'm familiar with you, so I'll persuade you."

A bit of a concretization of [don't persuade people who don't need to be persuaded].
