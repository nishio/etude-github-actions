prev [Weekly journal 2023-03-11 to 2023-03-21].
	You have 10 days? Isn't that too long? Why?
 	3/11 was Saturday, whereas this time it is Saturday + Monday paid holiday + Tuesday, so 3 days longer.
　What did you do last week?
　　Keichobot with summary function using ChatGPT.
　　　Ability to summarize chat logs at appropriate times and suggest next actions
   I feel it's worth it, but the ChatGPT API is so heavy that it causes timeouts in Heroku and fails about 60% of the time.
   Normal Keichobot also works with special commands.
　　Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector improvements
　　　Conversation continuity function
  　　At the time of release, it was a question and answer.
  　　If you do it simply, you fail to weight the "context of the conversation" and the "references" and you quickly forget the context of the conversation.
  　　I've managed to get it to work, but I don't know how to properly address it.
　　　Round-table discussion function
  　　When I published the index data I created from Scrapbox, a number of people published the same data, so I wrote a code that considered them as virtual personalities and asked a single question to multiple personalities.
  　　You can summon many people with different backgrounds to brainstorm alone.
