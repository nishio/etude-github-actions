Whether or not to connect the islands
The mismatch between "[It is useful to think about what connects the gaps]" and "[It is not necessary for the whole story to be a connected story]" was resolved.

In other words, when the goal is to create [a text to communicate to others].
　Need to break content into reasonable amounts and establish the order in which content is to be read
　This need to "separate content into reasonable amounts" reduces the need to "connect everything into one".
　　Just insert "I'm going to change the subject a little bit" at the end.


On the other hand, if you are writing for your own understanding
　relevance
 　[Writing for my own understanding].
　 [There are three types of figures.]
For example, if you put together sentences that you have spit out in fragments on a single topic and they are divided into two groups
 I have a "feeling of being one thing", but "what has already been written out" is "not one thing", so there must be "something that has not yet been written out, something that connects between the two".
 This is [the effect of noticing the existence of a blank space, which encourages verbalization].
