Make what you want to make.
>[hkawai3 https://twitter.com/hkawai3/status/1459003360749633540]: I am sure there are many people who think, "I want to make something great and be recognized by the world. If they say, "So let's make something that the world wants," their batting average may exceed 50%. ... On the other hand, there is also the policy of "making what I want to make.
	>[hkawai3 https://twitter.com/hkawai3/status/1459003362846806017]: If you make what you want to make, your batting average will probably be considerably lower, maybe 10% or 20%. If you make something that you don't feel the need for, it's not much of a stretch to make it well. And if you don't make it, someone else will.
	>[hkawai3 https://twitter.com/hkawai3/status/1459003364700684290]: then I would still want to support "people who make what they want to make". That may be a subtle result even if it is successfully completed. No, in my experience, most of the time it will. ...That's what a 10% batting average means. That's why it's okay. I know that.
	>[hkawai3 https://twitter.com/hkawai3/status/1459003367070437381]: if your batting average isn't high, just try again and again. That's all there is to it. ...Of course you can compromise a lot to increase your batting average and still fail (because it's not 100%), but are you convinced then? I am much more satisfied when I do what I want and it doesn't work out.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1459012531356266501]: Some people have a strong tendency to fear failure, and they make more and more [compromises] to increase their [batting average]. As a result, they cannot keep their own [motivation], and what they get from success becomes "[ordinary]". In the long run, you are headed for failure, but you are too short-sighted and focused on [avoiding failure] to see the big picture > [compromise to increase batting average].

>I have talked to and helped many business owners, and more often than not, they only do what they want to do in the end. Those who want to take care of people only take care of people, and those who want to make money only make money.

	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1459317958514143232]: why, what do you want to end up doing? And do you really want to do that? I try to ask them that. There's nothing more stupid than to do a job where the goals don't match.
	>I think there are a lot of people who can't be honest about it, and end up giving a fake explanation to the outside world. When I listen to them, I can tell that they are lying.
		[externally decorated motivation].
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1459318536174649346]: for example, it's a really common case where I hear the company's vision and the current state of the business and it's pretty inconsistent. I can tell right off the bat, so I ask, "Isn't that crazy?" I often hear things like, "Actually, the investors are looking forward to this, so we had no choice. I can still trust people who are honest about their situation, and there are ways to work with them.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1459319221775597574]: It is rare that all the stakeholders have the same interests, and some funds have their own reasons for doing so, so it is important to make the story as consistent as possible. It is important to match the story to the extent that it is not unreasonable. This is for everyone's benefit.
	>The most troublesome type is the one that tries to go through with contradictions, which is hard to do.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1459320097068126211]: it's a messed up situation where you're holding with A with people over there, but for internal use you're explaining with B and what you really want to do is C. Even if ABC is a lie, it doesn't rub together. The costs simply pile up. And yet, none of the commitments are halfway through the process, so there are no results. When the results don't come in, they start explaining D and E in different places. It's a vicious cycle.
		[contradictory motivation].
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1459320962915078148]: There are as many motivations as there are people, so it is inevitable that these will be contradictory. But if we repeat the all sides without facing this, the cost will build up and distort the overwork, burn rate, and many other things.
	>Conscious organization of motivation is important to minimize this waste as much as possible.
