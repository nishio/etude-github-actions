impressions
　I mechanically took 10 labels out of 100 labels, which was not good.
　　I was labeling conjunctions, etc. so that I could do spatial arrangement without having to go back to the original text, and when I selected it mechanically, "not only" was chosen.
　I would have liked to have done the same as the fireworks daily report, first dividing it by clumps of meaning and then doing a spatial arrangement of the clumps.
　The resulting net seems to be more closely related to the one in [Exploratory Net Study Group Kozaneba1], but there is still insufficient data to determine if this is an effect of the pickups.
　In Kozaneba1's method, each label is first placed close together in time proximity, from which structure is found, clumps are formed, and then the positional relationships between the clumps are determined.
　In Kozaneba2's method, the rough location of the clump is determined first.
　The latter seems to make more sense to me.

Importance of fieldwork
It's not just a job of taking action and putting measures in place.
Interviewing is an important part of our work.
More time, effort, and money should be allocated.
Take the initiative in conducting fieldwork
Provide an environment where subordinates can do the same.
