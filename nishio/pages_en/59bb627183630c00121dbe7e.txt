Diseases to be classified hierarchically
	In [organizing] physical objects, [hierarchical] categorization tends to occur
 	Because there is [an inclusion relation] in space, as in "what I put in the second drawer of the sleeve desk" is "what I put in the sleeve desk."
  By the constraint of having a single "[location]" because physical objects cannot be easily duplicated.
 There is no constraint to have a [single location] because information can be easily replicated
 Nevertheless, they try to use the metaphor of physical organization to create a hierarchical classification
 Maybe it's because they haven't had the opportunity to learn non-hierarchical organization.
 Isn't the only time you learned to organize in the first place, like a toolbox in kindergarten or putting things away in a school bag?
 What are some examples of non-hierarchical organization?
