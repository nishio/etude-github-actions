　Again, nine days long.
　What did you do?
　　in order of reminder
　　　[ChatGPT for middle and high school students].
　　　[pScrapboxAutoTrans2023-03-25]
　　Was the 21st a holiday?
　　So you spent the rest of the business day preparing for the study session and spoke on the 24th.
　　　[Story study session about connecting my Scrapbox to ChatGPT].
　　　So, he wrote, "In the long run, people will start searching for groupware from LLM."
　　　So [ChatGPT plugin] was released on the same day.

　　　So we decided that there was no time to rest on weekends, so we proceeded with the development.
　　　　You don't take time off because it's Saturday or Sunday [work-as-life], you have to take responsibility for your own actions that you think are optimal.
　　　　If not taking a leave of absence makes you sick, you can take a paid leave of absence at that time, and if you run out of pay, you can take a leave of absence.
　The connection between input and output, a lot of people don't seem to get it.
　　Is it even difficult to explain it in a way that you can understand?
　　Maybe it will be easier to understand over time.
　　Many people seem to be interpreting it as "altruistic behavior," but I'm not sure if that's the right interpretation.
　　　[I think the stronger course of action is [tsunami epiphany].
　　　Throwing out cash appears to be a spirit of sacrifice because we don't share the perception that [cash is weak capital].
　　　Isn't it [long-term investment, not altruism] that converts weak capital into stronger capital in the future?

　That said, you should finish reading "[Shrugging Atlas]" because I'm not sure you should use it beneficially as a concept if you haven't finished reading it.
　　[Useful as a concept].
