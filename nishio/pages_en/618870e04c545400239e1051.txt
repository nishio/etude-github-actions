>[toriyamayusuke https://twitter.com/toriyamayusuke/status/1457215214676365317?s=21]: There is a recurring battle between the "katakana pronunciation is fine, so be confident" school and the "no, katakana pronunciation is not acceptable" school. In reality, however, it can be said for many languages that "katakana pronunciation has its good points and bad points, and the distinction between the two can only be understood after proper study".
>tinouye: I would think that at least "katakana pronunciation is fine" would be a quicker start to speaking, so I would think it would be better to start with katakana pronunciation anyway, as we will learn the problems later.
