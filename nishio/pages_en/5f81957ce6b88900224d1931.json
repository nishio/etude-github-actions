　[Palindrome].
　Thoughts.
　　Select the first string
　　Limited number of strings that can come at the end.
　　Search in order of decreasing total cost and end when found.
　　After seeing the first and the last?
　　　Depends on which is shorter.
　　　Add on the short side
　　　What if the length is the same?
　　　　That's a palindrome formation.
　　　Palindromes may be formed even if they are different lengths.
　　　　Example a, ba
　　　　Need a low-cost determination of "is the palindrome established?"
　　　　　The part left over when the longer one is cut at the length of the shorter one is the palindrome.
　　Sign of a trap
　　　When you have a palindrome with a cost of 10^9 and a cost of 1 "parts that will not become a palindrome no matter how many combinations, but will continue to have palindromic possibilities", I feel like I would try the latter 10^9 times.
　　　Is there such a pattern?
　　　How about abc, a, cbcb, bcbc or something?
　　　　not serving its purpose
　　　I can't think of anything, so I'm going to assume it's not there, implement it, and then reflect on it when the TLE gets mad at me.
　Official Explanation
　　Only retain the parts that are not palindromes."
　　　I see, so once you get to the already existing pattern, it's a thousand days away, so you don't have to explore beyond that.
　　Graph possible transitions, with "blank" or "remainder is palindrome" as the goal [shortest path problem].
　　[Shortest path problem for state transition diagrams].
