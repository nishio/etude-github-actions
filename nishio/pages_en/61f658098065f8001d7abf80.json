Allow a little negligence.
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Allow a little negligence.
[Blame is like a bolt of lightning, hitting the highest point].

Allow for some negligence.
lxxxiii 

Such carelessness is often the greatest recommendation of talent. Jealousy makes exclusions, and is most poisonous when it is most courteous. It counts perfection in the absence of fault as failure, and condemns it in everything because it is perfect in everything. It becomes an argus, turning to imperfection as its only solace. Blame is like a bolt of lightning, striking at the highest point. Homer nods from time to time, and by feigning to valor or intelligence, not prudence, but some neglect, he tries to soften the malice, or at least prevent it from bursting with its own venom. Thus you leave your cloak over the horns of envy to save your own immortal parts.
