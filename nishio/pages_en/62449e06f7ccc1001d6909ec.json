Blacksmith Stello's second forge.
If a second copy of the blacksmith is included in the deck, there can be a case of conflict in the hand and a case of drawing the blacksmith on the draw. This disadvantage becomes smaller the more cards in the deck.
Q: Suppose the initial deck and the blacksmith are all silver coins. How many decks would the average amount of gold be better to buy a blacksmith than silver coins?

Answer: 17 pieces.

remarks
　In the case of an unobstructed blacksmith stero, this is another disadvantage to spending one turn on a blacksmith purchase because you've already started buying victory points.
　Does it work when diluted by curses or other junking attacks? Not really. Because being diluted strengthens the "benefit of buying silver coins" and weakens the "benefit of drawing 3 cards at the forge".

　7 gold, etc., the choice is "gold coins or blacksmiths", so gold coins are better in this situation, and blacksmiths will be better than gold coins much later.

What if I want to increase the "probability of getting 5 gold?"
　5 gold rate is higher to buy a blacksmith with the 14th piece.
　If you have a 5-cost village and want to do a pull-out combo, for example, this pattern is for you.
