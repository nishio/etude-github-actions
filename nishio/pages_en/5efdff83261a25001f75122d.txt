Local variables in Python are faster than global variables
Accessing local variables in raw Python is faster than accessing global variables
　It's a well-known story for those who use Python for competitive programming.
　Only useful in situations where a single variable is accessed 10 million times and where a difference of a few hundred milliseconds can make the difference between pass and fail.

code:python
 def main():
   j = 0
   for i in range(10_000_000):
     j = i
   return j
 
 print(main())
224msec
code:python
 j = 0
 for i in range(10_000_000):
   j = i
 print(j)
573 ms
