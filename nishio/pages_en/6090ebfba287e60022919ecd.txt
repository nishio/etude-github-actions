 *1223977906*"Ho!"
 To relieve myself, I bought a ginger tea. Of course, I also bought a set of tubes of grated ginger. I also discovered that GABA chocolate bitter exists, so I bought some.
 
 
 I wonder what else GABA is found in other than chocolate.

 GABA is produced in the brain by an enzymatic reaction that removes the carboxyl group from the α-position of glutamic acid. It is also known that GABA does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so even if GABA is ingested from outside the body, it is not used as a neurotransmitter as it is.

 Hmmm...taking GABA with GABA chocolate is just a comforting thought.

 It is known to be found in large amounts in kelp, cheese, and green tea, as well as in relatively high amounts in shiitake mushrooms, tomatoes, and seafood.

 Green tea is good green tea. It has theanine, too.

 >>
 Theanine (L-Theanine) is a derivative of glutamic acid, an amino acid found in large amounts in tea.
 (Abbreviation)
 Theanine has been shown to have a variety of effects in clinical trials.
 
 Theanine intake has been shown to produce alpha waves, an indicator of relaxation, 30-40 minutes after ingestion; 50 mg of theanine has been shown to relax individuals with low anxiety tendencies, and 200 mg of theanine has been shown to relax individuals with high anxiety tendencies (Kobayashi et al. 1998).
 
 The same effect on anti-stress has also been confirmed. When stress was applied to people in a Kraepelin-type mental arithmetic task, and the effects of stress on heart rate, salivary immunoglobulin A, and subjective feelings of stress were examined, it was found that theanine intake suppressed stress (Kimura et al . , 2006). , 2006).
 
 With regard to sleep, theanine intake has been reported to improve sleep quality. In addition to a decrease in mid-onset awakenings, a questionnaire to the subjects showed improvements in feeling refreshed upon awakening, sleeping soundly, and recovering from fatigue (Ozeki et al. 2004)
 <<
 
 I didn't know it had sleep-improving effects. Hmmm, green tea also contains caffeine, so I'm not sure I would drink it before bed. It also doesn't seem to be the amount of caffeine that I would consume with green tea.
 
 As for "ho-ho-ho," it would be best to strongly believe that "drinking green tea relaxes me," lol.

 I've been told it's taking too long to access the data store. It usually works fine, and it seems that sometimes this kind of error occurs when multiple people are playing at the same time. if they reload with F5, they can continue without problems. I don't know how to solve this problem.
 
 *1223989330*[GAE]How to use Django's templatetags with Google App Engine
 For those who don't know what you can do with templates, here is a one-line explanation: {{ hoge|my_filter }} allows you to call your own function called my_filter with hoge as an argument! (though you can do a lot of other things too)
 
 Without a custom filter, for example, if you want to create an img tag for a card image from a card number (integer) and display it, the question is whether to implement the logic to obtain the URL of the card image from the integer in the template engine using the template tag, which is not an appropriate language, or whether to create the URL or img tag in the controller part, which is the MVC part, and then pass the string to the template engine. The question is whether to create the URL or img tag in the controller part and then pass the string to the template engine. This as_img can be implemented as a function that takes an integer card number and returns an img tag. The separation is cleaner.
 
 I didn't know how to use this with the Google App Engine, so I put it on hold.
 <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/msg/fb44c28de3e712eb'>Custom filters for django templates - Google App Engine | Google Groups</a>
 The correct answer was written in the
 In other words, if app.yaml is placed in gae/ and the hierarchical structure is gae/saichugen/main/view.py, place template tags in gae/saichugen/templatetags and add "saichugen" to INSTALLED_APPS in gae/saichugen/settings.py and add "saichugen" to INSTALLED_APPS in gae/saichugen/settings.py.

 What if I'm tired and sleepy but can't sleep? Do I buy milk and make hot milk?

 <body>I drink powdered commercial green tea ground on a millstone every day, and it works quite well. <BR><BR>It is very easy because there are no tea leaves and you don't have to wash the teapot. <br><br>By the way, I drink a teaspoon of tea instead of a cup with a few earpicks. <br><br>I highly recommend it because it makes it impossible to concentrate on anything other than the task at hand. <br>However, it is a double-edged sword: a tremendous sense of anxiety and 12 hours of sleep the next day. </body>

 <body>When I was drinking mocha for a while, I used to get anxiety followed by hand tremors. <br>Green tea is so diuretic that no matter how much I drink, it is excreted in the toilet and the symptoms stop with the anxiety, which is convenient because I don't overdope. </body>
