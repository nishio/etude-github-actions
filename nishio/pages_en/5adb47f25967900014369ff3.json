MMORPG Parable
MMORPG's relationship with the organization's management, born out of discussions in the virtual Nishio Lab.

	西尾
  There have been more comments about wanting to join the virtual Nishio Lab than expected, but I have always insisted that 30 people is the limit for close communication, and I am very torn about whether to accept the addition.
  I am still thinking that we should limit the number of participants to 30.
  Future Plans
   Create a new Facebook group with the same framework as this lab and call it "Lab 2
   This lab will be designated as "Lab 1" from now on, and those who have already agreed to the NDA at this time will be added to Lab 2.
   If there were not enough applications for 2, we can absorb them into 1.

  I thought it was like a [MMORPG] mackerel division and annexation due to population decline.

  He said that the number of people must be within a certain range for an MMORPG to have the proper feel for play.

  The amount of land and monster spawn was the upper resource limit - so.... The [tragedy of common land] is caused by [population density].
  After that, the problem of the amount of monster spawn was alleviated in the form of dungeons that were generated exclusively for the party when they selected a quest, like in MonHun, PSO, or WoW.
  On the other hand, if the population density goes down, there will be no more people in towns, trade will not be possible, vacant lots will increase, dungeons will become unmanageable with too many monsters, and the game will be jammed. So, we annex servers and raise the population density.
