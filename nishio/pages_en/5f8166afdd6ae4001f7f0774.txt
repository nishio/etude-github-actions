Deletable set with inequality condition
requirement
　We want to enumerate from the deletable set [$ \{x\} ] those satisfying the condition [$ x \ge x_0] expressed by the inequality sign
　For example, with [sorted array], [binary search] can find boundaries that satisfy the inequality condition in logarithmic order.
　　But deleting from the array takes a linear order.
　Deletion is fast [Linked list], but random access is not possible, so bisection search is not possible.

(key to) solution
　Use [phoenix tree].
　The value range is 0/1, representing the absence or presence of a value
　We can compute the sum s for the range below x0 in logarithmic order, and then bisect the points where the sum is s+1 in logarithmic order

[Inequality condition] in [Deletable set].
