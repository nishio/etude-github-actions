 **1244543674* One piece of artwork per person, limited to one piece per person, will be distributed free of charge.
 First, to briefly summarize the argument, "If the value of art consists of a 'guarantee of authenticity' by autograph, a 'guarantee of uniqueness' by edition number, and a 'guarantee of history' by recording the date of production, etc., can a business card with a signature, edition number, and date of production be called art? Can you call it art?" That's what I mean. Just to be sure.

 I was thinking about the design of my personal business card, and I was thinking, "I think I need a picture of my face on the card so I can remember it later," or "I think it would be good to make a mind map around my face picture like <a href="http://blog.shibu.jp/">Mr. Shibukawa</a>," etc. I was thinking, "This is not so different from making CG works," "This is an image that only I can make, at least in terms of license," "It is essential to print a lot of my works on silkscreen and a lot of works on matte paper for business cards," and so on. I started to think, "There is no essential difference between printing a lot of artwork by silkscreen and printing a lot of artwork on matte paper for business cards.
 
 In essence, it is a business card, but it has the title "What I did" and the date of creation "2009-06-08" with a space for the edition number. This is an experiment to see if it would be art if I put my signature and the edition number on it.
 
 
 Well, I don't want to disappoint you with excessive expectations, so I'll just say that they are not something that you would enjoy displaying. It is just a business card. 30 yen per card. Also, some of the images are dirty due to lack of consideration for DPI. Well, I have printed 300 copies of this ver.1, so I will make ver.2 when I run out.

 PS: I ran out of power when I put in the 20-part edition number (early
 I guess I'll just put it in when requested...

 <body>The surface of the iron will naturally oxidize, so the iron will be heavier on its own. </body>

 <body>If it's not a vacuum, iron, which has a smaller volume, is heavier</body>.

 <body>Buoyancy and oxidation may be on the side of the iron, but just a splash of water is a huge turnaround! </body>

 <body>The newspaper is heavy because it's hard to hold. At least give me a lanyard.

 <body>But it's probably the iron that catches you off guard and gives you a bad back...about the size of a 1.5L plastic bottle and 10 kilos...</body>.
