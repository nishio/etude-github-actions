first-mover advantage
 The stronger the [WTA]-like situation, the stronger the influence of first-mover advantage.
 The advantage depends on the imitator's cost of imitation and the predecessor's cost of research.
 If easily imitated, the imitator has an advantage
 	Predecessors will no longer bear the cost of research
  So we grant monopoly rights through patents.
 When imitation and research costs are comparable
  It does not particularly serve as a barrier to entry.
  A set of monopoly and public disclosure through patents contributes to lowering the cost of imitation.
 A situation where advantage is even more advantageous.
 	network effect
  Imitation alone does not produce the utility of network effects.
  	Example: If a competitor launches a service with the exact same functionality as Twitter after Twitter becomes widely used, no one will move to the competitor's side.
  Some kind of differentiation can cause people to move.
  	For example, it used to be possible to speak freely, but now that the rules have become stricter, it has become uncomfortable.
   As we saw in [Why SNSs rise and fall], the flourishing of SNSs themselves leads to a decline in their utility.
