knowledge sharing
With "[knowledge sharing], all members have the same knowledge."
If indexical knowledge is shared, "Mr. A is knowledgeable about this matter," there is no need to share the substance of the knowledge in advance, because it can be inquired when it becomes necessary.

Especially as the [expertise] of members increases, it becomes impractical to share [expertise], so a knowledge-sharing organizational structure is necessary.
