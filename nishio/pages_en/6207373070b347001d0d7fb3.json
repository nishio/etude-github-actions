Try not to be a hater.

You don't have to ask to be hated: you don't have to ask right away to be hated. There are many people who hate us on their own without knowing why or how. Their malice outweighs our desire to please them. Their malice is more inclined to harm others than their foolishness to benefit themselves. Some do not get along with everyone, for they either create or experience constant mental vexation. Hatred, once it takes root, is as difficult to eradicate as a bad reputation. The wise are feared, the wicked are abhorred, the arrogant are despised, the foolish are reviled, and the eccentric are shunned. Know, therefore, that you must show respect to be respected, and respect to be respected.
