Scrapbox is a BETTER chat
Scrapbox is an improvement on Wiki as an origin, but it may be more appropriate to see it as an improvement on chat as a value perceived by the average user.

　If you want to include more than just documents, we recommend Scrapbox
　　I also value learning,
　　We help each other,
　　Expect spontaneous movement from the individual or...
　　 I think it would be better to change from communication (Chat) with Scrapbox in such cases.

　I also use [Slack].
　　But I get the impression that Scrapbox conveys the temperature of the discussion better.
　　There are like three points of contention, and assumptions, context, and complicated things can't be conveyed in slack[/scrapbox-drinkup/shokai.icon].
