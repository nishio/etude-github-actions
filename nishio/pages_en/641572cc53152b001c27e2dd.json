	I went to bed and woke up.
	I'm aware that my mental health is out of whack.
	 After observing how and why they are strange, I realized that this is very similar to their mental state after the Great East Japan Earthquake (2011).
	 In other words, they are panicking because they are unable to adapt to a rapidly changing world.
	 　Or more accurately, "The world has changed in ways I've never known, and I'm terrified of what might happen."
	 　At the time, a nuclear power plant was having an accident, and there was talk of Tokyo being contaminated by radioactive materials.

	 In the meantime, we'll just have to live our lives quietly and indifferently until things settle down.

	 	I saw him as an iron man (he has a will of steel and can use [meditation] as a gun to get back to normalcy quickly if necessary) who almost never, if not never, disturbs his mental tone.

	 	 It's only observable because it's disclosed, not usually visible.

	There's a cycle of "mental health goes wrong, sleep gets cut off, goes even crazier," so I need to get a good night's sleep.

	Added "ChatGPT" (7 days) to Twitter mute keywords.
	　This should quiet the timeline!
	　Log out of Twitter, it'll be a lot quieter! [/villagepump/takker.icon]
	Examples of mental health conditions:.

  > Any tool must be learned how to use, otherwise it cannot be used well and will not create value.
		I didn't have to use the word "suck at it."
		I don't usually talk this way.

  Strong words on social networking sites get strong words back.
  　piss in the wind
　After the earthquake, there were engineers who got excited about using their engineering skills for the benefit of society! I think it's really great that there were engineers who got excited and said, "I'm going to use my engineering skills for the good of society!

  	About this.
　　I was heartbroken and incapable of any activity.
　　Surprisingly low [stress tolerance
　　　Is that not surprising?
　　　He's got a low stress tolerance, and he's working the way he's working now as a result of his stress-aversive behavior.
　I wonder if there was a page that said something like, "You shouldn't connect with an unspecified number of people in the world when you're mentally weak."
　　We don't share context with an unspecified number of people in the world.
　　So there is an additional cost to communication.
　　When the mind is tired, this cost payment is heavy.
　　If you get tired and act messy, and then it gets boosted by unexpected interpretations, you start a bad loop, where your mind gets tired again and it costs you to explain yourself.
　　So we have to leave before it gets worse.
　　Could AI with guaranteed acceptance for tired people be in demand? [/villagepump/basic.icon].
　　　(Not necessary for those who already have such a place)
	When the world changes so violently, "[what's the point of doing this?" I get a feeling like.
	　We don't know at this point if it makes sense.
	　[Connecting The Dots]
　　You just have to do what gets you excited at the time.
　Until now, conversations with Keichobot have been independent of each session.
　　I had put that log on Scrapbox.
　　This is a pile of "my answers to your questions" data!
　　It could be easily extracted with a regular expression.
　　I'm sure ChatGPT would be better at answering on my behalf if I gave it a little ingenuity.

 	I'm doing a psych test on GPT3, interesting.
　I want Scrapbox to have a "vector search by articles written in the last 24 hours and sorted in order of similarity" top page.

　Is it suddenly cold tomorrow? Even though it's a Pikmin Bloom community day!
　Due to an operational error, I cut out the amylase question page from the amylase question page (...).
　 I was even more panicked and did Undo, which made it worse.
