Having friends.

It is the second being. Every friend is good and wise to it. Every man is what he wishes others to be. To make others think well of you, you must win their hearts and their tongues. There is no magic like a turnaround; the way to obtain friendly feelings is to do friendly deeds. The best of us depend on others. We must live either among friends or among enemies. Find someone every day who is friendly, if not a friend. After trial and error, some of them will become intimate.
