Example of premature similarity code commonality
 Paths are now removed from a group when a portion of the grouped path is selected and dragged.
	 This is intentional.
		[Select and move a portion of a grouped path.]

	If all the child elements of a group are lasso selected, it is assumed that the group is selected
		This too is intentional.

	When you drag one thing in neither lasso nor pen mode, it is moved
		This too is intentional.

	When a child element of a group with only one child element is dragged and moved, it leaves the group, leaving an empty group
		This is unintentional.

	An unintended side-effect of "Move to exit group" is that when I try to adjust the position of grouped stickies within a group, they are exited from the group.
		This is unintentional.
		The ideal behavior is
			Exit the group after dragging outside the group border.
			If it's inside the border, it's just a change of position.

To summarize, the conclusion is that it was a mistake to think that multiple moves in a lasso selection and a single move could be combined in the same code.
