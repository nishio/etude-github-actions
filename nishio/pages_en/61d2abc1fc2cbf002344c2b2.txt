Create a delay of arbitrary length
[https://youtu.be/q3JDTxxCXBU]

Using [PULSER]([MC2500]) in [CraftBook]'s [Integrated Circuits]
	https://craftbook.enginehub.org/en/3.x/mechanics/ics/
	I configured pulselength=10, startdelay=20 (in Game Tick)
	The actual delay was 22. This includes the delay caused by the lever.
	The actual pulse length was 11.

[Measure the circuit delay].
[measure pulse length].
