Repayment of technical debt overhead
>[@t_wada https://twitter.com/t_wada/status/1407145045577244673?s=20] The key to creating a [technical debt] repayment backlog and setting a fixed weekly quota is the "debt repayment quota [deduction]" method. It works better than the "do it when you have time," "limit the fixed weekly hours," and "negotiate each time you want to do it." / "Use velocity well to systematically eliminate technical debt."
Lower negotiation costs than negotiating as soon as it becomes necessary
