Tree and Rhizome
[https://gyazo.com/f6a2eb3171755d853bf64c7700b83b4c]
A [rhizome] is a rhizome. Unlike [trees], they have no center and are connected to each other.

[Deleuze] criticized the tree model since [Descartes] that "[metaphysics] is the center, and the other disciplines are derivations from it and cannot be compared with each other," and proposed the rhizome model.

Relevant issues from the perspective of "tree denial"

In his 1965 article "Cities Are Not Trees," Christopher Alexander, who would become famous for his 1977 book "Pattern Language," argued that real cities are not trees but semilattices. A semilattice is a mathematical term for a bundle that satisfies only one of the two conditions of a lattice.

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graph that admits a confluence in the tree. This is an even looser condition than semi-bundling. [DAGs] can be fully ordered by topological sorting.

The idea that "a belief is justified only if it is grounded in an obvious fundamental belief" ([foundationalism]) and the idea of mathematics as a system deduced strictly from a few "[axioms]" ([axiomatics], Hilbert) were criticized by Hans Albert in his 1967 "Critical Reason Hans Albert criticized it as dogmatic in his 1967 "Treatise on Critical Reason" (see [Munchausen's Trilemma]).

Since it is no longer possible to justify "individual beliefs" by grounding them, the idea of justifying the "correctness of a belief system" by the consistent combination of beliefs ([consistency theory]) has emerged. This is a system of knowledge without a center or underlying axioms, and is similar to the idea of a rhizome.
