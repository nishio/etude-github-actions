Dominion Extension: Adventure
I checked because it seems that [expansions after the adventure have higher card power].

code::
 {{c6::adventure}}:wine merchant {{c5::5}}
 Action-Reserve {{c1::+1 buy}}+{{c2::4●}}, place this card on the tavern mat
 At {{c3::End of Purchase Phase}}, if you have {{c4::2 Coins}} left over, you can discard this card on the Bar Mat at once.
I built a deck for [Anki].
　I'd be happy to share, but I'm making it messy for myself, so I don't know, maybe you'd be better off making it yourself.
