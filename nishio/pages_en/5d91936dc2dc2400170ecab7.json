Cybozu Culture
[Cybozu]'s [Culture] as of September, 2019 on [Work Style | Cybozu K.K. https://cybozu.co.jp/company/work-style/]

>Culture
>Even if a system is established, it is meaningless without an atmosphere that facilitates its utilization. Cybozu is committed to creating a comfortable working environment by embracing the opinions of employees while respecting the following culture: "[Empathy for ideals]," "[Respect for diverse personalities]," and the concept of "accountability and question responsibility" by instilling the following culture.
	>Culture of "[fairness]"
		>"To be able to say out loud that something is right even if it comes to light in public. We define this as the basic code of conduct at Cybozu for diverse employees to work in the same team.
	> "[Independence and discussion]" culture
		>With a focus on diversity, there is not always one answer, so we need a means for employees to constructively discuss and solve problems with each other. We repeatedly conduct in-house training on "problem-solving methods" and familiarize employees with the concept of "[accountability] and [responsibility to ask questions].
	>Culture of "purpose over rules
		>No matter what kind of system is used, if it is used without understanding its purpose, it is difficult to achieve the desired effect. In addition, it is important to share and sympathize with the objectives because it costs a great deal to create and operate a strict system.

	>It is important to share and sympathize with the objectives because it is very costly to create and operate a strict system.
 I think some people might interpret this as "It costs a lot to create and operate a strict system, so we should share and sympathize with the objectives, and each individual should bear the great cost of operating such a strict system", It is important to share and sympathize with the objectives, and to flexibly accept deviations from the rules or change the rules as long as they are in line with the objectives," rather than trying to create strict rules.
 Since the title says "purpose over rules," I tend to think the latter interpretation is the norm (for those accustomed to Cybozu culture), but I wonder which interpretation is more common in the world.
