store's subscribe and useEffect
There is semantic overlap between store subscribe and useEffect, but I'm not sure which one to use.
Is this how it should be or should I make it a LISTENER?
code:ts
  useEffect(() => {
    ...
  }, [store.getState().items]);

>It is a low-level API. Most likely, instead of using it directly, you'll use React (or other) bindings. If you commonly use the callback as a hook to react to state changes, you might want to write a custom observeStore utility. The Store is also an Observable, so you can subscribe to changes with libraries like RxJS.
