Long title engraving page

from [/villagepump/I need some good naming for "multiple links connected and wrapped pages"].

I don't know what to call this one[/icons/wonder.icon][/villagepump/takker.icon].
 [/takker/wrap page with multiple links connected].
 If anyone comes up with a good name or knows the name, please let me know.

 　to "stop using the legacy protocol of conversation.
 　I thought the combination of "conversation" and "legacy protocol" was interesting, so I made a link to "The Legacy Protocol of Conversation."
 　I opened "The Legacy Protocol of Conversation" and thought about it for a minute, but couldn't think of anything in particular to write about.
 　　But if we leave it as is, [future connection] is unlikely to occur (because the link string is too long).
 　　Smaller [hit detection].
 　　So I wrote the title as it is and used it as a link for "shorter keywords".
 　　 That's the goal[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 　　If I had found something to write about and did write it, I would have similarly made "conversation" and "legacy protocols" the links.
 　Plus, you mention "legacy protocols" on the "Legacy Protocols" page.
 　　[/nishio/legacy-protocols].
 　　The "legacy format" is placed here by association, leading to "liberation from the legacy format of books".
 So, based on that, I'm thinking "[long title engraved page]" or something like that.
 	Compared to "multiple links connected to a WRAP page," the timeline of the action is reversed.
 		Create a page with multiple short keywords attached to it.

	Oh, I'll make this one.
	It's a natural occurrence in the structure.
	Even when making a link with more than one word in a verse, there is a hesitation about where to chop it up.
		If you want to do it systematically, it is safer to make it long first and then make it [a page with multiple links connected and wrapped].

 Not a [hashtag for linking words that did not appear in the text], but the same kind of usage.
