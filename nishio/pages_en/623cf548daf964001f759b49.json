"Do not make all occurrences of a keyword a link" is not "a specific string of ~"
Do not make every occurrence of [keyword] a link" is not "Do not make every occurrence of a specific string a link.

My past self didn't understand this.
　The word "keyword" was poorly resolved.

Why not "make every occurrence of a keyword a link?"
　That would be the same result as if you had searched for that keyword on the search page."
　　If so, what is the problem?
　　Implicitly assuming "lots of hits" is problematic.
　　　If you search and get 100 hits, you can no longer list the results of that search at a glance.
　　　If this is the case, then there is no harm if we limit ourselves to things that don't hit a lot.
　　Another implicit assumption is "search."
　　　Implicitly assumes a human search on that substring.
