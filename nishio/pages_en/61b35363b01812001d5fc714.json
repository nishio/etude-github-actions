Tools to enhance cognitive abilities
If there is an expression that cannot be understood without a lot of [cognitive ability] (e.g., the amount that can be retained in temporary memory), and author A writes for S1, who can understand it, then from S2, who is not S1, what A writes is nonsensical crap.
Let us assume that a person with S2 becomes S1 by using a tool T that improves cognitive ability when used by a person with S2. For example, if a person with poor cognitive ability in terms of eye resolution improves [resolution] by wearing eyeglasses, this will affect the efficiency of reading, etc., and raise cognitive ability.
Isn't using T in this situation [someone who doesn't look at the moon through a telescope]?
