Someone is thinking of making the page description [atomic] ([atomic])
　[evergreen note should be atomic].

	Gendlin's expression
	　[https://gyazo.com/c5e15cac8079f9649b2686744b51776c]
	　It contrasts experiencing with AN EXPERIENCE.

 		　[* write about one thing only].
 		　However, as much as possible
 		　[* Write so that the whole picture of the matter can be grasped].
 		　is best
