Questions cause a flow state.
 Today I have a new understanding of the concept that "[questions] encourage [verbalization].
 Questions encourage verbalization, but "answering questions correctly" is not a prerequisite for doing so.
 Any question of [moderate difficulty] that is not so difficult that it cannot be answered, nor so easy that it can be answered immediately without thinking.
 It is more important to enter the [flow state] by considering problems of moderate difficulty.

 But you never know what questions will be of moderate difficulty for them.
 	Sometimes the other person thinks too hard.
  	You could answer more casually, but you try to remember everything you've said in the past to maintain consistency.
  On the other hand, you think too easily.
  	They oversimplify and think, "This is the only possible answer to that question, right?

 What should we do in such a situation?
 	There is no way to deal with it in advance.
  I have to take it as, "You think so."
