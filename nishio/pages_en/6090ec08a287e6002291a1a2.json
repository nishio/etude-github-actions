 Play Inca Gold. It is quite interesting. You are exploring a cave, and as you advance, you may get treasures, but happenings may happen and you may die. The only decision making is to choose "go further/return to camp" at each step. As you proceed, you will gather treasures at hand, but if you die before returning to camp, you get 0 points.
 
 There were 15 treasure cards, 1,2,3,4,5, 5,7,7,9,11, 11,13,14,15,17 I think. Happenings cards are three of each of five different types. Death occurs when two happenings of the same type occur. Treasures are divided equally. For example, if five people are playing and 14 is found, everyone receives 2 each, leaving the undivided 4 on the road. Those who return to the camp can retrieve the treasures left on the road.
 
 Before playing, id:tokoroten said "it's a game of chicken", but after playing it several times, I realized that the essence of the game is something else. First of all, the number of treasures left on the path changes rapidly, and the number of happening cards also changes, so at first glance, one might think, "Isn't this a game of probability calculation?" At first glance, one might think, "Isn't this a game of probability calculation? But in reality, there is an equal division rule including the way back home, so if you say, "Wow, there is a happening card, let's go home," you will go home at the same time as other players, and your share will be reduced. If you think about it only from an individual's point of view, "If you go back, you will be scored, and if you go forward, you will die in probability," so at a certain point, there will definitely be a situation in which it would be advantageous to go back. However, this means that other players will be in the same situation at the same time, and even if it is advantageous for you to leave if you are the only one who can leave, it will be disadvantageous if both of you leave at the same time. This is truly a prisoner's dilemma.
 
 When I first played with 3 players, I thought it was interesting, but then I played with 5 players and found it even more interesting: with 5 players, for example, if you get a 14-point card, the cards are divided 2 points each, leaving 4 points on the road, so the agony of whether to return or continue is much heavier. And it's easier to bump into more than one person when leaving.
 
 Yah, this is an interesting game.
