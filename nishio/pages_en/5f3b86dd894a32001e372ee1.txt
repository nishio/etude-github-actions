Assumptive = Hypothetical
>A person with a high level of [assumption] is a person with high [hypothesizing ability] but low [verification ability].
> Instead of "You are assuming too much," it is better to feed back "You have a great ability to create hypotheses, so let's get into the habit of [verifying] them with solid facts.

This is a good paraphrase
　Some people ask questions like, "How do [hypotheses] get made?" and "How do [ideas] get generated?"
　In the process of generating [hypotheses] and [ideas], we are temporarily in a state of [poorly grounded assumptions].
　If you don't like this "[lack of] evidence," if you don't feel secure that it could be so, if you don't have the [self-assurance] to trust your own ideas, or if you are insecure, you avoid it.
　[The rationale is to be added after the fact
　　If you ask for [evidence] early on, the idea breaks down.
　I really like how you commented on the often negatively perceived trait of "assuming too much," and then stretched it even further by taking it as a positive.
