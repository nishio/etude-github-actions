	>The recent trend of "Let's all start our own businesses!" seems quite irresponsible. Just starting a business at a young age attracts attention. However, in a culture where people celebrate the start of a business and then drop it when it doesn't work out, the mental risk to the entrepreneur is probably quite high.
	>It's a world where you have to be willing to say, "I don't recommend you become an entrepreneur," but you have to be willing to do it to keep going.
		So it's not a good idea to do it because everyone else is doing it, because "everyone else is starting a business!" So it's not a good idea to do it just because that's the atmosphere.
