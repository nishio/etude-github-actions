Type of efficiency
In industrial pipeline simulation games, there is often a desire for efficiency. There are several different types of "efficiency," depending on what resources are being optimized: time, resource consumption, factory floor space, and so on.

It is important to note that there are two types of time efficiency. That is, is the resource in-game time or player time?

relevance
　[what is called "assets" or "unearned income"].

suggestion
　In both cases, the more you get down to it, the more time you spend outside of the game.
　People who [optimize in-game time efficiency] make detailed plans outside of the game and then execute them.
　People who [optimize player time efficiency] see time away from the game to do other things as an alternative to gameplay.
