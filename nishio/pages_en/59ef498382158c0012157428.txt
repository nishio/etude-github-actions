 Creation of cardboard printing chips
  Basic fee 20000 yen + printing fee (number of sheets x unit price) [excluding consumption tax

  Unit price is high, over $100, so not something you can put in several mass-produced versions.
  However, since it can be made from a single piece, it is more suitable for prototypes than mass production methods such as cardboard die-cutting (initial cost of about 20,000 yen).
  It's going to be exciting to see it look good afterwards.
