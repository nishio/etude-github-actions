Dragon Task
>I have been getting around much better since I started adding the following icons to my daily to-do management.
> 🍅: 25 minutes per piece. Relatively easy to estimate time. I'll run a pomodoro timer.
> 🍊: 25 minutes per piece. Time estimation is somewhat difficult and should anticipate the possibility of a significant extension.
> 🍑: 25 minutes per piece. Whether you can do it or not, or even if you can't "complete" something in the first place, you finish it exactly in that time.
> 🍭: 10 minutes of relaxation.
> 🐲: a big one that needs to be done without regard to time required. Dragon.
