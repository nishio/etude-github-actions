Annotation of range
	What should I do with [annotations] in [scope] in [corpus]?
 For example, in [book corpus], "This range is source code."
	Proposal to include specific (unlikely to appear) characters before and after the range.
 	[Unicode Private Use Area] and so on.
 	Need tools to make it easier for humans to input data.
  	I like the idea of range selection and one click or shortcut.
  Cannot be read directly by the human eye
 Insert a specific string before or after the range
 	`<span class='code'>...</span>`
  It's good because it can be removed with a regular HTML parser.
  It is also possible to extract only the annotated range with a normal HTML parser.
  Somewhat redundant.
  I think this is the right thing to do.
