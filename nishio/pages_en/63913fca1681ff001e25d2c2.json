topic parallel

 Do you think [topic parallelism] can be done in [turn-based communication]?
  I think[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
  　There is [correspondence] in what has become a very large turnover.
  　 In correspondence, you write and send all the topics you want to write about, and they write and send all the topics they want to write about, so the topics are parallel.
  　 The decision to communicate with others and the rules that are somehow determined by the atmosphere determine what can and cannot be done.
   Only under limited conditions[/villagepump/basic.icon].
   　For example, I've established a topic in a long sentence on line, but not many people can do it.
   　We need a careful way to read and answer each one.
   　I wonder if I should vote not to think this way[/villagepump/basic.icon].
  I don't think [/villagepump/Toshiyuki Masui.icon][/villagepump/kuuote.icon][/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon].
