This can be done in a simpler form, unrelated to the word old, and it goes like this:.
	If Mr. A says that Mr. B's behavior is 'labeling,
	Mr. B can say that Mr. A's behavior is 'labeled.

from [three elements of senile behavior].
The label "[labeling]"

Not [boomerang joke], but an it-like structure (should this concept have a name? [Boomerang-like structure.)
