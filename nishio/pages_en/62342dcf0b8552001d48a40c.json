I. A. Richards
>Ivor Armstrong Richards CH (26 February 1893 – 7 September 1979), known as I. A. Richards, was an English educator, literary critic, and rhetorician. His work contributed to the foundations of the New Criticism, a formalist movement in literary theory which emphasized the close reading of a literary text, especially poetry, in an effort to discover how a work of literature functions as a self-contained and self-referential æsthetic object.
> 
> Richards' intellectual contributions to the establishment of the literary methodology of the New Criticism are presented in the books [The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism] (1923), by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards, Principles of Literary Criticism (1924), Practical Criticism (1929), and The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1936).
