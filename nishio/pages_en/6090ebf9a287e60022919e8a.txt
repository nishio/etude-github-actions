 I really don't need to buy additional Pirkle, but I think it's okay if I put the fermented one on the far left, you know. The difference in color between the new one and the fermented one of vegetable life is lactobacilli.
 
 I had done the same thing before with Yakult, so I wasn't worried about the fermentation area, but the cost of obtaining the seeds is cheaper than with Yakult, which comes in plastic bottles in small quantities. Also, before I put in one bottle of Yakult, so I think it was about 65 ml, but this time I put in a little less than half a bottle of Pirkle, so it was about 200 ml. Maybe because I put in more, the taste changed faster. I drank a cup of the enriched vegetable each day, and I could tell the taste was changing every day. The purple vegetable life was untouched during that time and I opened it on the 5th day, but now it tastes like "drink yogurt milk fat + blueberry".
