High energy water
When I heard the term "high-energy water":.

I just realized that if you collect various energies of the natural world at power plants around Japan, turn them into 60Hz waves invented by Nikola Tesla, "draw" them into your home through the "edges" that stretch all over Japan, and then pour that energy into the water at hand to make high-energy water to drink, it will be good for you! It would be good for you!
I came up with the technique of not only drinking, but also soaking in high-energy water and bathing and receiving energy throughout my body. You may have just discovered the secret to longevity. I have a plastic container at home that is just the right size to hold one person, so I'm going to fill it with high-energy water now and experiment with taking energy into my body.

	Power Plant: a power plant. Not a power spot.
	Various energies from nature: hydroelectricity is the potential energy of water, thermal power is the chemical energy of fuel. Even petroleum is derived from nature.
	Tesla invented the 60 Hz wave: AC electricity.
	The "edges" that stretch all over Japan: [https://ja.wiktionary.org/wiki/縁 edges means] "having some kind of relationship or connection", here referring to the connection to the power plant through the power lines.
　Attraction: often used in the form of "law of attraction", here it simply means to draw power.
　Pouring energy into the water at hand to create high-energy water: boiling water
　Drinking it is good for you: it is "white water".
　Entering and soaking in high-energy water, bathing and receiving energy throughout the body: "bathing" for short, the bathed person's body becomes warmer by receiving thermal energy
