 **1258606249*[Kaizen] Build a housing complex for the small stuff.
 If you don't decide where to put things away (home position), they will just go this way and that way and never get put away. I keep my things in a Daiso container with a handle and a tight-fitting lid. Because the lid is shaped like this, even if I accidentally knock it over, for example, the contents will not come apart.
 
 I used to have a "tool box" and "electronics parts", but this time I bought a new one and put it in the "tape and string" section. Because of the half-size of the tape, I couldn't fit it in the container that holds more small items, such as duct tape, masking tape, and string for binding magazines, and it kept rolling around, getting lost, and becoming a source of stress when I couldn't find it when I needed it. I'll just put them in this box the next time I find them and they'll be fine. The curing tape that came out from under the bed and the vinyl string that was on the shelf can be easily taken out from now on.
