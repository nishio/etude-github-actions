Estimating computational quantities
　10^7 I can make it in plenty of time.
　10^8 Probably in time
　10^9 Impossible except for very simple calculations

table::
 6.6	10!
 6.7	3 ** 14
 6.9	2 ** 23, (n ** 3)(200), (nC(2n, n))(11)
 7	余裕で間に合う (n ** 2)(3000), (C(2n, n))(13)
 7.1	(n log n)(10 ** 6)
 7.4	(n ** 3)(300)
 7.6	3 ** 16, 11!
 7.8	2 ** 26, (n ** 3)(400)
 7.9	(n ** 2)(9000)
 8 Probably in time
 8.1	(n ** 3)(500), (nC(2n, n))(13)
 8.2	(n log n)(10 ** 7), (C(2n, n))(15)
 9 much simpler, (n ** 3)(1000)

Here, on the contrary, the usable algorithm is calculated backward from the constraints.
