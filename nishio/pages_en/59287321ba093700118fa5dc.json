	[Markdown template https://github.com/yosukeo/markdown-inception-deck/blob/master/markdown-inception-deck.md]

	Five questions to capture the big picture
		Why are we here?
  	Communicate the significance of the team to the sponsors who fund the project
  Elevator Pitch
  	I want to "fulfill a latent need or solve a problem."
   For "target customers."
   The product named "Product Name" is,
   The "product category."
   This can be "an important advantage, a compelling reason worth the price",
   Unlike "the best of alternatives."
   It is equipped with the "defining characteristics of differentiation."
   p116 Elevator Pitch Game
  Package Design
  	Promote efficacy, not product features!
   	â†’[Gamestorming] p.87 "Cover Story" A game to imagine being featured in a magazine.
    	Cover, headline, column, quote, brainstorm, image
  Make a [list of things not to do
  	Do = problem to be solved, don't = don't care this time, decide later = decide later whether to do it or not.
  Find your "neighbors."
  	Clarification of [stakeholders] -> [PMBOK].
   Gamestorming p. 124 Stakeholder Analysis
 Five questions to materialize
 	Draw up a solution
  What is it about these issues that keeps you up at night?
  	Identify risks and agree on which risks to address
   Verbalize and clarify, rather than vague insecurity.
   Avoid situations where some people on the team are anxious and the rest are unaware of it
  Determine the period
  Be clear about what you are giving up.
  	[Trade-off slider]: Decide in advance which one to give up when multiple axes are [trade-off].
   The situation of allocating limited time to either of two tasks that have a trade-off relationship is time scarce, so it's hard to devote time to that discussion.
   So, discuss this in advance at the start of the project
  What and how much do you need?
