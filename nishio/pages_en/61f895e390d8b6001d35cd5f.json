	[Just as "appetite is not evil," so "desire for approval is not evil."]
		I noticed that logically, "appetite is also evil" also holds true.
	The "[date after if continued]" principle was easy to understand, so I thought I'd align with it.
	　I fixed the date position and the Stream became a mass of nonsense.
	　It's hard to know how to handle these "unimportant updates".
	　　Even if there was a "do not put on the update list" flag, as if it were PukiWiki, it would be a pain to click on it every time.
	　　Put them in "don't record updates mode" and people forget to get out.
	　　Do you do it and then say, "Oh, these corrections are trivial, so forget about it"?
	　　I don't care, it will sink in after a while.
	　　It's okay because it's an individual project, but if it's a multi-person project, there's going to be [reticence].
　As an aside, when I wrote "refrain" or something like that, I started thinking "what's the English word for this?"
