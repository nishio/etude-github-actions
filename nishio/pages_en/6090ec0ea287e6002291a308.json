 *1415503973*Restore Chrome bookmarks from backup
 My MacBook Air was damaged by water, and I wanted to restore the entire system from a TimeMachine backup, but the SSD capacity of the replacement device was too small to restore the entire system. Since I am planning to migrate to Windows soon, I thought it would be no use to try to restore the whole system since the system will be changed anyway, but the lack of bookmarks is inconvenient.
 
 Chrome bookmarks are located in /Users/nishio/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks. I copied this file and overwrote it with the file of the same name on the new machine, and the bookmarks were restored. Easy.
