Nodal Point of Thought 20210104
I started working on it after first putting up sticky notes that said "Activities for 2020" and "Things to do in 2021," which is a classic "[top-down] categorization mistake."
It is not right to form a group from the beginning in the form of "what to do in 2021" because a network/tree grows up by organizing 2020 activities and new things to do exist in scattered places as shoots of that tree.
(The time line is that the sprouts are clearly [verbalized] and then they are plucked and arranged.)

[The network of information is initially a tree.]
