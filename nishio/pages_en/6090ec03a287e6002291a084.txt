 *1268995257*[GAE]AttributeError: 'FooBar' object has no attribute '_entity' 
 (Note: I have a feeling this entry may contain incorrect content.)
 
 AttributeError: 'FooBar' object has no attribute '_entity'" error when trying to save on Google App Engine:.
 
 Model.
 >|python|
 class FooBar(db.Model):
     short_key = db.StringProperty() # unique key to use in URL
 
     def __init__(self):
         import utils
         self.short_key = utils.short_key_gen()
 ||<
 I wrote something like this, but it's wrong. I defined the constructor myself, but forgot to call the constructor of the parent class.
 
 >|python|
     def __init__(self, **kwargs):
         import utils
         db.Model.__init__(self, **kwargs) 
         self.short_key = utils.short_key_gen()
 ||<
 This is the correct answer. By the way, if the parent constructor is called after self.short_key = ... If the parent constructor is called later than self.short_key = ..., the constructor will create an empty property and overwrite it, so it is useless. (I know, I know...)
 
 Furthermore, I got a TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 1 non-keyword argument (2 given) in FooBar.all().fetch(1), probably because it contained an object created with such a broken constructor. I turned it off and started over and <del>it worked. </del> Not working!
