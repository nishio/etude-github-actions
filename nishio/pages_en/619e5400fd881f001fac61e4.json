choose what comes to you
The community's operating policy is the idiom "don't refuse what comes.
It's funny to think of this as if it were the norm.
　No college can admit everyone.
　No company will let just anyone in.
It is more special to be in a situation where "anyone can come in" and not be rejected by those who come.

In the early days of a community, "finding that community and wanting to join it" is a high hurdle in itself, so it's not strange to include anyone who has overcome that hurdle
　If the community is providing value to its members, this state will have more and more people.
　Shouldn't there be a gate at some point beyond a certain number of people?
