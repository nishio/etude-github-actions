Good team application
2022/12/31
I was going to write about it when I got it all together, but there's no sign of it coming together, so I'll just take stock since it's the end of the year.

No good feelings toward [team applicants] in the first place, as seen in [originality first before co-creation] in bits and pieces.

On the other hand, "no good feelings" could be "simply because I'm not used to it."

So we should not put them all together and keep them away, but observe them carefully and find the good ones.
　Related [attacks without trying to know what they don't know well].

A common "bad example" is somewhat more people.
　To avoid this, "ask individual members directly what each member is responsible for" and evaluate projects with unclear people downward.

However, it was argued that this was not enough.
　The same composition can occur with [old organizations].

discussion
　Do [driving forces] need to be clear?
　　Differences between long-term and short-term projects
　　In a project of six months or so, there's no time for multiple people to work out their visions, you're better off running full steam ahead under one policy.
　There needs to be a good division of labor with overlap because [the division of labor] is not going to go according to the theory on the table.
　　Ideally, the team leader should be able to work on the project alone, assuming all other team members are hospitalized
　How do we identify [alignment] within the team?
　　For example, ask different members about their vision and actions based on it.
　　If you do not share a common vision, it is extremely difficult to explain your actions consistent with a vision different from yours that others have told you on the spot
