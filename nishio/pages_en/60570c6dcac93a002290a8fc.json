Innovators do not need to convince existing experts.
When [disruptive innovations] in the form of "inferior performance takes over the market," experts on the incumbent side often argue, "This is inferior performance compared to the existing one."

There is not much information in this claim. The innovator side knows that performance X is inferior to the existing one. Often they intentionally lower it. Because it leads to another performance Y higher. See also: [Strategy Canvas].

The innovator does not need to convince existing experts. Whether or not what he creates becomes an innovation depends not on the opinion of that expert, but on whether the customer likes it or not.
