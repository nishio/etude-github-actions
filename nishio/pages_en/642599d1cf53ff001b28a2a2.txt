Saying the same thing over and over to AI.
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1641411556687908869] "I keep telling ChatGPT to do X, but it keeps doing Y! Am I using it wrong?" Some people say something like that, but maybe "yes" is the right answer. I know the log is a Few-shot, "Do Y back in response to X".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1641474335193038849] I don't know why people keep repeating methods that they know don't work, even in conversations with humans. They can't understand that their side is the cause because they blame others, saying, "I'm telling him all this, but he doesn't understand." To repeat the same thing and hope for a different result is insanity in itself.

It's just like when a scripting language with GC became popular in the past, some people said, "It's inexcusable that people start writing programs without being aware of memory".

It's a game of blurring" and start saying 8+13 is 30 (GPT4).

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1641629385341165568] Reproducing something like this, thinking "of course that's how it's supposed to be", is probably the equivalent of "something that a stranger would find at first glance ghastly, but can be reproduced with the expectation that it's supposed to be" in a programming language. I guess it's equivalent to "something that can be reproduced with the assumption that it's natural" in a programming language, and I feel almost the same way when I do it.
