Excellence resides in quality, not quantity
The first half is, "[Play by quality, not quantity].
[Quantity does not transcend mediocrity].
The second half, "[The misfortune of trying to fit in everywhere and not fitting in anywhere]" is from a slightly different angle. It suggests that trying to increase the number of people who accept you will lead to the misfortune of not being accepted by anyone, so instead of trying to increase the number of people you know, you should socialize with a small number of people. It is similar to "stop being a beauty to all sides" or "[pleasing the masses is bad].

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Excellence resides in quality, not quantity
xxvii
Praise strength over breadth.

Excellence resides in quality, not quantity. The best are always few and scarce; the more, the less valuable. It is often the case that even the giants among men are really dwarfs. Some people value books by their thickness, as if they were written to test brawn rather than brains. Breadth alone does not transcend mediocrity. The misfortune of universal genius is that it tries too hard to fit in everywhere. Intensity brings height and elevates one to heroic heights in sublime matters.
