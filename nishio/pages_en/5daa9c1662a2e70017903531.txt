Learning from the Young
I heard that "in this industry, you have to keep [an attitude of] learning from young people" and I thought it was very important, so I wrote it down.

To have an attitude of learning
	First, you need a [listening attitude] #Listening
	If you say a lot of things based on your own ideas without listening carefully to what the other person is saying, you prevent the other person from outputting information to you.
	If you interpret without listening to what the other person has to say, naturally "misunderstandings" will occur.
		Human language is not clearly defined or standardized.
		Communication always involves "misunderstandings" for which neither party is responsible.

	[Authority gradient], there is a high cost for young people to correct senior misconceptions.
		Actions tend to occur to avoid fixing trivial things because they are troublesome
		Failure to correct misunderstandings incurs significant costs in time delays
			Misunderstandings are the source of greater misunderstandings.
			Acting on a misunderstanding causes significant costs after the fact.
	Therefore, communication design that minimizes misunderstandings as much as possible is necessary.
