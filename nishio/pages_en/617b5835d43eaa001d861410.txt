Reading, Diary, Excavation
[https://gyazo.com/280e11356a89432c153e93842e954ab6]
　[Reading] is reading what is written.
　[Diary] is a written record of daily thoughts.
　　[If you don't write it, it will disappear].
　　If you write it, it accumulates.
　　[if you don't accumulate, you go around the same place].
　[Excavation] is digging through the "strata" in which my past writings are accumulated and stacked, and discovering what might be of value to me now.
　　Read this again.
　These three complete the cycle.

>I thought when I pictured it, "reading back" duplicates the "reading" element, the purpose of which is that you need a process to discover what you have written and make it the subject of "reading".
