Google Drive Search API
https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/search-parameters
It looks like you can search like `fullText contains 'hello'`.

It would be useful if you could put a [cut and scanned] PDF and it would automatically [OCR] it and search it.
	I'll give it a try, I put one of the PDFs there for now.
