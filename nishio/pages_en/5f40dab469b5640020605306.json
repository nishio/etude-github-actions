Reverse Reinforcement Learning
>Dramatically valuable survey paper on inverse reinforcement learning. It describes from the basic mechanism to the applications. The typical methods of inverse reinforcement learning (Max Margin/Max Entropy/Bayesian) are well organized and written.

>GAN], inverse reinforcement learning, and [energy-based models] can be regarded as the same thing, and other community techniques can be used, as long as the generated model G can be given a likelihood. For example, [autoregressive models] that can give likelihood to G in the current GAN can be used to stabilize learning arxiv.org/abs/1611.03852
