lignin
	Plants that advance above ground begin to compete with each other because the higher they grow, the more sunlight they get.
	Invent [lignin https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B0%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3]. Accumulating lignin in the cell walls will make them strong enough to support huge trees, even if the cells die and only the cell walls remain!
 No organisms were able to break down this newly created compound, so fallen wood and other materials accumulated without rotting.
 The wood later became coal, and this period became known as the Coal Period.
 Around the end of the Coal Period (about 290 million years ago), white rot fungi are able to degrade lignin
 This bacteria breaks down all the wood that was strewn on the ground.
 As a result, the amount of coal has decreased dramatically since this time, and the period is now referred to as the Permian rather than the Coal Period.
