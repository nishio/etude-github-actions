BOT to write to Scrapbox
Writing APIs are in demand, but they're being turned down.
[I want to create and update pages with API - Request to Scrapbox https://scrapbox.io/forum-jp/API%E3%81%A7%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%82%92%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3% 83%BB%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84]

>A lot of unintelligible automated posts by bots are put into a place where humans are creating page links and engaging in intellectual activity [and turning it into a garbage dump].
>The pages that are thrown in are not maintained with any links, etc.

Logically:.
　If you have a project where the bot writes separately from where the humans are active, why is that a problem?
　Why don't the BOT just maintain the link?
