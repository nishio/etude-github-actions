Mold thinking that had a similar thing in the past
 Patterns of [thinking], "something similar was done in the past, it didn't work, so this won't work either."
 Comparing the old one A with the new one B, they are not exactly the same but have various differences.
 　No matter how similar they may be, the circumstances surrounding them differ depending on the time of their appearance.
 Ignoring those differences and [equating] them with past failures is [an excessive generalization].

	It may save resources, but there is also a significant disadvantage of killing [innovation].
