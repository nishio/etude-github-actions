 I finished reading Diaspora and thought it was interesting, but then I was seized by some mysterious sense of loss and said, "Everything seems so boring. Life is boring! Life is so boring! What am I going to do? Then I realized that today was the last day of the month and I had to go to the bank to pay the rent. In other words, the feelings I just described are what I feel when I get into a situation where I don't have a clear "next task" to do.
 
 So I transferred the money anyway and came back.
 - Rent transfer
 - □ Boil 3 liters of beet tea and leave it to stand
 - □ When the sugar beet tea has cooled down, pour it into a PET bottle.
 - □ Labeling cables

 At any rate, I labeled the four cables. Now I don't have to worry about "Oh, what's the other end of this cable? But I made the mistake of choosing white and green for the color of the vinyl tape. Labeling in white against a white cable is not very visible. I'll get some blue next time and try labeling white extension cables and such. Would yellow be better?

 Hmmm. I'm running out of 11x11 mesh for the horizontal shelving, I'll need to restock a couple of pieces.
