metabolism
Some people seem to have a metaphor like "let's blow in a new wind" when they say, "we need a metabolism."
But how bone metabolism occurs, for example, is that osteoclasts break down existing bone and osteoblasts create new bone in the gaps.
Metabolism is [destruction] and [renewal], and the amount of destruction and the amount of new creation are in balance, so that destruction cannot be observed from a distance, but the components remain new.

PS
We tend to think, "Let's add something new," but first we need to "destroy what no longer works." (2018-02-17)
