Line to be crossed
[https://gyazo.com/69402d0eda3e902f69aeddcef84b1988]
First appearance [of a good idea].

The intention is not to meddle in other people's livelihoods, but to verbalize my personal values for myself so that I don't get lost.
Don't do a job where the line to be crossed is 60 points.
	The mentality of aiming for 90+ points and the mentality of aiming for 60+ points are polar opposites
	If you are doing the latter, you can't do the former.
	Do not deal with customers who demand "must succeed."
		To achieve "must succeed," we must lower the hurdles to be crossed.
		The questions will be set to aim for a score of 60 or higher.
	Work that continues to produce things that are not very good, but not very bad, is sterile.
