Faster moving of stickies
  Overlay at touch point
  	A mechanism that overlays the second Canvas as a layer for fast editing when editing, and reflects it in the first one after editing is complete.
  	Layers for fast editing can be placed on top at all times.
  		Check if the upper layer is transparent or not.
  			Well, if it's not transparent, you can just use the technique used in [Image at Zoom] to make it into an image and stick it in the background.
  			â†’It was transparent.
  Asynchronous updating of the back layer?
  	This can be put off to a later date at worst.
  	Initiate window system
  		Overlays shading on the moving target and draws only the window being moved.
  		Don't erase old ones.
		Verify that it is feasible at a realistic speed as it looks
	special timing
 	Moving stickies when there are 100 stickies out is also slow.
	  This would be a good idea to include the "border drag" that the Initiate window system used to employ.
	  If you move the sticky itself, it'll take 0.5 seconds to delete the sticky on the canvas behind it, so you'll see two stickies for a moment.
