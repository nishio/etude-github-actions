 *1204942180*PythonDeveloperCamp2008 Winter, Day 2
 When I woke up, two of my roommates were already up and working, so I panicked, thinking I had overslept, but it was 7:30 in the morning.
 
 I fell asleep twice and woke up at 10:00.
 
 *1204942622*doctest useful
 I used doctest to automatically test that the Jython code in the manuscript worked properly!
 7 Failures...
 
 
 Oh, you are picking up the &lt;/pre> at the end of the code. I replaced it and deleted it, and now I have one failure. And this is a test case that I intentionally put in myself that fails. Blessed, it works with Jython 2.2 without as much trouble as I thought it would. I'm really glad I'm using Python for compatibility.
 
 The Japanese language turnaround is indeed not going to pass the previous code.

 *1204949954* New and Maintenance and
 Writing new things is more fun. Maintenance is not fun. But maintenance is important. I need to finish the 2.2 support for the Jython book at this camp.

 I was able to do this in about 10 minutes on an unfamiliar Mac.
 
 source code

 SIZE = 600
 size(SIZE, SIZE)
 z = 1+1j
 colormode(RGB, 1)
 for i in range(30):
     fill(color(0.5, 0.3 + 0.02 * i, 0.5, 0.1))
     rotate(i * -0.47)
     rect(5 * i, 5 * i, 100 + 10 * i, 100 + 10 * i)

 If you Cmd+drag on a numeric literal, you can change the value like a slider. I was able to get a good twist on -0.47 and so on. This is quite interesting.

 *1204954375* If the internet goes out while writing.
 When I am writing a diary on Hatena and the connection is lost and the diary gets stuck in writing, I used to use Firebug to disable the submit button and send it again, but Firebug is not yet installed on this machine, and a reboot is required to install it. Now, what to do...

 I have to do what I have to do, not what I enjoy doing or what I enjoy writing. It's a pain in the ass to go around Japanese.

 >>> unicode("A")
 u'\u3042'

 u'\x82\xA0\x82\xA0'

 Hmmm. I guess it will be a unicode string as it is a byte sequence.
 
 >|python|
 >>> unicode("%sA" % unicode("A"))
 u'\x82\xA0\x82\xA0'
 >>> print _
 ????
 ||<
 So, even if you enclose it in unicode, it is still a sequence of bytes, and print will not display it properly.
 
 >|python|
 >>> unicode("%sA") % unicode("A")
 u'BB'

 Geez.

 Anyway, I captured it and sent it to Charlie.

 Well, it looks more like Python, but on the other hand, it exposes less of its contents. I'm not sure how to explain this...
 
 -----
 
 What I'm fixing now is fine because it's a Python explanation, but when I'm in an object-oriented explanation where I see that 1 or something is an instance of a class defined in Java, I might have a very difficult time explaining it if I can't get the class name in Java. Scary. I wonder if it will be ok.

 This 2.2 is now promoted without error.

 *1204983296* Shocking.
 The MacBook only opens to 135 degrees. Can you do something about this?
 
 *1204983963* Today's Diary
 Very dry eyes
 
 I've gotten to the point where I don't need to wear a Thinkpad if I just want to write in my journal, I can just use a MacBook.
 
 Kanji conversion is sometimes sutra. <= to such kanji.
 
 The last time I was at some kind of camp, I had to ask the front desk to send a receipt for one person in the name of the company, because I had not received a receipt and had to have it faxed back. I remembered this just now. (just in time)
 
 I guess I should be able to get out of my room quickly tomorrow since I check out at 10:00. I'm told that the conference room itself is rented for the whole day, so I'll work as much as I can and leave.
 
 There was a famous shrine nearby, so I drew a omikuji (omikuji) and got a boost for a project I've been working on recently and feel like I'm moving forward. I will do my best.
 
 No good, my dry eyes are pretty bad. Should I put some eye drops on and go to bed? My mouth ulcers are getting worse. My intestinal environment is also getting worse.
