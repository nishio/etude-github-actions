(1.2.1.2) How much time can you spend for learning?
Next theme is the time spent to learn. When you are a junior high school student, you went to school five or six days a week and was forced to learn for many hours a day. Conversely, you were able to use many hours for learning in a day. University students also can spend much time to learn what they want to learn.

Meanwhile, after you graduate and have a full time job, you spend most of your time for working. As no one gives you time to learn explicitly, you have to make it by yourself. Some people use commuting time or early morning hours for learning (*1). If you can learn what you want to learn during working hours, that is a privileged situation.

*1 You may hear the commuting train in Japan is extraordinarily crowded. It is true, but it is possible to shift commute time to avoid the rush or use ears to learn.
