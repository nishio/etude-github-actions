 *1235281539*Housekeeping
 Now I am being taken to Aoto because I took an express train on the Asakusa Line by mistake.
 
 Well, I'm home now. I just got back after two nights of "staying over at a friend's house. They were very critical of me for not having decided on a moving date and contractor yet, so I'm going to do my best with the housework today.
 
 This is a continuation of the story about the need to extract tasks first before task management. To extract tasks, it is necessary to first write down what comes to mind, and it is desirable to have as much flexibility as possible in the writing process, and to avoid the tedious double process of "writing it down and then registering it in the task list. Then, it is either paper or a single large text area. Paper has problems with reordering and deleting. A single large text area may be more suitable for those who are familiar with the keyboard.
 
 
 A new task of the following type was newly generated
 - [w] I have to stay home to pick it up until 8pm.
 I decided to write a legend. A [w] is a task that does not require active action on your part but must wait for someone else's action to complete. Waiting] is a task that is not executable, so its notation needs to be changed from TODO.
 
 
 The beet tea arrived and I am boiling it as soon as possible. Estimate for moving while boiling. Need the address of the new house. I look at my notebook. I haven't written it down yet. I'll write it down. ■Estimate.
 
 I'd say 18 plastic cases for refrigerator, washing machine, couch, chairs, books & sundries.
 
 <hr>
 Legend: □: TODO, ■: Done, [w]: wait (a task that does not require your active action but must wait for others to complete), ←: depends (completion of this task is necessary to start the parent task. The direction of the arrow should be the same as the flow of time.)
 
 - Important date and time: 2/28 16:00 on the first day of the month
 - Take a bath
 - ■ Throw a request for reshipment because the beet tea was probably delivered absentee.
 -- ■ Must stay home to pick up until 8pm
 
 - □ Refrigerator must be emptied and turned off about 3 days in advance
 -- Eating habits that consume what's in the fridge for the time being
 - □ Gas takes time to be opened, so you need to contact us as soon as possible.
 -- □ Find out where to contact and what to contact
 - □ If the electricity is not opened, the new house will be too cold to stay for a long time.
 -- □ Find out where to contact and what to contact
 -- □ Carry halogen heaters for now?
 --- □ ←Look for rubber straps to secure the luggage on the bicycle
 --- I don't think there is any advantage to carrying stuff by bicycle on my own, like stuff that is already in containers. Since the movers will eventually carry it anyway. So it might be a good idea to start with transporting unpacked items, etc. in bags or bags.
 - Is it quicker to disassemble the luminous (shelf) and transport it myself? There are long poles, is it possible to carry it by bike? If I can fix it, can I push it and walk it so it's not too far?
 - I was thinking about cleaning up afterwards, but then I realized I only have 5 days left, so I guess I'll have to move what I can carry to the new house to make room for the work.
 -- The shelves are a key part of the arrangement, so maybe we should just get on with it and haul them away.
 -- ← Create workspace for disassembling shelves (clear out to mid-room)
 
 - □ Setting up mail forwarding
 - □ Change of residence certificate, change of address for driver's license
 - □ I'm going to use howm on Dropbox because I don't want to write these work notes offline.
 - □ Wash the contents of the washing machine before moving
 - □ The notebook is full of old addresses and other information, so I will update the digital data in the near future, print it out and replace it.
