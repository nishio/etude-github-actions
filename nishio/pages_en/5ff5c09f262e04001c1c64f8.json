Introduction to [Exponential Time Algorithm] [Yoichi Iwata].

	What index?
		[Traveling Salesman Problem] [$ e^{n\log n}→2^n]
		[Maximum Creek Problem] [$ 2^V V → 2^{\sqrt{2E}} V]
		Width" of the graph
			[Grid graph] [pathwidth] is small
	What is the bottom of the index?
		[half whole enumeration] [$ 2^n→2^{n/2}]
		[Maximum Independent Set Problem] [$ 2^n n → 1.466^n n].
		Search algorithm 23
	[FPT Algorithm]
		Exponential time algorithm only with respect to parameter 𝑘 independent of input size
		[minimum vertex covering problem] [$ n^{k+1} → 2^kn].
			[Boundary search tree]
		kernel
			The method of pre-processing polynomial time O(kn) to reduce the problem size to less than or equal to a function 𝑓(𝑘) of 𝑘 is called [kernelizing], and the reduced problem is called a kernel
		[Steiner Tree Problem] [$ 3^kn2^km].
	[Inclusion-Desclusion Principle]
		[Hamilton path] in polynomial space
		[graph coloring problem] [coloring number][$ k^n→3^n→2^nn].
		[Fast Zeta Transform]
		[Folded]
			[$ (f\cdot g)(S) = \sum_{T \subseteq S} f(T) g(S \backslash T)]
			Faster DP for sets [$ 3^𝑛 → 2^n].
		The number of [perfect matches] [perfect matches] can be [$ O(2^{n/2})
	[Color Coding]
		[k-Cycle] Determine if the graph contains a simple closed path of length 𝑘 [$ n^k → (2e)^km].
	[Bandwidth] Arrange vertices in a row and minimize the length of the longest edge [$ n!→5^𝑛].
	[Cut & Count] Steiner tree problem on a grid graph c^w
	[Iterative Compression] Determine if a tree can be formed by removing 𝑘 points from a graph 3^k
