Should we avoid informative materials?
Which is better, "written material" with a lot of information or minimal material that is a tool to perform?

Disadvantages of written materials
 Preparation is hard work.
 The audience is so focused on watching that they don't have time to think for themselves or write down their questions

Advantages
 Audience can read it back later.
 If it is made public, people who were not able to hear the lecture will know the content.

Written materials are beneficial in the early stages of your career
 I received an invitation to write an article for a magazine after publishing my lecture materials.
 When I was approached to give a talk, I said, "How about this content?" and present it to them.
 Study session materials that had been released in an unorganized manner are being read unexpectedly.
 From if statements to machine learning, read by a total of 170,000 people. How many times would I have to talk about this if I wanted to do it in a face-to-face talk?
	Consultations are brought to us after viewing the materials we have made available to the public.
 Substitute for a business card (far more informative than a business card)

I still perceive myself as early in my career.
