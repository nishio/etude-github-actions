 First of all, the basic premise is that there are people in the world who say NO to everything.
 There are people who are blessed to have grown up without meeting such people, surrounded by people who affirm them.
 That person is surprised when they are told NO for the first time.
 And try to understand why they are saying NO.
 I assume that they are saying NO based on a misunderstanding, and I assume that if I explain it properly, they will understand, and I spend the cost of explanation.
	But that is just an observation of a previously unobservable phenomenon, not something that can be eliminated with a lot of effort.
	It is necessary to understand the fact that "there are people in the world who deny themselves," not as a denial of one's own personality, but as a mere fact, a mere natural phenomenon.
	Conversely, some people grew up receiving negative messages.
	Tend to block communication because communicating with others has been learned in a negative way. Tend to build walls.
 When these people meet someone who comes over the wall and says positive things about them, they overestimate their value.
 It is possible that the person is a good person, but in many cases it is someone who has learned that "it is easy to befriend a wallflower if you approach him in a friendly manner.
	The only way to bring evaluations closer to normal values is to increase the number of evaluators.
