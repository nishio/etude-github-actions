　Thoughts.
　　Relationships that are the same character are transitive
　　　So we can figure out how to split the set of integers less than or equal to N into one or more sets.
　　From the conditions of the standard form, the number of occurrences at a point is less than or equal to the maximum number of occurrences up to that point, x+1.
　　　Otherwise, the replacement of that number with x+1 would be smaller and contradict the conditions of the standard form.
　　So it looks good for DFS to choose the options in ascending order up to the number +1 that appeared before at each point
	Official Explanation OK
