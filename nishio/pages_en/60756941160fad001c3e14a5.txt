  What Tasks
	>Clarify what you can get out of the task
	ã€€What would you like to see happen by doing that task?
ã€€>Subdivide to the point where the goal is visible.
ã€€ã€€What is the task to be completed?
	>I know what to do now.
	ã€€Next Action Questions
	ã€€What will you do next with respect to that task?

Another idea is to port the current version as is.
ã€€Even if it remains the same, the UI is different, so it will inevitably change.
