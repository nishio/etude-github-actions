What is correctness?
 Part of a talk given to junior high and high school students at the [Nada School Saturday Lecture 2014].

	Correctness is to be as correct as it can be for something for which the correct answer is given.
 So what is the rightness of something for which no right answer can be given? #TruthTheory #Philosophy
 	Logically [foundational]? → science can't do it.
  One-time events cannot be repeated [experiment] by experiment [disprove] → [one-time] events cannot be repeated [experiment].
  [Pragmatism] → [after the fact] can only interpret what was [beneficial] as correct.

14 those that already have the correct answer.
The final exam that you are all taking right now.
Entrance exams taken to get into college.
Qualification examinations even after entering the workforce

When you enter a research university to conduct research on something for which there is still no correct answer, there is no correct answer to your research.15 Product DevelopmentThe majority of your life is spent in product development at a company. In product development as well, you launch a product thinking it will sell, but when you launch it, it doesn't. In life, you follow the path you think is right. In life, too, we follow what we think is the right path, but only when we die will we know whether or not it was the right path.

16With no way to compare and grade the correct answers, I started worrying about what is "correct" then. Well, I didn't start worrying about it until I was about 30 years old, so I thought, "Why don't you worry about it earlier?

17Correctness can be roughly defined in at least three ways: logical correctness, natural science correctness, and decision-making correctness.

[https://gyazo.com/28cffa7e98fa9ba2115f9089341fafe2]
18 ! From the axiom correct axiom that we have decided to be correct.
Logically derived that logically correct procedures combined with pure mathematical correctness

#Fundamentalism

[https://gyazo.com/5ff4e1c1cbc1e048ddc353d1373bdd20]
19 ! From the textbook explanation in the textbook that is supposed to be correct.
Logically derived, if it were a proof problem in mathematics, you would get a circle if you could combine the information from the textbook to form a proof without any logical gaps, and correctness in exam scoring.

20Correctness of Natural Science

[https://gyazo.com/9d1d30141ba956b1f54b527997677fb2]
21 "Experiments confirmed it!" Even if you reproduce it by experimenting 100 times, there is nothing logical to say whether it will reproduce the 101st time or not. Specifically, for example, if you catch 100 birds and they all fly, can you conclude that "all birds fly"?

[https://gyazo.com/70125daddf4342356da5618bda4288f8]
22 By that logic, it would mean that natural science is not correct, and according to the definition of correctness in pure mathematics, it cannot be claimed to be correct.
But if everything that scientists believe to be true is not true... then scientists are in trouble, so they decided to change the definition of correctness. If you follow the pure mathematical definition of correctness, you cannot claim to be correct

[https://gyazo.com/3602e2e20851791bc673cb23d0f16b51]
23Correctness in Natural Science! Let's just accept the claims that others can disprove and that have not been disproved at this point as correct and proceed with the research. If it is disproved, let's say it is not correct. This is how we have changed the definition of correctness. The definition of correctness differs from that of pure mathematics.

#Refutationalism

24 Now let's think about the correctness of the decision-making process.

[https://gyazo.com/a04c94c4bf4e28dbb46bbbf3ab3482be]
25To be more specific, was your life choice to enroll in Nada the right one? Was it right? What do you think? There are a lot of people grinning.

26I should have gone to a co-ed school, it was a mistake to go to a boys' school...... possibilityI went to engineering at university and out of 90 students there were only 2 women and I never had a chance to talk to any women on a daily basis...................maybe I went to a boys' school? I was in a boys' school.... I thought, "I must have been in the wrong boys' school!

[https://gyazo.com/39fae4650b698055cca3cf4968a3fa44]
27So, let's do a control experiment to see if we were right in joining Nada or not, and let's decide which one is right based on the happiness level of the one who joined Nada!

[https://gyazo.com/a9ad90417e35bd5d90b02b0cfcb69a8f]
28And while we're at it, let's repeat the experiment several times, because one experiment may be a fluke, so let's repeat the experiment 10 or 20 times!

[https://gyazo.com/6e377f8613b73b96aab06e090cf83cad]
29That kind of thing is not possible in life; there is only one timing. You cannot get the results of an experiment on the side where there was no choice. You can no longer verify what life would have been like if you entered a co-ed school now. You can't do that.

[https://gyazo.com/ce591de6313e9749e7f5f7556b7cca86]
In other words, most of life's decisions are incorrect, or at least cannot be claimed to be scientifically correct. So what do we do? Well, there must be another definition of correctness, and if we follow the definition of correctness in the natural sciences, we cannot claim to be correct.30

[https://gyazo.com/05f7b3967d08dcac5fde99bd8cbccbde]
31So how do you define decision correctness?

[https://gyazo.com/3b9eb3b4777ebb2de1457dd5f9fbd78b]
We have no choice but to decide that Let's say we define it this way. I am sure there are many opinions about the correctness of the decision-making process. I will explain what I think is right at this point, so if you have any objections, please write "I think this way" on the survey form! Whether or not the results of your actions were beneficial to your life

[https://gyazo.com/97136b58936cf3dfa65e20c7d5adf0fe]
33 So by that definition, it is derived that it is not possible to know the correct answer before an action is taken. It is futile to try to know if the action is correct before the action is taken, and futility, by this definition, is not correct.

[https://gyazo.com/e8c6e6ac42a700c62713b863b5f7cce5]
34 Also, since the definition includes "for my life", it is derived that there is only "what is right for me", which is right for different people. Of everyone here, some will be glad they joined Nada, and some will regret it. It is different for everyone and there is no general right answer.

[https://gyazo.com/7f717861ab66745bdbc981ef0e9b2c63]
35It is easy to get stuck trying to get the universally correct answer before acting, and yet we tend to seek the right answer. For example, if you are interested in a woman, is it better to give her roses or sweets? This metaphor may not be clear to many people. For example, when choosing a university, would Kyoto University or Tokyo University be better, would it be better to go abroad, or would it be better to take a leave for a year and go around the world to gain social experience before entering university, etc. Opinions are useless because there is no right answer before action, and rightness does not coincide with others.
