The Intellectual Production of Engineers Author's official page
The author's official page of a book is generally created in static HTML. The reason for this is that the distribution period of a book is longer than the lifetime of a web service, and it would be a problem if the URL on the paper is disconnected for reasons on the web service side. However, as of 2018-07-26, I am very interested in networking knowledge using Scrapbox, so I dare to experiment here.

 	Newly ranked #1 in Amazon's "General Management Engineering Books" (Books > Science & Technology > Engineering > Management Engineering > General).

  It continues to hold the #1 position in Amazon's Books > Computers & IT > Programming > Development Techniques, but I just noticed that it is now #2 in Books > Science & Technology > Engineering > Computer Science > System Administration & Audit.
  In overall programming, it's 5th.
  I doubt if this book is a programming book....

 	Q: Do I have to be an engineer to read it?
  A: As the author, I believe that the examples are only intended for engineers, and that the technology is essentially field-neutral. I don't know how much the fact that the examples are for engineers will affect non-engineers, so please browse through them...
