[Review of group blind elephants - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%A4%E7%9B%B2%E8%B1%A1%E3%82%92%E8%A9%95%E3%81%99]

The story is that the discrepancy is because they are observing different areas.

>This story involves several blind men (or men in the dark). Each of the blind men touches a different part of the elephant, such as its nose or tusks, and they discuss their impressions. However, their impressions differ depending on the part they touched, and the conflict deepens as each insists that he is right. However, for some reason, they realize that they are different parts of the same thing, and the conflict is resolved.

>Jainism
>In Jain lore, six blind men were asked what they thought it was, in the form of touching an elephant. The blind man who touched the foot replied, "It is like a pillar. The blind man who touched the tail said, "It looks like a rope. The blind man who touched the nose said, "It looks like a tree branch. The blind man who touched his ear said, "It is like a fan. The blind man who touched his belly said, "It is like a wall. The blind man who touched his tusk replied, "It is like a pipe. Hearing this, the king replied, "You are all right. You are all right. The reason for the discrepancy is that you are touching different parts of the elephant. The elephant has all the characteristics you describe.
>The moral of the story is that the same truth may be expressed differently, and it illustrates the principle that those with different beliefs can coexist with respect for each other, sometimes referred to as the seven blind men. This is a discourse based on the Jain idea of relativism.
