scheme
About the scheme or [schema
　Latin for "form."
　　highly abstract
　Someone who wanted to refer to a "form" in some specific sense, but wanted to distinguish it from the "form" (form) of everyday speech, used the Latin vocabulary
　　The "object" in object-oriented design is a "thing", but we don't want to call it a "thing", so we call it an object in English.
　This was done by different people in different fields, so the word has become difficult to understand the meaning.
