I've been observing how he does it, and he [breaks it down] into radicals. My son and I know very little about radical names like hen and kanmuri, but he loves those parts, and he explains to me things like, "This is this for tsukuri and this for hen.

Then they recall the scene in which the word was used and guess that it is used in this kind of situation.

He doesn't memorize the kanji as if they are the only ones floating in the air, but rather he does the work of where they are located in the network and to which they are connected in his mind for a while, so he learns them almost in one shot.

If you position the new kanji in the network and check which one it is connected to, it is easier to remember it because the knowledge is connected in a network-like way, apparently.
