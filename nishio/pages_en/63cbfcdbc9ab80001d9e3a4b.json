If I get a comment saying, "I'm not thinking of [lowering the price]. He said that if I answered, "I plan to raise the price next week," they would buy it immediately. A request for a price reduction is merely saying, "I want it! is just saying, "I want to buy it. So, I should make an "excuse" for them to buy. I am learning a lot.
