smelly person
Comparing a certain human characteristic X to a smell

	Smelly people are less likely to notice that they stink.
	People around smelly people often do not point out the "smell" but simply keep their distance
	Some people "smell" even at a young age, due to unhygienic lifestyle, etc.
	The parameters of the system change as we age, making us more prone to odor even if we maintain the lifestyle we had when we were younger.
 Self-care can make it harder to smell as you age.

I used to call this trait X "[old person]," but I was wondering if there is a better term for this trait X because it can occur even in younger people.
　[human bug, not old man].
　　But calling them "human bugs" seemed to stretch the boundaries of the concept too far.
	This time the expression is not "stinking old," but simply "smelly."
　The key point of this concept is that "smelly people are less likely to notice that they smell," not that age matters.
	　For example, there are "young women who wear too much perfume and smell bad.
	　Until now, the word "old" has been too closely coupled with the age thing because of the "old" in the word "old".
　I don't think "stinky" is better than simply "stinky" because it's significant to separate that from the rest of the world.
