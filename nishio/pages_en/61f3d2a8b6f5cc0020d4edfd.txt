There are few supporters of integrity
This is a difficult story to interpret.
There is a distinction between "one who is always on the side of truth" and "one who is wise."
I don't know if the author thinks one position is better than the other or if it is neutral.

There are few supporters of the "one who is always on the side of truth." They are willing to fight friendship, power, and self-interest for what they consider "rightness." The "wise" bend the truth to avoid getting in the way of superiors and national objectives. But "those who are always on the side of truth" consider bending the truth a kind of treason and value truth over wisdom.



from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
There are few supporters of integrity

xxix The upright man clings to the righteous sect by his tenacious purpose, and neither the passions of the mob nor the violence of the tyrant can ever cause him to overstep from the right boundaries. But who can be such an equitable Hoonyx? How few are the supporters of the hoenix of righteousness! Certainly many admire it, but it is for others. And hypocrites deny it, and politicians cover it up. For they do not mind fighting for friendship, power, or self-interest. Then comes the danger of desertion. The wise then make plausible distinctions so as not to get in the way of superiors or national causes. But those who are honest and constant regard falsehood as a kind of treason, and value tenacity over cleverness. Such persons are always on the side of truth, and if they do depart from a party, it is not from whim, but because others first departed from truth.
