　Thoughts.
 　I want to maximize my score, but if the section is flagged and all flags are flagged, NG
 　N is 8 and a partial point. In this case 2^8 streets can be searched
 　N, M another partial score at 5000, full score at 100,000.
 　If there is a point that a section does not cover, then self-evidently "select all" is best
 　Considering the case where a section covers everything, just drill a hole to allow for one point somewhere that is not covered.
 　If you select one hole, you need to remove all the sections that overlap it, and that's enough, at this time the score is reduced by the sum of the scores of the "overlapping sections" compared to when you select all of them.
 　Therefore, the problem is to find the minimum value by adding the scores to the interval
 　　If there is a point not covered, the minimum value is zero, so no case separation is necessary.
