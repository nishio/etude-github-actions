Anonymous Coward
>If you post anonymously without logging in, your posting name becomes Anonymous Coward (meaning anonymous [coward], AC), and you are restricted by the aforementioned moderation system and the inability to post a large number of consecutive posts. On the other hand, there are many technical people who provide valuable information annotated with "I'm an insider, so I'm AC. ......," and such comments are sometimes rated as "helpful" or the like by the site's moderation system.
