>Social relational capital is a term that refers to "[trust]" held toward others, "[norms of reciprocity]" expressed in terms such as "haves" and "have-nots," and "[networks]" that are the "bonds" among people. It creates "[group] cooperation," which is difficult to appreciate in the marketplace.

	Social relational capital = [social capital].
	Network = [human network] = know who you are talking to, can talk frankly [psychological safety].
	Group cooperation = [teamwork].

A state in which these are present in the company leads to higher productivity than a state in which they are absent.
Therefore, we consider it a type of capital similar to "having money or production equipment" (so-called [capital] or [financial capital]) or "having knowledge" ([knowledge capital]).

Although the literal translation is "social capital," it is sometimes misunderstood as social infrastructure such as water supply, so the term "social capital" is chosen to avoid misunderstanding.
