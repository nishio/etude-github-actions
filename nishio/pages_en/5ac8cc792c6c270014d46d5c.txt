Are you anxious to learn a new area?
	Is it [anxiety] to learn [new areas]?
  A: Anxious to do something for the first time because "learning a new area" in a meta sense is [a first experience].
  B: Uncertain because it is unclear whether investing time in learning in that area will [pay] off
		C: Learning new territory makes me face up to my ignorance, which hurts [my self-esteem] and makes me anxious

Some people seem to be uneasy about it, but I don't really share their uneasiness.
	A: Not the first time learning a new area to begin with.
 B: On whether to [pay
 	I don't think you should do something like "everyone around me says it's good to learn X, so I'm going to learn it," because the odds of it paying off are low, but if not, I think it could easily pay off with [a niche-top strategy that multiplies the number of people around you].
  The possibility that I am more [optimistic] than average when it comes to investing in such [risky] things.
   Well, [early adopters] are [irrationally optimistic and insensitive].
  Strategies for smaller initial investment can be used in combination
 C: Face your [ignorance
 	When you're learning a new field X, you certainly face up to the fact that you don't know X.
  But, for example, when I learn about intellectual property, even if I am ignorant about intellectual property, the engineers around me are even more ignorant.
  I'm certainly more clueless about intellectual property experts, but he's more clueless than I am about programming.
  	Is this a [glass half-full of water] kind of idea?
   The cup is not [full], so there is a shortage, but I don't feel guilty about it.
			To say that being full is good is to believe that fullness is possible in the first place, but it is impossible for humans to be full because there is already an amount of information that cannot be absorbed over a lifetime
