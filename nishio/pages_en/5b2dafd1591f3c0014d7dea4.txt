reductionism
The reason why we have thought that we can understand things in a reductionist way is because mankind is too stupid to realize the limitations of reductionism, and we finally began to realize that we are too stupid to understand when computers beat humans in Go, which has long been enjoyed as a game with a difficulty level that cannot be solved by reductionism. The computer finally began to realize that it was too stupid to understand.
I have always disliked people who claim that "humans are superior to machines" and wish they would be destroyed quickly, so I am glad that more and more people are realizing this and coming over to our side.
