脱HTTP
[Latest Chrome does not allow HTTP images to be displayed on HTTPS pages].
　We need to do something about it.

I don't know what to do.
 Proposal to use other services
 　Advantages: Easy?
 　Disadvantage: You sometimes do more than just static delivery.
 　　Maybe set up an API server that does a little natural language processing and returns...
 　[Github Pages]にする
 　　The theory is that you don't need a server because you're just delivering the data statically anyway.
 　　I've maintained that it's convenient to have a server when you want to do a little something, but you haven't done that in years, you'd rather use heroku or netlify.
 　[Cloudflare]を手前に置く
 　　Hmmm, it was mentioned on Chrome's blog, etc., but in a big way...
 　　I guess that's as far as one can go with the free plan...
 　Shove all static-distributed images into Gyazo.
 　 Theoretically, it's not impossible, but that's about it.
 　　I need to go around and re-post the URL.
　Distribute with HTTPS on your own.
　　I'm probably at the level where Apache is probably running right now, so I'm just going to start looking into it.
　　If you're leaving it in that state, there could be a security issue or something, and since you're not maintaining it properly, shouldn't you avoid a situation where you have to maintain it yourself?

Do something that is not a static delivery.
　I didn't bother with [pLinkSuggest] or other typical examples, and when I looked into it, I found that I had deployed to [heroku] and it was HTTPS on its own.
　　Oh, I see, I was designing it according to the official manual to put [gunicorn] between the two, and this is where HTTPS comes in.
　This might be the easiest for this application...
