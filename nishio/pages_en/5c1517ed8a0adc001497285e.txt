	Where the translated text is placed: [/intellitech-en].
	Finished translating up to chapter 1.
		112 pages in terms of Scrapbox at this time.
			In paper pages, 55 pages, so about twice as many.
			The table of contents has 70 headings, so about 1.5 times

	[/intellitech-en-private] with the Japanese manuscript.
	First, a rough Google translation
		Outsourcing â†’ Done
	Look at it and see if there are any strange translations.
		In the meantime, I'll read it as I put it on Grammery.
			You should delete the text on Grammery every time, sometimes suggestions you ignored are resurrected.
		Option 1: Correct the original text
			Write here: [Improvement for English version (~1 chapter)].
				Initially written neatly, but decided to write messily because cleanliness of this page is not an important goal of the project accomplishment
		Option 2: Correct the English text
	Put it in [/intellitech-en] with only English text
		Image modification: [- easily done in Keynote].
			Do not. Write a word-for-word translation. It is fine as is and can be outsourced.
		Release them sequentially rather than after they are all done.
	Convert to e-book format with LeanPub by the end of March.
		Even if the translation is not all done, release a machine-translated version at a low cost for now.
		Upgrade later at no cost.
  For those who can't wait, a machine-translated version will be released, and so on.
	 Write on the side of the book that it is a machine translation and that the real translation is being done on Scrapbox.
