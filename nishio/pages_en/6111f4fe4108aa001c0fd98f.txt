People who interpret "surprised" as a slight.
Some people see the statement, "I'm surprised to see such a question on a question site," and interpret it as "poking fun at the questioner."

When I saw this, I almost wrote in a [boomerang joke] kind of mood, "I'm surprised that some people would interpret the expression "surprised" as a small mockery," but I stopped because it would be interpreted as "more people making fun of me" no matter what I thought, and that would be annoying.
