False True/False Dichotomy
Special case of [false dichotomy
Falsely assuming that a statement is "either true or false" for a given statement.

Example: The
 Let f(x) = y. Is "f(x) is greater than 0" true? False?
 explanation
 　True if "f(x) is greater than 0 for some x
 　False if "f(x) is greater than 0 for all x
 　f(x) is greater than 0", where the range of x is unclear, cannot be determined as either true or false.
 　Statements of the real world are often unclear
　 　In this example, it's attributed to [quantifier], but it's not limited to that.
