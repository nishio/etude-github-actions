　Thoughts.
　　The point is, the difference can't be the same.
　　No K and N-K either.
　　I don't know how many assignments would be OK.
　　　M must be less than N/2
　　　Oh, it says > [$ M \times 2 + 1 \le N]

			Now if N is odd, the rest are even, so they're all guaranteed to be at different intervals.
		This doesn't work when N is even, the rest of the numbers are also odd and covered.
		　Looks good if you shift one half.
		　If M is even, the length taken in the M/2nd and the remaining length match, so we spread 1 there.
		　After that, they will all be even numbers, so they won't be covered.
　　I'm sure there's a bug that could cause a discrepancy of 1 or so at the boundary, but it's better to implement it and squash it with a small test case than to think about it in my head.
　Official Explanation
　　Style that creates both odd-length and even-length clumps
　　　The length, not the evenness, prevents overlap.
