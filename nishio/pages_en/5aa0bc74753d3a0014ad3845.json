Traders, translators, interpreters
 The [traders] just bring it from where it is to where it isn't.
 The [translator] brings it from one place to another and translates it into a form that the people there can accept and convey.
  Therefore, the recipient's understanding of [knowledge structure] is necessary.
 The [interpreter] translates and conveys the questions raised by the receiver of knowledge into a form that can be understood by the sender of knowledge, and [translates] the knowledge gained back into a form that can be received by the receiver.
  So both people's understanding of knowledge structures is necessary.

	I've been calling them "[knowledge] traders," but if we're going to make this kind of division, it's more appropriate to call them [information] traders, because what they bring is "something already detached from people." see [information and knowledge].
