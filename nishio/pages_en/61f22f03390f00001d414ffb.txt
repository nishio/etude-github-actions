[(Column) We can not communicate bi-directionally with books]

The title of the column is "Books are not a two-way communication", but I thought the main topic was "(so) first create an emulator of the author, then mix their thoughts".

I also thought that "[defending and breaking]" was a very relevant topic.

By the fact that I am worse at English than Japanese, when I see an explanation in English, I have a feeling of "What do you mean, draw a diagram" toward the author (the author is me).

I thought of [new skin bag] in Matthew 9, but after reading the original, it doesn't really fit.

The fourth edition has a few additions, but those were not in the bottom of the English version. I'll need to work on looking at the past revision differences and reflecting them after the translation is done.

Q: Thoughts swirling while reading, do you persevere?
A: It's the same place where my thoughts swirl while I'm reading, and of course I don't hold back.
As in Chapter 4, p. 129-130, record anything you think of.

Apart from that, for example, when you want to organize it as a sticky note, you can use
The fact that "this was in the book" and
I am talking about organizing only the former first, without integrating the "I interpreted it this way" interpretation.

When taking reading notes, for example, some people divide their notes into left and right hand columns, with the contents of the book on the left and their thoughts on the right.

Q: How many times do you read about naive methods that should be compared?
A: Chapter 3, p. 87, talks about how you think you understand a lot when you read it many times, but in fact you don't.

I would like to say that this kind of interactive exchange is a great way to create links between scattered sentences.
