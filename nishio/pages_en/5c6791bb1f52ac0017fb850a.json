	[Intellectual Production] of [Programmer
	Derived from the debate about whether programmers' activities are [intellectual production or knowledge production
	There are three phases between the programmer's activities to create value
	1: First, the programmer outputs the program.
		You can call this knowledge production if you want, since humans are producing information.
	2: Phase in which the output program becomes a set of tools ([tool]) with the computer.
		This is "[production of tools]" and "[manufacturing]" so it is "production" but not information or knowledge production
		In [Engelbert's Four Categories], this is the generation of "[artifacts]"
	3: Phase in which tools increase customer productivity
		The "process by which a person produces something" exists beforehand, and the tools created in Phase 2 improve the productivity of that process.
