 *1361011249*Diary of tax return
 It's tax filing season again this year.
 
 First, I review my past diaries: 2012 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20120229/1330442259'>Final Tax Return Diary</a>, 2011 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne. jp/nishiohirokazu/20110227/1298819036'>e-Tax diary (failure)</a>, <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110305/1299329458'>e-Tax diary ( Complete)</a>.
 
 I am going to let my wife, who has never filed a tax return before, make her e-Tax debut.
 
 My wife first issued a user identification number, but was frustrated when she got stuck in an endless dialog with the continuing "Please point to your card before proceeding". I think it might have locked up. Let's move on to my side for now.
 
 I entered my user identification number and e-Tax PIN that I had recorded last year to search for information. I found it successfully. I looked at it briefly, but since I didn't move this time, it seems that I don't need to modify it as I did last time.
 
 When I hit the Create Blue Form button, I got the "Do I have to save?" dialog appeared. I canceled it. In fact, if you scroll down, there seems to be a "Save" button further down the "Return to Top Screen". Press the Save button to save the input up to this point.
 
 Press the Create Blue Return button again. The next screen appears. Well, there is nothing difficult in this area, just answer the questions as you are asked. I choose the cash basis blue tax return. The "Income and Expenses" form appears, so I enter my income and expenses. I am also asked for the address of the business, so I enter it as I am guided. I had scanned all the information when I submitted my business registration and put the PDF file in the Cybozu Live shared file, so it all went smoothly. (Stemma)
 
 You cannot send only the financial statements and income/expense statement data. Please use the Income Tax Return Preparation Corner to prepare your income tax return data, and then send it together with the financial statements and income statement data. When you exit the "Income Tax Return and Income Statement Preparation Corner" (the screen that displays "Thank you for using our service"), you will be asked to enter "Thank you for using our service". Please click the "Start Preparing Income Tax Return" button on the "Prepare Income Tax Return" screen ("Thank you for using our service" screen) and continue to prepare your income tax return data. That's right.
 
 Continue to file an income tax return. If you are preparing a new income tax return, if you have income tax data (extension ".data") for the previous year or earlier, you can use that data to prepare your income tax return". Hmmm, I wonder if they have that...I searched for data in my PC and found it. I tried to load the most recent one.
 
 >>
 This screen shows the names, etc. entered in the previous screens (personal information for 2012) and the names, etc. of the data read (personal information of the data before the previous year).
 Please check that there are no errors in the imported data for the previous year or earlier, and click the "Next>" button.
 The portion of the information that differs from what is shown will reflect the person's information for the year 2012.

 Oh no, nothing has changed from what was already filled out. Was it necessary to have it read? I thought, and proceeded to the next page.

 If there are items that do not need to be loaded on this year's return, please uncheck the items.
 For details on items to be loaded, click on the item name.
 Note that no monetary items other than the amount of loss carried forward can be read.
 
 check
 -Personal information (address, name, and other information about the person)
 -Payroll information (all payroll information)
 -Refund account information (information on the financial institution to which the refund will be transferred)
 -e-Tax Information (Information on e-Tax)
 <<
 
 Yeah, it might be a little easier not to have to re-enter company and account information.
 
 Proceed and you will get a page to enter "Income and Deductions". Pressing on the type of income will bring up a pop-up to enter the details. Let's start with employment income. The input columns for employment income are similar to those on the Gensen Choshuhyo (Certificate of Withholding Tax) that you receive from your company. The columns are so small that you may miss them, but I have marked the "Deductible spouse" column this year, so I must make sure not to forget to enter it.
 
 A screen comes up that says, "Enter spouse's name and income." It says, "Spouse's salary and other income," so I guess this means I should enter the amount paid on my spouse's withholding tax slip.
 
 Next, click on business income to bring up the detail entry page. The total amount is carried over from the previous blue return, but the details are not filled in, so we fill them in. The address of the payee is listed on the previous tax return, so it's easy.
 
 When I entered the information, a dialog box appeared stating that the total income withheld exceeded the amount written in the "Income (Business, etc.) -" section.
 The reason is simple: I received 14,444 yen from some place and had 1,444 yen withheld, but I mistakenly wrote it as 13,000 yen income. If I don't make it add up, a dialog box keeps popping up and won't let me save it, so I'll just assume that I received 13,000 yen without withholding tax.
 
 Please confirm that the amount of income and income is the same as the amount of income and income from the "Preparing Financial Statements/Income and Expenses Statement" section. If you want to correct the amount column, please click the "Next" button in the lower right corner of the screen, and then click the "Go to the section for preparing financial statements and income statement" button in the lower left corner of the "Input income and deductions" screen. The following is the information.
 
 In the financial statement preparation section, the amount of income was corrected by 1,333 yen more. Enter in the breakdown of business income that this same amount was deducted at source.
 
 Creation was completed. We are happy and satisfied.
 
 It asks me to enter the account to receive the refund. I thought you carried over from last year's data.
 
 Now, it is time to send the form. After inserting (or reinserting) the IC card into the IC card reader/writer, please click the "Finish Input (Next)" button. I got a "Next" message. Scary, scary. I think I'll probably get a dialog asking for my password before I click "Next". I'm going to have a cup of tea and wait for a while.
 
 It didn't answer, so I pressed "Next".
 
 On the "Submit Declarations, etc." page, I thought this blank space was originally the one where the Java applet was running.

 Apple has announced that it has taken steps to uninstall the Apple-provided Java applet plug-in from all browsers in the "Java for OS X 2012-006" security update for Java for OS X released on October 16, 2012.

 So that's how it is. I don't see any "Missing plug-in" but let's install it from http://java.com/ja/download/mac_download.jsp?locale=ja anyway. First of all, I'm going to "save data" because I'll be sad if all the data up to this point is lost.
 
 I installed it, restarted Safari, tried it, and this time got a "plugin not found" message. Oh well. I'll try rebooting the OS for now.
 
 Rebooting does not solve the problem. Hmmm.

I thought it might be possible to make e-Tax itself work by installing an older version of Java plugin, but that would make me vulnerable to attacks that exploit Java vulnerabilities.
 
 Windows has somehow created an installer that does all the various installations at once. After installing the card reader driver, I ran the installer with everything and it completed easily. Load the saved data in Windows and press the "Send" button. The transmission was successfully completed.
 
 Oops, I forgot to write down the deduction for medical expenses. Since this is my first time to deduct medical expenses, I was a little confused. It seems that I should classify the medical expenses by the payer and the person who received the treatment, add them up, and write a rough description of the treatment (e.g., dental treatment). I added the medical expense deduction and resubmitted the form.
 
 My wife, for various reasons, didn't want to wait until Monday to have her electronic certificate reset, so she chose to submit by mail.
