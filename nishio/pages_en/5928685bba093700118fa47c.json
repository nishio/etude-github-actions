Because [Scrapbox] looks like "tags", people who have experience with existing tools that "allow more flexible organization than [hierarchical classification] by tagging objects" tend to misunderstand it as "that kind of thing, right?

It became clear when shokai said at the Scrapbox drinkup, "You didn't come to this venue knowing the latitude and longitude, you came from the station along the road" [metaphor]. #link is a road
The tags make it easier to find, not by ticking off a scale in space and organizing it according to a frame, but by connecting paths between pages. see [Imojiru Search].

[Scrapbox displays pages two hops down from the currently open page, which is equivalent to drawing a two-level mind map centered on the current point. In other words, it is equivalent to a two-level mind map centered on the current point.

In the case study presentation at drinkup, it was also mentioned that tags should not be added very often at first, but rather, important words in the text should be [link], and when the text is reread the next time, keywords that were thought to be "missing" should be added with tags. I think tags are "an emergency tool to use when you know that the links by page association don't connect well with just the words in the sentence, but you know you need to connect them to a specific place.
