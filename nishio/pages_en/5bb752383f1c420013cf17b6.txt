humility
[I think the dichotomy of [humility] and [arrogance] is incorrect.

Your ability plus external factors is the outcome.
I can observe the results, but not my ability.
If you blame external factors when results are poor and attribute them to your own abilities when results are good, you will overestimate your own abilities.
[correspondence bias] [Dunning-Kruger effect].
Suppose we are comfortable with calling this arrogance.

Conflicting with this is blaming oneself when results are poor and blaming external factors when results are good.
It is not a virtue. It's [condescension], a lack of [self-esteem], or some kind of psychosis.
We're in a situation where neither end of the dichotomy is good.

What is right is [moderation], a proper evaluation of the self.

[false dichotomy].
