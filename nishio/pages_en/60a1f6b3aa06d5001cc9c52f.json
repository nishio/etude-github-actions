Remote speaking engagements can be recorded.
>[kazunori_279 https://twitter.com/kazunori_279/status/1377948937672265728]: In the past, when I was speaking at a big event, I would practice many times to make sure I could speak smoothly. I can take pictures and edit them myself, so I can cover up my lack of practice by patching things together.
	>[kazunori_279 https://twitter.com/kazunori_279/status/1377972360356110337]: Also, as I'm doing right now, after I've finished filming and edited the video, I take a quick look at it and then take additional shots where I want a little more explanation. I'm like a movie. It's like a movie.
	>[kazunori_279 https://twitter.com/kazunori_279/status/1377985598196129800]: I always listen to podcasts at 1.5 - 2.0x speed, which makes me talk too fast.
	>[dancerj https://twitter.com/dancerj/status/1377952679809323009]: if you're worried about the angle of the material, or something like that, and you have to take it over and over again, you might get really good at it in the meantime.
	>[kazunori_279 https://twitter.com/kazunori_279/status/1377971641750220802]: yes, it's like rework = practice :)

>[lestrrat https://twitter.com/lestrrat/status/1377977891011485696]: I don't leave it up to the recording, but rather let the staff watch me as I speak. I'm not leaving that part to the recording, but I'm trying to watch the staff as they are speaking. I ask the staff to explain what is missing in the content, and the slides are created (or re-created) by the production team.
	>[kazunori_279 https://twitter.com/kazunori_279/status/1377980941335818240]: You can fix the slides. If there is a staff, I prepare to some extent so as not to cause trouble, but if I record and edit alone, I end up re-shooting like Kubrick on the spot :) I'm not a perfectionist, I'm just out of practice.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1377959024285544462]: I recently heard this and it was an eye-opener for me, but in the case of remote speakers, there is no need to be there [in the flesh] to speak, so in the case of non-catch-all lectures, there is no need to speak in real time. I've heard that you don't need to be there to speak in real time, and if that's the case, it's better to film it in advance and edit out the mistakes, and the speaker can respond to questions in real time via chat. twitter.com/kazunori_279/s...
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1377959664957018112]: When I was asked to give a lecture, I had been thinking that I would prepare materials in advance and speak on the day of the lecture, but after hearing this story, I was shocked to think that my intention to speak on the day of the lecture was just an old man's move, drawing on past practices without any basis. But when I heard this story, I was shocked to realize that my intention to speak on the day of the event was just a move of an old man who is dragging the customs of the past without any basis.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1377962150359011333]: There are lectures where there is interaction with the audience and there are one-way lectures where there is no interaction with the audience, and if you want the former, of course you need to have a mechanism to facilitate feedback from the audience. If you want the former, you need to have a mechanism to facilitate feedback from the audience, and if you want the latter, you can't help but be compared to a YouTube video and told to "play it back at double speed, unedited and unsubtitled, sub-channel quality.

>[hiro https://twitter.com/hiro/status/1377960799348555777]: I think it depends on what kind of place the event organizer wants to create. Each event has its own characteristics. I think it is better to talk about it live, and I think that hybrids will increase in the future.

>[nagise https://twitter.com/nagise/status/1378125476737155075]: you're right. In a live show, there is interaction, but if you do it remotely, you can't really see the audience's reaction. On the other hand, if it's a live show, if you don't focus on interaction, what's the point of doing it live? That's what I was talking about twitter.com/nishio/status/...
