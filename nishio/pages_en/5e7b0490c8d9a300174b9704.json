I heard that the automatic font size adjustment is hard to see, so I tried various fixed font sizes.
　[What happens when you align font sizes?]
It is easy to see that three Japanese characters are on one line without line breaks, so I adopted that part only.

　Lowering the font size limit would make the case for one or two letters unnecessarily small.
　If you put in the constraint of not breaking the line after two letters, you can't separate the four letters into two letters each.
　Prohibited line breaks with two characters only if the text is three characters long.
