I can make it if I want to.
 If Mr. B sees that Mr. A has made something up and it is highly regarded by society and says, "I can make something up too if I want to.
 If "can be made" is true
  If I had been willing to make it and made it before Mr. A, I would have received high praise myself, but Mr. B, who was not willing to make it, was incompetent.
 When "I can make it" is not true
  Mr. B is incompetent, falsely believing he can make something he can't even make.
 Therefore, either way, Mr. B is incompetent.
