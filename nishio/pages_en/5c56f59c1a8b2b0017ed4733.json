Individual activities become teamwork after the fact.

I'm going to use this line.
	Individuals act [voluntarily] based on their judgment that "it would be better to act this way" (=[stand play]).
	The actions are connected [after the fact].
		In retrospect, it looks like [teamwork] (=[teamwork resulting from stand-up])
	But they did not plan to work as a team from the beginning (= not a team player)
We recognize that this is the case.

relevance
	[Don't ask permission if it's a good idea.]
		Acting without asking permission is necessary for stand-up.
	[Connecting the Dots]
		The dots are connected after the fact.
