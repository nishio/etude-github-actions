What is the point of a human learning something that an AI can answer?
The question is, "What is the point of humans learning what GPT4 can answer?" is the same question as "What is the point of humans walking when they can get around faster on a train?" I think it is the same as "What is the point of walking if we can travel faster by train? If walking itself is enjoyable, then walk. If the purpose is to move around, then take the train. Stopping and asking, "What's the point of walking?" accomplishes neither [Twitter https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1635860988900835328?s=20].
