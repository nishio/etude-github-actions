Useful Knowledge
"What have you learned that was beneficial to you?" This question may be a sterile one, because what was beneficial in the long run equals what was applicable in a wide range of areas, so it is inevitably highly abstract and often not accepted by the questioner even if he/she answers. In my opinion, the following were useful: "[relativization of correctness]," "the concept of pre[post]," "the concept of [unexpected X]" ([unexpected success]), and "the relativization of the [meaning] of a word."

Thinking back a bit, [dimensional expansion], [body expansion] and [random variables] were also useful knowledge. When I was writing about body expansion, I thought that "[relativization]" would be useful, since this is also "[relativization] of the concept of number". And this use of the word "[relativization]" is itself a [personal metaphor] (relative to the meaning of the word).
