>Before joining C-T-R, in 1911, Watson raised the motto "[THINK]" at an early morning meeting of NCR's sales managers. On that day, the sales managers could not come up with any good ideas on how to improve their operations. Disappointed, Watson stepped forward to the front of the room and chastised everyone. The problem we all have is that we don't think hard enough," he said loudly. Knowledge is the result of thought, and thought is the foundation of success in any field of business," he told everyone. Watson decided on the spot that "THINK" would henceforth be the company slogan, and he ordered his staff to post a piece of paper with the word "THINK" in bold letters on the wall in their rooms the next morning.

Many IBM employees carried pocket-sized notepads with "THINK" imprinted on the front cover.
