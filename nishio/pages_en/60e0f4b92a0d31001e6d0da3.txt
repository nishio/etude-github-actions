Why do you assert this?
Why do people make assertions about things they cannot or should not assert?

Regarding "A could be X or Y, but you assert that 'A is X.'"

　Possibility 1: Observations are so small that we have only seen cases where A is X
　　It's common for young, inexperienced people to do this.
　Often people who are not young and have a lot of experience assure us, why?
　　Even if you don't observe it, you can imagine that the world is not colored one way or another.
　　　Possibility 2: Lost imagination for what is not observed.
　　Are we losing the ability to recognize what we observe?
　　　Possibility 4: The memory of diverse X and Y results in the past is no longer being recalled and is being replaced by the simple "A is all X" memory.
　　　Possibility 5: Early on, the person had the belief that "A is X" and subconsciously ignored information that contradicted this belief.
　　　Possibility 6: Early on, the person had the belief that "A is X" and actually created the "A is X" situation through actions based on that belief.
