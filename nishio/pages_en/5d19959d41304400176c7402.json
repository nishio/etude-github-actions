	As a result, the "Post Sticky" button is no longer necessary, instead a method is needed for explicit line breaks
		[Need a way to put line breaks in stickies]
---
I'd prefer to see more and more stickies added to the line breaks.
	In the first place, I made it possible to put line breaks in stickies, but that was the default for debugging purposes.
 	For the actual use case, we'll default to a one-line text sticky note.
 	As you draw more and more of what comes to mind, line by line, more and more temporary stickies are added to the screen,
 	I think it's appropriate to say that
	'When I can stick to fixing the way it looks, I stick to it.'
		Preferred use should be easy and undesirable use should be cumbersome.
	Default multi-line import screen?
	Stickies are added more and more on a new line, can I go back and change them?
	not concerned about one's appearance
