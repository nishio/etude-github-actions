KJ method from surveys is the most difficult.

What to do when you see a label and want more information about it
　1: Label with your thoughts
　　→Then ask yourself, "How can I elaborate on this?" Ask yourself
　2: Labels created from multi-person brainstorming sessions, etc.
　　→Then ask the person who offered that opinion, "How would you elaborate on this?" ask the person who gave the opinion, "What do you mean when you say this in more detail?
　　　If you are trying to sort out labels later, you won't know who to ask if you don't have a record of who they came from.
　　　If there's a place where all the participants are gathered, you can ask them there.
　3: Labels created by picking up from "long descriptions" such as books
　　→Reread the relevant sections of the book.
　　　We need to know where the books come from.
　　　Spatial arrangement of the table of contents ahead of time makes it easier to identify where what you read originated.
　　　You can also write down the page numbers (though it's a hassle).
　　　If you're looking for an ebook, just search for it.
　4: Labels created by picking up from "short descriptions" such as free-text sections of surveys.
　　If it's a name survey, it would be 2.
　　With an anonymous survey, there's no way to dig deeper when you're not sure about the labels.
　　I have no choice but to try to classify them by the superficial meaning and similarity of the strings described.
　　Ask questions of people who are familiar with the context of the survey target.

The easiest and quickest way to do this is with [label of your origin].
