A system with a delay
[https://gyazo.com/7d59127f0242e601bf086abac68d62c0]

　When you see y increase right after x increases, many people interpret it as "as x increases, y increases".
　But in reality, that often doesn't happen.
　It's a system where "as x increases, y decreases, but there's a delay in that change."
　It is difficult for humans to recognize this [delay].

 context
 　A state of emergency was declared due to the spread of COVID19 infection.
 　　>I strongly urge you to refrain from leaving your homes during the month of April 7 to May 6.
 　Number of suicides in April, down about 20% from the previous year

 　From this observation, we observed a case that was interpreted as "if you curb going out, suicide will decrease."
 　That interpretation is a leap, an interpretation that overlooks the delay.
 　The [stress response] is a delayed process, so the stress-induced reaction of curtailing the outing has not yet occurred.
