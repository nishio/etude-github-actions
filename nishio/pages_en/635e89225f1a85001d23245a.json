Two Kinds of Spirituality
I was looking at the following conversation and thought, yes, that's what I'm trying to organize.

In other words, in [spirituality].
'Self-confident spirituality.'
There's "self-doubting spirituality."

People who are [confident] in themselves do not need science or other [authoritative] reasons for their decisions.
　[I am the guru.
　[confidently] speaks of his judgment.
People who are unsure of themselves want to feel secure by letting others be the judge of them.
　I want to be subservient to Oyasama.
　When I see someone who is confident, I try to [subjugate and reassure] them.

Science appears as if it is "unsure" because it is good for "not asserting what we don't know".
　Therefore, "those who want to be subordinated to the confident" tend to selectively subordinate themselves to the unscientific.
　This posterior observation is sometimes called "spirituality."

When broken down in this way, science and spirituality are compatible.
　I'm a Doctor of Science and a "self confident spiritual" I guess you could say.
　We use science as the standard of judgment when it comes to the domain of science, but when it comes to what it is not, science is powerless and we should not try to be scientific.
　A classic example of what is not the domain of science is an individual's life.
　　Whenever I take an action where I don't know if the outcome will be X or Y, it always has a favorable outcome for my life."
　　　Even if I think X is better at this point in time, it may turn out to be Y.
　　　It is "because the result Y was preferable.
　　　We just don't yet know why that is preferable.
　　This unscientific belief has considerably lowered the psychological cost of actions with uncertain outcomes, and even in situations that other people would consider "failures," I am guided in my thinking toward learning from the fact that I failed and thinking about what to do next without experiencing regret.
　　And this is where the science comes in and says, "When other players are overly risk-averse, the risk-takers benefit," and "Therefore, it is useful to have this unscientific belief.

She also has good luck in raffles. So when my mother said with a straight face, "I don't want to go to the food stall, I have a bad feeling about it, I'm definitely going home," I thought, "What's going on? I had no choice but to obey her. My mother is strong.

I've heard that the ki of a living person is stronger than that of a non-living person and that bad religions are especially smelly... I've heard that many of those people are praying to local Shinto gods and ancestors in the first place. Many of them are praying to their local Shinto gods and ancestors.

In a way, those who have it are like friendly gurus who themselves don't take money on a small scale, and like-minded people are friends and fake gurus are treated as fake...
