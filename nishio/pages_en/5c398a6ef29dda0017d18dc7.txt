What we want to do and what we can do
What I [want to do] cannot be taught by others, so I have to verbalize it myself.
What you "can [do] relatively better than others," that is, your "[strengths]," are surprisingly sometimes better understood by others than by you. What others consider painful may not be painful, what others consider fearful may not be fearful, and what you consider natural may not be natural to others. Because that is a strength.

So the "[unexpected success]" of being unexpectedly appreciated is useful in knowing one's strengths.

On the other hand, you have to remember that it's just [someone else's evaluation] and it's not what you want to do.

When you are [hungry for recognition], you are so happy to be appreciated that you will do anything to be appreciated. That is inevitable, and it is beneficial to do that temporarily, but the self does not exist as an extension of that. The self is rather at the root.
