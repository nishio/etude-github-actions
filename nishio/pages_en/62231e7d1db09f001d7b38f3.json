		What is "one" in the case of "one"?
　　The human experience is a blur without clear boundaries that can be thick in places.

　　　If you try to describe the dense areas of this diagram, how much of it is "just one thing" and how much is "the whole of that thing"?
　　　You claim it's "best if it's ~ and ~," but is that feasible?
　　　　A clear boundary can be achieved by wrapping only one grain.
　　　　Seems unfeasible for something that has no clear boundaries.
　　This "should be atomic" is
　　　It's not, "You can always be atomic, so you should try to be atomic."
　　　I think it's, "There are a lot of things you can't do atomically, but hopefully you can make it as atomic as possible."
