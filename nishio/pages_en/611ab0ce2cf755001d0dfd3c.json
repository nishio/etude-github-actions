Weak Scrapbox for collaborative editing
Scrapbox is great for collaborative editing, but what if we dare to weaken it?
　Gain another strength by weakening something existing [strategic canvas].

page unit lock
　One person with WRITE-enabled per page
　The edit button will attempt to acquire a lock, and if it does, it will be a general split view in a markdown editor such as HackMD.
　Editing is auto-saved in seconds
　User explicitly releases locks
　Lock is released if no renewal is made for a certain period of time.

What can be gained by this
　The program can be written via API in the form of an attempt to acquire a lock, and if it doesn't apply, retry in an hour, and so on.
　After acquiring a lock, there is a guarantee that user writes will not be covered, so there is no problem with a "read the entire page, do various processes, and then write it back" type program.
　For example, if you are writing something in a notebook and get stuck, you can write "@keicho" and close it, and the keicho bot will come and leave a question.
