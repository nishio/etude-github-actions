What I made last time to see Coin PerCard

This only deals with the deck as a whole, and you don't know what's left in the deck, so you need a system to keep it separate.

It's done.

It seems to be important to predict what will be drawn next, so I simulated 100,000 times and put them out in order of frequency.
Also, we added a logging function so that you can look back on how things have changed.

　T4, play the blacksmith, 8 coins, here would be gold coins.

cutting off the research institute
9 coins, but if I couldn't pull it off, I'd buy the lab.
Oh, pull it off, 8 coins, then we'll buy a genshu.

It's hard with the current UI to return the silver coins after seeing them under the Guard's effect.
　You draw, play the silver coin in your hand, then discard it, separately acquire the silver coin and put it back in the discard back in the deck, and because you're really top-decked and don't know it, the simulation of the next draw doesn't work and you have to draw by hand.
　Either add a button to return the card from your hand to the top of the deck.
　Or, since there are so many cards that temporarily look at deck taps, put a "put in not hand" button next to the current random draw button, and give the cards in that zone a "discard, discard, return to deck top" button.

　I really wanted to combine them into one scatter plot, but I couldn't figure out how to do it in Google Spreadsheet, so I just laid them out roughly to scale.
　Horizontal axis is the number of cards and vertical axis is the average amount of money coin per card
　In the blacksmith stero on the left, the amount of gold increases to about 1.3 while monotonically increasing the number of cards, then declines as the winning points come in
　In the right lab pullout, it's going up and down around 0.75 and then down.
　If you're going to pull off a village blacksmith in a workshop, you're going to get more pieces even faster than a blacksmith stero.
　A chapel stero would increase the amount of money at a fast pace once the number of cards is reduced, and would decrease at a faster pace once the victory point is bought.

>Chapel - Copper - Copper - Silver - House: 29%.
Is this okay to leave the silver coins?

>Chapel - silver - silver - silver - silver: 75
With only 6 chapels and silver coins in the deck, this is inevitably what happens, but I'm not sure which is correct, the gold or the gentry.

Oh, I feel like I made a mistake (maybe I bought a genus for 7 coins? ), there's no way to check or go back and redo it, so I'll have to start all over again from the beginning.
I've got the logs in CSV format on the screen for easy copying and pasting into a spreadsheet, but I'm getting them in JSON, so I'd better put enough information in there and add an Undo button or something.

It's done.
