Two before several.
>There are various proposals for methods of "knowledge creation with multiple people," such as "group flow" and "brainstorming," but considering the principle that "[the more people, the harder it is to control]," the most controllable "multiple people" are "two people," so we should not jump to the conclusion that "two people" is the easiest to control. Before thinking about a large number of people, it would be better to first establish a firm footing on how to conduct [knowledge creation through dialogue].
	>For now, it's interesting to think of the various methods as "what would happen if I used them in a dialogue between myself and one person who doesn't know the method?" It is interesting to think about it.
 >I think the problem of "[someone] not speaking up" is less likely to occur in a brainstorming session when it is one-on-one.
 >Tokoroten: I tried [Brainwriting] the other day and it solved all those problems and did pretty well.
