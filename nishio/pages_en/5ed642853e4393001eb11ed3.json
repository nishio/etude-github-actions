grouping
	Exit the group if dragged outside the group
	No, it's not. We have to think about it right.
 Not "Exit when a sticky in a group is dragged outside."
	And if a sticky in a group is dropped on top of another group, I want it moved.
 And if I drop something on top of a group that is not in the group at this time, I want it to be in the group,
 In other words, we need to determine if the thing is in position to drop.
 I want you to be in the innermost group when groups are nested.
　If you pull one out of a group with only two elements, should the rest be ungrouped?
　　It is not good if an empty group is created by taking an element from a group with only one element.
