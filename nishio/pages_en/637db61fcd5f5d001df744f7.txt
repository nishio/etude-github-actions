What cannot be read cannot be expressed.
Just as you cannot speak a foreign language you cannot hear, you cannot program in a programming language you cannot read.
The same is true of drawing; what cannot be "read" cannot be expressed. However, anyone can "see" and think he or she is able to do so.
from [Diary 2022-11-18].

Ah, I finally realized that I was looking at what I had verbalized in my mind outwardly, and this is what you call "[eye contact].
	The concepts of "ocular" and "[cognitive resolution]" are close.
		Wrote 3 years ago [eye, literacy, resolution].
	It seems that training in [drawing] trains you to let go of [the belief] that you are able to see things correctly and train you to see [them] correctly.
		[What I learned only after 12 hours of drawing cylinders].
	 When you put it that way, it's a concept that's also close to the Buddhist "[sh≈çmi]".
