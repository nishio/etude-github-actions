Test of the mode without last minute boost
before
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I added a mode without last minute boost, so I tested it.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "last minute boost" is that?
[nishio.icon] Parameters that make it easier to select words included in the immediately preceding human statement as the target of a question.
[nisbot.icon]What "parameters" are those "parameters"?
[nishio.icon]I changed it and nipped it out to make it easier to experiment, but after trying it for a while, I fixed it at a higher value because it had to be reasonably high to be chatty.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "experiment" is that?
[nishio.icon]I tried changing how much emphasis should be placed on the word immediately before, but this experiment was based on the assumption that it would be used as a chat, so if there is a use case where that is not the case, I may change it.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "experiment"?
[nishio.icon]Oh, I didn't deploy the server-side fixes w

 Where is this "experiment" located?

 Is there anything else about this "last minute boost"?

I started asking questions like this early on, citing old stories instead of last minute ones.

Long Conversation Test
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]Talk for some length of time in a mode with no boost just before and see how it feels.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "last minute boost" is that?
[nishio.icon]Focusing on keywords in a human's immediately preceding statement.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Talk for some length of time in a mode with no last minute boost to see how it feels.
 Is there anything else about this "last minute boost"?
I'm thinking it's necessary for a [nishio.icon]chat-like experience, but I'm not sure.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "experience" is that "experience"?
[nishio.icon]I think it feels natural to ask questions about what the other person has said just before in a normal chat.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I'm thinking it's necessary for a chat-like experience, but I'm not sure.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "experience"?
If the [nishio.icon]computer remembers all statements equally, it will often rehash very old stories as the dialogue gets longer.
[nisbot.icon]What "statement" is that "statement"?
[nishio.icon]The human input.
[nisbot.icon]
 > If the computer remembers all statements equally, the longer the dialogue goes on, the more likely it is to rehash very old stories.
 Is there anything else about this "statement"?
[nishio.icon]Human memory is so inferior to the computer that it's like, "What? What are we talking about?" and you feel like you've lost your back.
[nisbot.icon]
 > If the computer remembers all statements equally, the longer the dialogue goes on, the more likely it is to rehash very old stories.
 Where is this "statement"?
[nishio.icon]Computers have it in an indelible form in memory, but the human brain has less short-term memory.
[nisbot.icon]
 > If the computer remembers all statements equally, the longer the dialogue goes on, the more likely it is to rehash very old stories.
 Where is this "statement"?
[nishio.icon]For humans, you might have to look back at the logs to figure it out.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Computers have it in an indelible form in memory, but the human brain has little short-term memory.
 What kind of "computer" is this "computer"?
[nishio.icon]It has a more solid memory than humans. So I dare to design it so that the memory of the past fades away in accordance with humans. I've made a note of this before, but haven't started. Because the last minute boost was enough for practical use.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Human beings should be able to produce intellectually without stress.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "human" is that "human"?
[nishio.icon]I guess it's the subject of intellectual production. Answering questions brings out what has not yet been verbalized.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Human beings should be able to produce intellectually without stress.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "human being"?
[nishio.icon]Weak memory.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Human beings should be able to produce intellectually without stress.
 How do you know this "human being"?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > Human beings should be able to produce intellectually without stress.
 What does this "human" look like?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > Human beings should be able to produce intellectually without stress.
 What would you like to see happen regarding this "human"?
[nishio.icon]It's good to have stationery that allows for stress-free intellectual production.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "human" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]First there is stationery, then the human side needs to know it and learn how to use it.
[nisbot.icon]Can you do that with respect to "human beings"?
[nishio.icon]If you see the benefit in learning.
[nisbot.icon]
 > First there is stationery, then the human side needs to know it and learn how to use it.
 Where do these "humans" come from?
[nishio.icon]🙁

 How do you know this "statement"?
[nishio.icon]It was rehashed exactly now. I saw the computer quoted and remembered that we had talked about that.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "computer"?
[nishio.icon]Not particularly 🙁 .
[nisbot.icon]
 > I was rehashed exactly now. I see the computer quoted me and I remember that we talked about that.
 Where do these "computers" come from?

impressions
　unexciting
　Is this because I know too much about the inner workings?
　　I'd like to have 100 people who don't know anything about it talk to one side with boosting and one side without boosting and compare the excitement.
　Conversation Features
　　For a new word, "What X is it?" and then, usually immediately after, "What else do you have?" is on.
　　The cumulative score (the value indicating the keywords to dig into) doesn't change much from one statement to the next.
