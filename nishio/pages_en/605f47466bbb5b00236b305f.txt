Online get-together in unconference format
>You can use [HackMD] to introduce yourself and decide on topics. (Google Docs is often buggy these days when writing with many people, and Scrapbox requires an account, but HackMD can be shared with just a URL)

>[Online get-togethers] are difficult (and even offline are difficult on a large scale). My personal best practice is to do it [unconference style].

>I had just developed a best practice in online drinking, called unconference drinking (I tried it the other day and it was a success), and I was going to spread the word, but the advent of clubhouse has rendered it useless, angel smile

>I think that unconference drinking sessions, which I have wanted to do for a long time but have not yet done, would be a good match for online drinking sessions. It is a little difficult to talk without a theme when online (someone in a facilitator role is needed), so it is better to decide on a theme or something.

>I want to talk about various things with various people, but when we just get together and have a drink, we usually end up talking about what's going on and rarely get into deep discussions.
> This format would definitely be better for large get-togethers at academic conferences and the like. Currently, the only thing you can do is meet people you know and have them introduce you to new people they know.
> I think it's time to get rid of get-togethers that don't have a mechanism to facilitate getting to know each other.
> At ordinary drinking parties, it is difficult to talk about the future or visions because it is embarrassing to start a conversation, but when the theme is fixed, it becomes easier to talk about such things.
