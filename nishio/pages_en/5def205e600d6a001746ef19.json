	Groups do not open and close when tapped in lasso mode
		Hmmm, when you click without selection in selection mode, you can determine that, but you can't do a simple transfer like just calling onclick in the default tool.
  The default tool's side has a state at the mouse-down stage.
 Paper.js, the system is supposed to switch between tool objects and send mouse events to the currently selected tool, but this is not a good abstraction
  Users zoom and click without regard to whether they're in lasso mode or pen mode.
  The mode is only a value to be used as a reference, it is not reasonable to make it tightly coupled with the divisional unit of processing.
	â†’After the [copy and paste] discussion, I felt that clicking in lasso mode should bring up a balloon menu for pasting.
		So cancel this task.
