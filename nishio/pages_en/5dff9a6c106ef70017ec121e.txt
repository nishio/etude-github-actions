I want to program with a JIS keyboard and thumb shift, but I want to program with a US keyboard.

It's confusing to shift the home position in Japanese input mode but not in English input mode.
And by the way, I made JIS keys for thumb shift, but I really prefer US keys.
So I used Lacaille to achieve a displaced form in the US sequence.

As a preliminary step, Karabiner is shifting so numbers and symbols behave differently in English mode.
