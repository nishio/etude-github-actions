　Thoughts.
　　Count the number of pairs that cannot go back and forth.
　　[Subtracting the extra event].
　　　Islands that can come and go = connected
　　　If the size of the connected component is known [triangular number].
　　The composition of increasing one edge at a time when considering [time axis reversal].
　　Should I use [UnionFind] to find the connected components?
　　The process of finding the size of the connected component will not be completed in time if the root of each vertex is checked, so it is necessary to have the size in the form of root→size.
　公式解説
　　OK
　　UnionFind says size is O(1), but doesn't that mean it's implemented that way?
