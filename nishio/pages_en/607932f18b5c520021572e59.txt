âœ…Toggle between overall zoom and full-size view with the space key
Toggle between overall zoom and cursor position full size with ðŸ¤”space key
	I was assuming a full-size display of the mouse cursor position, but since it's a keyboard event, I don't have the coordinates.
	ã€€To begin with, the premise is "move the mouse cursor to where you want to pay attention," but is that easy to do when you're operating with a keyboard?
	Once I have the full size display in the center of the screen, I'll think about using it.

Try it.
ã€€When I want to pay attention to something, it's a hassle to move the cursor to it and then space it out.
ã€€Expansion with the space key is still a good mouse cursor position.
ã€€It was much more convenient to zoom to the mouse cursor position.

PS
ã€€I'm zooming so that the cursor position is centered, but maybe it would be more natural to zoom so that the cursor position is preserved?
