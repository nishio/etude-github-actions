Words are not equal in meaning.
The [meaning] of a word X when used is [different for different people].
	I have often experienced as an observational fact [a series of pictures of two people saying different things].
	Assuming that they're different, for most homo sapiens, communication becomes a high-stakes task that's beyond their control.
	So it assumes as a working hypothesis that the meanings of the words are equal, even though it is clear from the observed facts that this is an incorrect assumption.
　[story of your life (spoiler alert)]
　　A [non-homo sapiens intelligence] might be using a language system that does not make this ludicrous assumption.
　　From their point of view, it looks like "you are making strange assumptions without acknowledging them when they are obvious from the facts of observation.

What language system is such a language system?
　For example, "some X and some Y initially appear to be in conflict, but then some Z appears, and it is better than either."

　The composition "XYZ" can be shared even with a partner who has a different concrete XYZ
　　In fact, I'm using variables as placeholders rather than concrete ones in the example here.
　　Even if no word is assigned to this composition, it can be used by analogy.

　　[unnamed function]`lambda x, y: x + y` can be used without a name and without concrete x and y values
