>Most [jazz] performances are made up of interplay. But when the interplay is particularly noticeable in a performance, it is called "great interplay," etc. [src http://modernjazznavigator.a.la9.jp/glos/inter2.htm]

>I thought it was A stimulating B to [bring out] something in B[/villagepump/issac.icon].
