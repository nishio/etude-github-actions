Ideas are first generated by you.
All "multi-person idea generation" methodologies naturally have "the cost of convincing everyone that it's beneficial to do it" and "the cost of educating everyone on how to do it," but many people don't take this into account.

So, I first master the art of coming up with ideas myself.
Next, master the art of eliciting ideas from others.
It is a long way to go if you start by making others learn something.
