NFT is a lottery
This is probably the easiest and truest explanation

[NFT] is [lottery].
　There are people who bought NFT and gained in price, True
　 There are people who bought lottery tickets and won, True.
　Buy NFT and the majority of cases will not increase in value, True
　 Buying lottery tickets and most lotteries do not win, True
　The expected value of lottery profits is negative, True
 　NFT's expected gain in value is negative (in the long run)
 　　It's a [zero-sum game], and you're distributing the money that somebody put in, so the more people who are withdrawing, the more negative it is, True.
　If you don't buy a lottery ticket, you will never win the lottery, True
　 If you don't buy NFTs, you don't get a price gain on NFTs, True
　Lottery issuers can profit with no risk, True
　　NFT issuers can profit with no risk, True

When I mentioned this to my wife, she pointed out that "[NFT is a horse race]" is closer to "NFT is a horse race" when you take into account the fact that purchases are made for the purpose of "supporting a guesser".
