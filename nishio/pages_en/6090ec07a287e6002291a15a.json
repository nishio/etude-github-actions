 *1299713503*Mac (Snow Leopard) stuck in doing eTax.
 This is the first time I did eTax, and a friend of mine was stuck in the same situation, so here's a brief summary
 
 - Safari must be launched in 32-bit. Right-click on the application's icon to display "Information" and change it.
 - Be careful when handling the card, as the password for a residence card or digital certificate can be locked after 3 to 5 mistakes. Sometimes the keychain asks for the password. I had to go to the ward office to unlock my Mac with the administrator password by mistake.
 - For some reason, when I got an error in recognizing the card, I rebooted it anyway and it fixed it!
