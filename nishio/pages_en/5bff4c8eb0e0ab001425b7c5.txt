platformer
	Someone says, "Platforms are strong, so let's build a platform."
	An [abstract layer] that is disseminated by a strong company using its strength is called a [platform] [after the fact].
 	I originally wrote "when a strong company takes advantage of its strength to [enclose]," but I am not sure if enclosure is a necessary condition.
		If there are no factors restricting exit (no fences in enclosures), but something overwhelmingly useful is offered at a low price, there will be no new entrants to it, so there will be no place to move to after exiting.
  It is like a standard long-selling product.
