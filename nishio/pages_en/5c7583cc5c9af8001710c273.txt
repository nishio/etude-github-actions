Explaining Business Strategies in Mahjong
Compare to Mahjong about strategy in the presence of uncertainty.

Bad example

	They choose strategy X because other companies choose strategy X.
		When a player tries to make a tan yao when everyone around him or her makes a tan yao and he or she cuts many yao chu tiles.

	Avoids making decisions related to competition because he does not like himself to participate in competition
	ã€€He says he hates himself playing Mahjong while playing Mahjong, and then he closes his eyes and cuts the Tsumo.

	We believe that we should aim for maximum success, even if the probability is low.
		Aiming to win the Kokushimuso in every game.

	Dissatisfied that the method with the highest probability of success was not successful
		Complain about those who went up first, under the mysterious misconception that you can go up with a pinfu if you aim for a pinfu.

	They don't understand the rules, they violate the rules, and they get stuck in the middle.
		Riichi without tempei

	You won't be able to procure funds by adopting strange capital policies without thinking about the future.
		If you ring when you can, you can't get out of the game because you don't have a role.

	Unable to procure the resources necessary to do the business you are targeting
		I'm trying to get a single stroke, but there are four cards on the river.

Decent example
I was going to write "good example," but I just take things for granted.

	Decide which hand to aim for by looking at your tiles.
		Look at the resources within your company and decide on a strategy.

	Change your strategy based on the situation in the field.
		Change your strategy by looking at the external environment.
