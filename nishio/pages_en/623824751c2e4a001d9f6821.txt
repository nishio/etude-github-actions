I play Dominion in a Factorio way.
I seem to be
In Factorio-type games, it is similar to "increasing the efficiency of acquiring the resources needed to fulfill the game's win condition".
In Dominion, I also noticed that the way I play the game is to "increase the efficiency of acquiring the knowledge needed to win the game".

	I found that after three weeks of intensive study of [Dominion], my sane working friends would feel like they couldn't keep up if they advanced at such a speed, so I need to release my energy in some other direction. w
	The other day we were chatting about Dominion and I said, "How can I become more efficient and stronger?" to which he responded, "How can you ask for efficiency in a game?
	I was too surprised to catch what they said, but when I think about it, this seems to be some interesting cognitive difference.
	For example, when reading a mystery novel, in order to efficiently know the culprit, you should read from the back of the book, but many people do not do so. The reason for this is that the goal is not "to know the murderer," but rather "the process of knowing the murderer.
	[Factorio]-type games, for example, where you need to make 10,000 white cubes to clear the game.
	 The player does not want a white cube at this time.
	 This white cube analogy comes from the [Dyson Sphere Program].
	In fact, clearing the game itself is not the objective either. For example, if there was a button that, when pressed, would immediately clear the game, would you press it or not?
		Well, maybe people who prefer to play Factorio-type games are in the minority among homosapiens.
		If you put random homo sapiens in a cage and say, "You can't get out until you clear Factorio, and I'll let you out if you pay me 10,000 yen," there are going to be a good number of people who will pay 10,000 yen.
	To return to the point, players who like to play Factorio-type games see the value in "it takes 100 hours to collect a white cube if you do it inefficiently, but you can get it in 10 hours by spending one hour to create an efficient pipeline.
	So, there are many other objectives besides the one given as a condition for winning the game, and it depends on which one you find valuable.
	Dominion needs "knowledge" to win, which corresponds to the white cube.
		And some people say "just play a lot" as a way to acquire this knowledge, but this is "how to make a white cube that takes 100 hours".
		So I am trying to build a method to acquire knowledge in a shorter period of time, which can be interpreted as
