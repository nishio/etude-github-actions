preorder
[Semi-order] with [antisymmetry] removed

>Usually, economics and game theory assume that preferences are pre-ordered - [Game Theory [3rd ed.]
The relation a=b, in which the elements a and b are identical, and the similarly preferred relation a~b are different, and the former is derived a posteriori from the relation given and the latter is pre-ordered
	The two relationships don't necessarily coincide, allowing for the lack of coincidence is pre-order, and requiring coincidence is [semi-order].
	It is easy to forget that there are two different relationships and confuse them because they are often represented by the same symbol when they match
