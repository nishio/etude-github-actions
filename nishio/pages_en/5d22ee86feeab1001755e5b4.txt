		Ordinary things don't need to stand out.
			Spinner in storage
 		mark indicating a saved item is complete
 	Anything out of the ordinary should stand out.
			off-line mode
			Failed to save = unsaved changes are local
				Would be nice to see unsaved changes...

	event
		Can be edited offline (saved on the server when you come back online)
 	I'll edit things offline.
 	A bug in the drawing left me with stickies that wouldn't disappear.
 	Unintentionally reload the browser
 	Ah!
	Should have a [possible "may lose" alert if there are unsaved changes
 The latest status should be saved in localStorage in case of browser crashes, etc.
 	If I'm editing offline and trying to connect to the internet later, the power might go out.
 Next time you load, you should compare the data on the server with the local data and ask in a dialog, "The local data is newer, which one do you want to adopt?
