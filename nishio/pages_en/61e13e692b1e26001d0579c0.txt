I don't understand it when I look at the spatial arrangement of the sticky notes.
When I show them the KJ method or Kozaneba's [spatial arrangement], they often say, "I don't understand.
　It's no surprise that spatial arrangement is not a format for communicating information to others, making it difficult to understand.
　KJ method is also used to make a final written or oral presentation [one dimensional text].

　How well can others read the meaning from the spatial arrangement?
　　This is influenced by the degree to which the individual is accustomed to seeing information representations in the "two-dimensional arrangement" format
　　It's similar to someone who isn't used to reading a comic book that is divided into panels and doesn't know how to read it.
　　Similar to [literacy] in the sense that it is a trainable skill, and without that skill, the input efficiency of information expressed in that format is reduced.
