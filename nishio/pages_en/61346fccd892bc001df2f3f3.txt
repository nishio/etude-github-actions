Both the dropper and hopper run on one tick.
Some sites state that "it moves 2 ticks after the signal comes in," but this is contrary to the facts observed in BE1.17.11.
　Droppers send items in one tick.

	　I only turned on one tick and made sure the item moved to the next hopper.
	Hopper sucks items in one tick.

　　I put the item in the hopper with no destination on the top and turned on the hopper on the bottom for one tick and confirmed that the item moved down
　Hopper sucks ignoring the feed invalidation time of the upper hopper.

　　　The first tick put the item in the top hopper and the second tick turned on the bottom hopper.
　　　I confirmed that the item moves down on the second tick.
　　　　There must be a counter inside that counts the "number of ticks since the item was entered" because the sending out does not occur until 4 ticks later, but it is clear that the target counter value does not care when the item is sucked out
　　You can see that the hoppers are transported faster when lined up vertically than when lined up horizontally.
