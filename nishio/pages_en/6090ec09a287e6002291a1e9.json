 *1325503248*Page breaks using raw directives in Sphinx
 When I use Sphinx to write a book manuscript, for example, I have a need to have page breaks before section headings. In my case, I print out the HTML and take it with me only when I go out to review it, so by embedding a tag with the page-break-after: always style in the raw directive where I want the page break, I can make a page break at the page break is now performed at the specified position when printed as expected.
 
 >||
 .. raw:: html
 
    <p style="page-break-after: always" />
 ||<
 
 Although I achieved my goal for the time being, I don't like to have such a thing buried in the manuscript (and it would give me a shock when I hand it to an editor who is not familiar with reST), so it would be nice if Sphinx could add "style="page-break-before: always" to all h2 tags except the first one. I wish I could add "style="page-break-before: always" to h2 tags except for the first time" or something like that.

 The unique atmosphere of Mamoru Oshii's Urusei Yatsura and WALL-E's "science fiction" style in which neither the hero nor heroine speaks a language greatly surprised me, and I enjoyed it.
 
 *1325516319*Tempur triangle cushion experience
 My wife gave me a Tempur triangle seat cushion (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0019M1JOO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22& linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B0019M1JOO">Tempur(R) PC seat cushion</a>) for me and I use it happily.
 
 This is what it looks like at my desk at work.

 At home, I mix it between sitting on the floor and pulling it on the floor as I see fit. This is because I have a hot carpet underneath and sometimes I want to warm up.

 My chair at work is an Aeron chair for backward leaning posture and my chair at home is a Varier Balans(<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=varier+balans&hl=en&safe=off&prmd=imvns&source= lnms&tbm=isch&ei=I8gBT-i-NcXWmAX-qPC2DQ&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&cd=2&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1189&BIH=579'>image search</a>) without a backrest. I'm a forward leaner, so I had a bit of a posture mismatch and felt tired on the backs of my knees and calves. I was wondering if pulling out this cushion would improve it a lot. I've only used it for one day at work, so I'm not sure about the compatibility with the Aeron chair, but when I use it at home when I work on the hot carpet, it seems to put less stress on my lower back because my pelvis stands up compared to sitting directly on the floor.
