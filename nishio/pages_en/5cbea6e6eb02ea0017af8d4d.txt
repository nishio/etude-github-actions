	[Social construction] of [knowledge] and [understanding]
	context
		The child has a naive theory.
		Highly abstract scientific concepts are not directly experienced by children.
			An object will move with constant velocity if no force is applied to it."
				What we actually observe is, "If you throw a ball, it will bend and fly," and "A ball you roll will eventually stop."
				Because the situation of "no force being applied to an object" is rare.
		When teachers give "clear explanations" in school, "[bubble-type understanding]" occurs.
			It is the only independent, empirically unconnected understanding.
			This kind of knowledge disappears quickly.
		These scientific concepts are "socially constructed" through discussions, hypotheses, and experiments.
			This "social construction" is done through "[dialogue]" in the learning environment
			This is the "model of learning" that this book conveys
