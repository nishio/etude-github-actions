media art
There was a case of interpreting media art as somehow "something like electronics," and I was like, no, no, no, it's not the same thing.

Just as [new art] (Art Nouveau) was created in the early 20th century using "new technologies of the time," media art ([New media art https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art]) was created in the mid-20th century using then new technologies, such as video and television, were used to create it. Wolf Vostell's work from 1958 [http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/deutscher-ausblick/] is considered to be the first work to use television.

Viewed on a timescale of about 100 years, from 1950 to 2050, the term "media art" started out as a visual media, but soon became an umbrella term for "new art that incorporates new technological fields. Since there is no clear categorization consensus for newly emerging fields, existing terms are often stretched.

Perhaps 100 years from now, people will look back and say, "At that time, it was called media art all together, but what was popular at that time was video art, and what was popular at that time was Internet art," and classify it after the fact.
