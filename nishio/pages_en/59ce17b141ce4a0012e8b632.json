Customers talk about methods, not objectives.
	Say "what X" the customer wants you to do.
 But if you look closely, it is not [the objective] but [the method
 Customers are not properly [verbalizing] their objectives.
 What makes you happy about doing X?"
 What problem do you want to solve by doing X?"
 We need to get this out of them.
 Do not proceed with development while the method has become an objective.
