 I'm feeling less and less motivated because logging on my PC has become a chore. I started putting "Instant English Composition" English sentences instead of words on my word cards, and I guess that's one of the reasons why it's harder for me to pass the test. I think I am continuing to look over my word cards once a day, but I don't know if it is true or not because I don't keep track of it. Should I mark it in my notebook?
 
 The first problem is that it is difficult to log on a PC because I look through it on the train, and the second problem is that I procrastinate starting the project because of the difficulty in logging. The third problem is that I am simply too busy to take the time. When I think I want to improve this card, I don't have time to look it up in the English-English dictionary and add it to the card. I understand that I am not good at using my time. There is room for improvement.
