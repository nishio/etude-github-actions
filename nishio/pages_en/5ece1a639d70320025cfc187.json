Assumption of intent in statements
[statement] has [intent] [assumption].
	Some people make the unspoken assumption that statements made by others must be made with some kind of intention.
ã€€Such people read non-existent intentions such as "I am trying to get the person who created this situation to change his/her behavior" from the mere [information sharing] of "I (think) this situation is not good.

	There are those who believe that "everything should be open to the public except what we don't want to be seen."
	When such people observe the world and think, "I see, this is the structure of the world," they tend to write their "interpretation of the world" immediately.
	That's not to say that I expect anyone to change their behavior.
