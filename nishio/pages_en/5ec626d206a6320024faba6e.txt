>Humility You are not the center of the world. You are not omniscient, omnipotent, or absolutely right. Always try to improve yourself.
>Respect: Show genuine consideration for the people you work with. Treat them as human beings and appreciate their abilities and achievements.
>Trust: Trust that someone other than yourself is competent and will do the right thing. Then you can delegate work to someone other than yourself (but it is difficult to delegate to incompetent people).
