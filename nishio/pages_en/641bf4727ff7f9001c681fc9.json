Clarke's three laws
The following three laws defined by [science fiction author][Arthur C. Clarke].
	If [an eminent and senior scientist] says it is possible, the claim is almost certain. And if he says it is impossible, his assertion is first of all wrong.
		When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
	The only way to measure [the limits of possibility] is to challenge yourself until you transcend those limits just a little bit.
		The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
	[Sufficiently developed technology is indistinguishable from magic].
		Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
