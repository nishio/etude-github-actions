There is more than one person at the well to cut out.
from [/villagepump/ One of the reasons that the well is working so well is that there seems to be more than one person to cut out].

One of the reasons the well is working so well may be that there is more than one person to cut out[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
	Not dependent on any particular person.
	The cutting process itself is entertaining.
	　You say, "You're going to cut it out like that?" and then you add [glue][/villagepump/nishio.icon].
	　Is this some sort of [Cunningham's Law]? (I would make a correction about a cutout that I find difficult to understand)[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
	　 We've talked about the diary being the killer content for the well, and I think [the new pages that grow in the form of cutouts] are going to have a good effect.
	　 It's not so good when the diary just flows away.

				>The well-wisher's joint diary also gives the impression of flowing, but the best contents are cut out and become a page and stock information.
    > Is the good thing about a well co-diary that this can be done [seamlessly]?

I have the impression that it is only very recently that they are often cut out[/villagepump/takker.icon].
　At least in 2022 it wasn't that frequent.
　I think [bracketing] by [WikiGnome] was well done in 2022? [/villagepump/inajob.icon]
　 I have the impression that bracketing has been done since the early days[/villagepump/takker.icon].
　  I don't think there were too many people in the first phase, so it wasn't that bad.
