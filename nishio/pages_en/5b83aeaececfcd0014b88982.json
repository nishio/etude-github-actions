Sticky note too small issue
The problem of "[sticky note too small to write on]" when [writing method] on a small [sticky note] in the preparation stage of the KJ method.
 The information obtained by "exploring within yourself" is already stored within you, so just put the handle on the sticky note.
 In contrast, information obtained from "explorations outside yourself" (user interviews, reading, etc.) is not stored within you
 	I can't remember if I just put the handle on.
  So, as an alternative to memory, the desire to "make a note" at a level of detail that can be recalled occurs
  It's one thing to make detailed notes, it's another to make handles on them and write them on sticky notes.
  　It is not reasonable to put "information that should be properly recorded and retrievable in its original form later" on a sticky note.
  	Such things should be made into electronic data and searchable.
   Intellectual production techniques before computer dissemination should change to incorporate new technologies.
　Writing on a sticky note itself is probably "making a nameplate" or "summarizing" a huge amount of raw data.
 　On the other hand, it bothers me because people who are trying to learn will be confused if they're told they have to do that as a first step.

 It's like a Scrapbox page with detailed information, a summary, a nameplate, and a handle written as a title.
 What comes out of the internal exploration, conversely, is an image that corresponds to a line in Scrapbox
 I don't think every page in my current Scrapbox is appropriate as a sticky note.
 When you're using paper tools to write things out, there's a finite limit depending on the size of the paper, and that's not an option.
 　When I'm using digital tools to write things out, I don't want to use "this is too long, let's write it in Scrapbox first".
	Wouldn't you rather be able to write it in Scrapbox and import it?
