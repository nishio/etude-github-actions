 9 Habits to Stop Being Stuck Thinking About This and That
	[Hideki Wada]

	Interesting case study on p. 73 of one "former high-level bureaucrat famous for his ability to get the job done".
  Culture of training newcomers by making them work hard
  rush of work
   Work hard only on jobs that you are good at and from excellent and respected bosses.
   I'll get to other business later.
		A good boss will appreciate you more.
  People who have turned in work they don't want to do, or from bosses they don't appreciate.
  This is very similar to the [Motivation Creation Method], "[Choose for yourself what to do out of what you have to do]"


	What I thought as I read.
  [pre-loss and post-loss].
  [generally fail].
  [whether or not to rely on others].
		[The less confident you are, the more you speak ill of others.]
  [Negative critics]

	You want to do this or that, but you can't seem to take action because you are tired.

	Morita therapy
 	absolute bed rest
  	Forced rest for a week.
   	[Do "nothing"]
