Diversity and Servant Leadership
In managing a small team with high [diversity] and high individual skills, the leader has no choice but to do [servant leadership]. This is because the leader cannot exceed the skills of the members, and it is more efficient for the leader to create an environment in which members with better skills than his or her own can be comfortable and highly productive.
	Similar concept to Drucker's "[Experts cannot manage]".
	So far, I agree.

"If you're trying to do something with a large, low-skill, low-diversity team, you're going to have to [micromanage]." How about.
	If you want to move a less skilled person "the way you want", you need to give detailed instructions. OK here.
	Wouldn't it be better if you didn't try to move it the way you want it to move?
  More troublesome than low skills per se are "people with low [initiative]" who cannot move on their own without being told to do so.
 Isn't micromanagement not suitable for managing "many people" because it is labor intensive?

>If you try to manage a small, high-skill, high-diversity team, leadership has to be servant-like because it is impossible to surpass members in knowledge of all skills. If you try to do something with a high number of people, low skill, low diversity team, you will have to be imperative and micromanage.
>My view is that teal is not inherently good, but that if you try to build a productive team, you will be forced to manage teal as a result, and if you skim over the cause and effect, you will end up with chaos.
