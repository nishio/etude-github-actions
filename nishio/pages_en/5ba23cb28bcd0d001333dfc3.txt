Ctrl+T in the title section
	When I want to make a quick note in [Scrapbox], or when I can't think of a particular title
	I've been writing "Memo" or something appropriate in the title.
 I recently changed the format of the date and time inserted by Ctrl+T to my liking.

	If you can't think of a title, just use Ctrl+T.
 The fact that the title only mentions the date and time means that it is a note written on that date and time.
 If you come up with a title after writing the note, you can change it.
 Freedom from the pressure to "write the title."
