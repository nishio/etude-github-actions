How much would tokenize Scrapbox with [cl100k_base]?
	The original data is in this Scrapbox, page 14178.
　Less than 1% of the 8192 tokens do not fit
  OpenAI's [Embedding API] can take up to 8192 tokens, so most pages can be embedded in their entirety.
 Majority shorter than 500 tokens
 　I decided to separate only those longer than that into 500 tokens each.
