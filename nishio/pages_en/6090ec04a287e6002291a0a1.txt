 *1272336176* How to fit a MacBook keyboard.
 <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QhlpFIrIw0'>YouTube - How to re-assemble a Key on APPLE MACBOOK keyboard topcase</a>
 
 Oh, so that's how you do it! Thanks to that, the G key, which had not been put back together since it was disassembled and cleaned before, is now hooked up properly.
 
 Since I had been using Thinkpad for a long time, I thought I had to disassemble and clean the keyboard when it got dirty, and when I did the same with MacBook, I had a problem because the keyboard would not fit.

 A typical style is the "shabby clothes and cape" style. This style is characterized by a ragged school uniform, cape, torn school cap, high clogs, and a hand towel at the waist, etc. (omission) It is said to express the attitude of "pursuing the truth without being deceived by surface appearances. --- <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%90%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AB%E3%83%A9'>Bankara - Wikipedia</a>

 Oh, that's right. I'm the one who always wears similar clothes, and I'm a bunkara!
 
 *1272360425*[Emacs] How to close only open buffers that are under a specific directory.
 When developing several applications in parallel using the same framework, there are many files with the same name, and if you accidentally open the view.py of the next project without closing the view.py used in the project you were developing earlier, you will end up with a buffer named view.py<2>, and when you use C-x When I switch buffers with C-xb, I am disappointed when I see something different than what I expected.
 
 I'll look into how to work this out later. I'll put it down and see if anyone can tell me how to do it. Worst case scenario, I could do it by writing elisp. This time I closed everything manually.

 It was booklet style. Then I noticed that we don't have a stapler in our house. Really? But I can't find any.

 I made two sets. I'll be on a plane tomorrow for about 8 hours, so test play will be a lot easier.

 <body>It's not a radical solution, but how about installing uniquify.el first? <br>http://gist.github.com/380630</body>

 <body>I found this blog by chance. Bunkara, I like it! My high school was a private boys' high school in Kanagawa Prefecture, a DQN school with a bad reputation for bad behavior, and before the gymnastic festival, the first-year students were forced to sing the cheer song to the third-year students. It was the heyday of "bontan" and "nakaran," and seniors with punch perms and regent hair would come into the classroom with bamboo swords and suddenly smash the blackboard with them to get into the spirit. But this is not the same as Bankara.... The real BANKARA spirit is in Iwate Prefecture, where the costumes on wikipedia are a privilege reserved for the brilliant students of Iwate Prefecture's prestigious prefectural high schools. He was a bunkara player when he was in high school! He was a bunkara in his high school days! He would fry his school cap in a frying pan and wear it tattered on purpose, and wear geta (Japanese clogs) with bare feet in the heavy snow in winter to stay thin! Iwate Prefecture is the most admired, bunkara kingdom in Japan! If you sing "My Good Friend" by Hiroshi Kamayatsu at karaoke from No. 1 to No. 6, you will surely be able to see it! </body>
