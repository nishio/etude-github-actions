Goods are created by abstracting goods.
 Just as in the past, the image of physical commodities was abstracted to become "[goods]," and the image of concrete money was abstracted to become "[capital]," and concrete work became "the expanded reproduction of capital," the Ichiba, which exchanged money for goods, was abstracted to become "[market] (shijo). The market is a system that increases [liquidity].
 The word [system] is another abstraction that came about as a result of abstraction.
  In primitive times, most of them were non-combination objects such as "water" and "acorns." As civilization progressed, people began to create objects that functioned by combining elements, such as "stag" and "bow. 2000 years ago in Greece, vending machines were created. The Greek word "combination" is the origin of the word system.
 In abstracting physical objects into "goods," the ease of reproduction was discarded. This is because some physical objects are easy to reproduce and others are not.
  On the other hand, it has become known over the past 20 years that direct exchange of [easily duplicable] goods for money that cannot be duplicated is difficult, and monetization through an advertising model is now being considered.
  Monetization in the advertising model is a model in which, since a certain good is difficult to exchange directly for money, the good is exchanged for another good in the form of views by allowing people to use it free of charge, and money is earned by passing it on to the person who wants the views.
  Conversely, the subscription model reduces the ease of reproduction. If you don't keep paying, access rights are taken away.

補足
	Money has an aspect as capital as well as goods.
  The market is an exchange of goods for goods. It doesn't feel right to describe it as an "exchange of capital for goods."
  Money, as a good, is a special "thing" that cannot be duplicated but is extremely inexpensive to transport.
