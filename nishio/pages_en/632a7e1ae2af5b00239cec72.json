Avoid disappointing risks and live like a stranger.
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/60488305162207232?s=21&t=xAfnDP_xPg85aAyLqTv8Qw @nishio]: if you don't have [expectations], you won't be [disappointed], but if you don't have expectations, you won't create action. I'm not sure how to do this, but I'm not sure. [Which is a more enjoyable life: [avoiding the risk of disappointment] and not actively acting, [living your life as if your life is someone else's], or [actively acting] with the expectation of a good outcome and sometimes being disappointed? I prefer the latter.
