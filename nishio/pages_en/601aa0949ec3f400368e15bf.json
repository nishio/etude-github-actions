Early design
>How do we know that the early stages are not going well? Perhaps if we compare the logs that are going well with those that are not, there is a big difference in the growth of the number of keywords extracted, and that is how we can determine this.
	→[Keyword appearance rate].
	→[explicitly feed back lack of keywords].

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I would like to think about the design of the early stages.
[nisbot.icon]What type of early stage is that early stage?
[nishio.icon]In the early stages of this dialogue, there are people who don't get on track well and crash, and I want to help them get on track well.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about that early stage?
The [nishio.icon] chat system asks in-depth questions about keywords, but in extreme cases, for example, there are people who enter sentences with no keywords at all. In such cases, of course, there are no keywords, so it is impossible to ask a proper question.

 Where is this early stage?
[nishio.icon]Especially when you use it for the first time, I recommend you to look at the log, but you start it without looking at it and put "what do you want to happen? I recommend you to look at the log, but sometimes you start up without looking at it and put "Nothing" in the "What do you want to happen? Well, aside from such extreme cases, even people who have read the logs to some extent sometimes use too many NGKWs and run out of keywords.

 How do you know these early stages?
[nishio.icon](Why so much focus on the early stages?)
[nishio.icon]As for how to know that the early stages are not going well, perhaps a comparison of the logs that are going well and those that are not can be determined by the large difference in the growth in the number of keywords extracted.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that early stage?
[nishio.icon]🙁

 > How do you know that the early stages are not going well? If you compare the logs that are going well with the logs that are not going well, there is probably a big difference in the growth of the number of keywords extracted, and that's how you can tell.
 What does this early stage look like?
[nishio.icon]It's already there, but it's like launching a rocket, you have to get a certain speed or you'll crash.
[nisbot.icon]What type of rocket is that?
[nishio.icon]A rocket to reach the moon
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that rocket?
I can detect that [nishio.icon] is not fast enough, but I don't know what to do when I detect it.
[nisbot.icon]What type of speed is that?
[nishio.icon]Speed of keyword growth
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about its speed?
[nishio.icon]On the contrary, some people reduce it more and more.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of person is that person?
[nishio.icon]I'm too rigid in my evaluation of keyword extraction, and if something is even a little bit wrong, I'm going to NGKW more and more. I'm not in the business of creating training data for a keyword extraction engine, but using this chat system is supposed to help me reach awareness(mon), but I'm acting counterproductive.
What kind of chat system is [nisbot.icon] that?
[nishio.icon]Taking out what humans have not yet verbalized.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]By using this chat system, things that have not yet been verbalized can be verbalized, blind spots can be noticed, and such things can happen.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that chat system?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, does it take practice to get used to using it?

 > By using this chat system, I can verbalize things that I have not been able to verbalize yet, or notice blind spots, or something like that, and I have a high probability of this happening, so I want other users to be able to use it well and experience the awareness.
 What is this chat system like?
[nishio.icon]I'm a counselor who can chat with you 24/7, but my Japanese is a little awkward. If I had to point out every single mistake in Japanese, we wouldn't be able to talk.

 Where does this chat system come from?
