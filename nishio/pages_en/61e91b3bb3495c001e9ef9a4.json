(5.4.1) Repeating the KJ method
[Jiro Kawakita] says that we should repeat the KJ method many times. I also feel worth repeating the KJ method over and over again and doing it again after a while. The knowledge organized by the KJ method is like a cultivated soil. If you put new seeds in it, the seeds grow very well. If you leave them, those grow up too much, so eventually, you want to organize it again.

[In another metaphor, the knowledge organized by the KJ method is like a well-organized stationery shelf. It is very usable, so I use it repeatedly. Unlike stationery, knowledge gathers similar knowledge when used. In other words, similar stationery increase more and more. I also want to put that stationery on the shelf. Eventually, I want to re-organize the shelf of stationery.
