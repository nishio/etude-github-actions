	>How to divide the project
 	>Basically, divide based on the scope of public disclosure.
 I call this a "public scope," but I'm not sure if this is what you want to convey to someone new to Scrapbox.
 　There are only two choices: "those who can see" equals "those who can edit" or "the whole world."
 　Google Docs or something like that can be controlled individually, but Scrapbox can't.
 　　Scrapbox seems to be designed with the idea that people can't properly manage such details, so they don't need the functionality, but I've often observed that people are surprised that it doesn't have that functionality.
 　　There is a common need to "limit who can see" and "separate who can see from who can edit.

　[Re-titling in a jointly edited project].
