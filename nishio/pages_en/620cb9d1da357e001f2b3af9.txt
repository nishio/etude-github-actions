Is it necessary?
Do you need it?" With regard to the question [if you are not sure you need it, you don't need it], I am interested in why you don't come to that conclusion.

Someone says, "I need X," and you feel, "I don't seem to need X," but you don't feel confident in that judgment?

Are we so accustomed to being told we "need" to do things we don't really understand the necessity of through schooling or other means that we feel compelled to do them when others tell us we need to do them?

　　When you say, "Is it necessary?" that's not necessary because there's "no clear reason to think it's necessary."
　　Do it when the need becomes apparent, which is [(1.3.1.1) Delayed Evaluation Study Method].
