　1 is greater than 0, but less than 100.
　　From the perspective of 100, it's silly to compare 0 and 1 and argue that they are bigger or smaller.

Original post.
	There are strategies A, B, and C with expected returns of 0, 1, and 100
	What people taking Strategy C feel.
		B is futile, should take C
	What people who stay in A feel
		Not realizing B or C returns.
		Investments to get B and C returns appear large relative to returns.
		So I choose A.
	What it feels like to stay in B
	　Not realizing the return of C
	　Affirms the current strategy by feeling that "the return on B is greater than on A."
	What people who have experienced "A to B to C" feel
		B is better than A.
		You can't go to C in one step, you have to do B first ([overgeneralization of my experience]).
