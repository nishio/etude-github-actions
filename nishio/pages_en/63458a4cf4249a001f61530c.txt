I don't know how to upload files to Google Colab...
　I dropped it where I could drag-drop it.
　What's with the circle that shows up and then turns into a cross when I hover over it?
 I thought it was just that the file was too big to show the progress.

I dragged and dropped a small file and it uploaded.
　But an error not found in the code, what does it mean?
　And it doesn't show up in the file list when I makedirs from Code?
　But then I thought, this was cd'd with the code I based it on.

It began to move!

It worked on the small sample data, but the important large file was not uploaded yet.

　　hmm


Huh? It worked once and then it stopped working?

	Google Colab nothing is known.
	It seems like CUDA is telling me that there is not enough memory, so I guess it means that something generated in the first run was not GC'd and they tried to create something new and had room to create one, but not two.

I tried restart runtime.
　I thought the module I installed was no longer available, so I thought the uploaded file was also no longer available, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
　I'm guessing the installed modules are placed outside of the mounted Google Drive, so they'll disappear after a restart of the runtime.
　It's moving safely. Yay!

　This means that the problem of runtime disconnection when left unattended is also solved. The results of the process are saved in Google Drive as needed, so even if it is disconnected after the process is finished, it won't be much of a problem even if it is interrupted in the middle of the process.
　We're happy, we're satisfied. Let's take a bath and go to bed.

An experiment to make a tasteless technical diary more readable by adding illustrations with [NovelAIDiffusion].

>I'm saving the results of the process to Google Drive as needed.
	It was a lie.
	[https://gyazo.com/a7631c20cdaec09735fc06f3c497ed56]
　Explicitly had to mount Google Drive and write the results there
　So there are three ways.
　　Where it disappears after restarting the runtime.
　　Reboot and it doesn't go away but "disconnected from session"? Where it disappears after being
　　Google Drive, not disappearing.


That's roughly 8 seconds to convert one image to a prompt.

Went to bed, woke up, did it right.
　The number of images with ready-to-publish status increased from 956 to 1426.
code::
 0: total generated 39298
 1: new, not reviewed 14666
 2: marked as not good 22712
 2: marked as good 1913
 3: done CAP-tan 1425
 4: wait INS-tan 482
 4: done INS-tan 943
The number of one case does not match.

Well, there are some details that have been omitted, but here's a rough idea.
　The insta post buffer was about to be empty, so I added it, now there are 482 posts, so 10 days worth.
　There are 15,000 that haven't been reviewed yet.

Transcribe low priority things here.
　Allow inpaint code to be merged and automatically generated
　　Do you want to?
　　Maybe you're better suited to do it in a mode where you can stop the automatic generation and have an immediate response.
　Mode to keep prompt on img2img
　　I'm shaking the prompts randomly now, too.
　Make a short video of your Insta ranking?
　Make the top 100 insta-rankings?
