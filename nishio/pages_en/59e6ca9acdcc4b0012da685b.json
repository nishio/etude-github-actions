Flyer Creation Experience
	I want to make an explanatory flyer for the Unexplored Association before the Unexplored Junior Achievement Report Meeting in 12 days.
 2017-10-10
  Ask the designer to prepare a manuscript for printing with a deadline of Monday the 16th.
 Monday, 2017-10-16, manuscript DONE from designer.
  15:41 Order & credit card payment done at [LUXUR https://raksul.com/
   Color on both sides, 90kg glossy paper, 200 copies, 3,100 yen
  15:43 Data submission (PDF)done
   >Customers have selected "No PDF confirmation". If there are any defects in the printed data as a result of the check, we will send you a confirmation e-mail even if you have selected "No PDF confirmation".

 		>[IMPORTANT] Please confirm the results of the data check of the flyer/flyer.
   Point out that the PDF contains colors that cannot be printed (maybe RGB instead of CMYK, or something like that).
   I was informed that "the color may look a little different," but I can't tell the difference by looking at the PDF, so I went through with it.
   I forgot to record what time I responded.

  	>October 17 is the confirmed date for acceptance of flyer and flyer printing
   >The shipment of products will be made within 1 day from the day after the date of confirmation of receipt.
   >It usually takes about 1-3 business days from the time of shipment to receive your product.
   The email says the data check completion date is the 16th, so I'm guessing the 12 hour gap here means it's not running at night.

 	It arrived when I got home.
  There was a thin white area at the edge of the solid paint up to the edge.
  	Probably needs to be painted over when creating the original data

 very day
  After placing the flyers side by side with various flyers made by other publishers, we found that paper quality affects the sense of quality considerably.
  Maybe a little better paper than the default would be better.
 The PDF of the manuscript should be put up on the web so that it can be mentioned by URL when you want to explain the unexplored corridor.

 Version 2
  2018-02-23(Fri) Manuscript DONE from designer.
   0:20 Order and data submission (AI)done at LUXURU
   	Since we had informed the designer that we would be printing with LUXURUS this time, we received the manuscript in AI using the LUXURUS template.
    A4 double-sided color glossy paper (coated), slightly thick: 110kg
    10,100 for a plan of 500 copies, 1 business day from receipt, 10,908 yen including tax
    Extending the deadline would reduce the price to about half, but it's not good for mental health.
    Again, we'll do it in one business day and gather data on how long it takes to get here.
    Select speed submission, and check to see if there are any tonboards, etc., on your own.
    	I don't know if it was like this when I did it before.

   It came out significantly faster than last time, because last time it went through a human check?
