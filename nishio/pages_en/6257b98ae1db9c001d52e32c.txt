Parable of the grumpy toddler who doesn't get attention.
An only child toddler usually gets a lot of attention from his parents, and when he goes to a family gathering or something, he expects that the other adults should naturally pay attention to him, but the adults leave him alone and talk among themselves, which makes him uncomfortable.
