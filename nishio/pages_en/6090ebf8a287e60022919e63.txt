 You think you don't have time for many things and can't write a blog, but it's already been 110 minutes since you returned at 24:00. You can write.
 
 I heard that <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/">ICFP Programming Contest 2008</a> does not require students, does not require teams, and has 72 hours. I don't know much about it, but I'm interested.
