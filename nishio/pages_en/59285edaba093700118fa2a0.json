The conflict between the idea that "two things are in conflict" and the idea that "there is one thing" is resolved [dialectic] by considering that there are two [extensions] of the one thing.

[Spinoza] synthesized the idea that there is a conflict between spirit and matter and the idea that there is only one God with the idea that both matter and spirit are extensions of God.
