Technology that doesn't age is beneficial for intellectual productivity in life as a whole.
Why study old people?
　Thinking about it again, I realized that this is part of intellectual productivity improvement.
　Miscellaneously grouped by age
　　In the 20s, the focus was on improving productivity through programming language and tool selection.
　　　This is about gaining knowledge for choice
　　In the 30s, the focus shifted to productivity gains related to "gaining knowledge."
　　　What to learn
　　　How to connect what you learn to value
　　　How to structure the acquisition of "knowledge that is easy to connect to value" without trying too hard
　　In my 40s, I am acutely aware of the fact that my cognitive abilities are declining.
　　　Some people begin to engage in harmful behaviors due to cognitive decline.
　　　If intellectual production is measured by its contribution to society, it is important for me not to be a person who does harm at the end of my life in order to improve my overall intellectual productivity
