 *1193192835*how to write org.
 I'm not sure if it's because of the test I did just before I realized that it failed yesterday to see how many simultaneous connections I could make to Apache, or if there's something wrong with the auto-submit function for the subject, or...
 
 But it's hard to imagine that a web app written in Django would prevent me from logging in to the server.
 
 *1193195978* Weirdo is looking at me.
 
 I thought it was a mannequin.
 
 *1193242067* I'm home.
 
 I'm back from a group company get-together. To be precise, from the after-party. Thank you for the food.
 
 I mean, I couldn't drink a drop of alcohol because I was selected as a Wii player! I'll drink! I'll drink! I'll drink! I'll drink anything! (abbreviation below)

 Q: A Cybozu business card has a picture on the back in four sections, and the picture is completed when all four cards are matched. If you receive a business card at random, how many cards will complete the picture? Find the average.
 
 The picture is divided into 1 division, 1, 2, 3, so 6 for 3, 10 for 4, etc. There is not much information about what the right column of 1, 3, and so on will be next, but if you say it will be 9, you are arguing that it is of exponential order, 27 for 4, 81 for 5, and so on. If you say that this is the order of the exponent, then it is an assertion that the number of rows increases. On the other hand, the claim that the next number after 1 and 3 is 5 is 7 when divided into 4, 9 when divided into 5, and 201 million when divided into 101 million. Well, I don't know the answer to this question without proper calculation, but I think that an average of 10 pieces for 4 divisions is a reasonable line. I will solve the problem tomorrow or later when I am sober and in a better mood.

 When I solved it correctly, it was O(nlogn), not O(n^2). The correct answer is 8.33.
