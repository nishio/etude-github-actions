You forget more than you realize.
People [forget] many things, but in normal life, we only [realize] that we are forgetting when we try to remember something and cannot remember it. When I use [Scrapbox], I am told, "I already wrote that in the past," and it becomes possible to observe that I have forgotten more than I was aware of before.
