People who don't look at the moon through a telescope.
The invention of the telescope enhanced one of man's cognitive abilities, human vision.
When you look at the moon with it, you can recognize that it's bumpy.
There were people who abstained from looking at the moon through a telescope because this was contrary to their beliefs at the moment.

I don't want to be that person.

[Avoidance of opportunities for observation contrary to belief].
