POST JSON with requestss
code:python
 payload = {"q": sample_text}
 r = requests.post(API_URL, json=payload)
The above code is fine.
　The following works as well. I use it a lot, so there's a shortcut provided.
　I thought I would need to encode the string since it contains Japanese characters, but that is done internally when converting it to JSON, so I don't need to do it myself.
　　Rather, if you do it, you get `TypeError: Object of type bytes is not JSON serializable` because bytes is not JSON compatible.

code:python
 payload = json.dumps({"q": sample_text})
 headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}
 r = requests.post(API_URL, data=payload, headers=headers)
