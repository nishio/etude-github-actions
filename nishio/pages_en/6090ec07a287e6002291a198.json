 I bought a TRAVELER'S notebook. I used to use a super-organized notebook, and the reason why I chose it was that it could fit A4 when folded into four, but after that I stopped carrying it around because it was too long and unbalanced when I put it in my pocket, and when I didn't carry it around, it was too thin and delicate to use.
 
 I've been on the task of writing down what I ate and my weight for two days, and I'm aiming to continue for a week.
