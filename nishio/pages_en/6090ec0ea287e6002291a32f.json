 *1437545610*Speaking at the Unexplored Research Group Kickoff
 He will speak at the "Unexplored Research Group Kickoff" on August 4 at 6:00 p.m. at the Daibiru 5F Exchange Facility in Akihabara.
 
 The General Incorporated Association MUTOH is trying to create a place for creative talents inside and outside of MUTOH to gather and interact in the form of "Working Groups" of "Research Groups". Henry Ford said, "Gathering is the first step, staying together is progress, and working together is success.
 
 The schedule includes a talk by Mr. Koike of the 2010 SC about the Entrepreneurship Working Group, a talk by Mr. Ukai of the 2011 SC about the Programming Education Working Group, and a talk by Mr. Takeuchi about "the kind of seed that makes everyone say wahaha after Mr. Ukai's talk". I will talk about how the activities of the "Productivity Improvement Working Group" can lead to "real benefits" in the form of increased productivity for everyone!
 
 I really like the expression "seed" by Mr. Takeuchi. I feel that we are going to grow from here. The Unexplored Research Group Kick-Off is a place for people who are interested in this kind of activity to gather and take the "first step". Please join us!
