Hides the gate, but shows the brilliance inside the fence.
I wonder if this is a good way to operate to create a community that produces something useful.

Or the low resolution of "Splendor in the Fence."
　Is it "fun" or "smell of money"?
　　Sending out "interestingness" is beneficial to the community because it attracts people who find the same things interesting.
　　Sending out "[the smell of money]" is detrimental because it brings in money seekers and diminishes community resources.
　In other words, I'd rather have people think, "Someone is fun-driven and putting their time into something that doesn't even make money," and then when the smell of money leaks out, they can't get in anymore.

　After all these years, I thought the term "smell of money" seemed a little too peculiar.
　I think "usefulness" is about right.
