A quick summary of books on the KJ method
 [party studies] The Law of Developing Human Creativity (Shakai Shiso Sha, Gendai Sentaku Bunko, 1964)
 [Ideas] For Creativity Development (Chuko Shinsho 1967, revised 2017, Chuko Bunko 1984)
 [The development and application of the KJ method (Chuko Shinsho, 1970)
 [From research to creation (Kodansha Gendai Shinsho, 1977)
 [KJ method: Let the chaos speak for itself] (1986, Chuo Koron Co., Ltd.)
At the age of 13, he decided that "the exploration part before that is important," and [exploration studies] was born. At the age of 22, he wrote a book titled "KJ-ho [Let Chaos Speak for Itself]," which was the culmination of his work. The budding of the "Idea Method" was refined through interaction with society.

　　　Understanding the Situation and Pursuing the Essence
　　Evaluation and Situational Assessment
　　　Situation assessment and evaluation are two different things.
　　　An overall understanding of the situation is the basis for a valid evaluation.
　　　Evaluation should always be relative.
