　　　Q: Isn't it funny that CIRCUMLOCUTION is not a Symbolization of felt meaning, but you normally POINT F2?
　　　　A: I painted the wrong picture.
　　　　　I wrote it in a symmetrical form, but it is not a symmetrical relationship because it is to modify the felt meaning that the previous symbol points to.
　　　　　I drew "fix" as "refine by and" so it looked symmetrical.
