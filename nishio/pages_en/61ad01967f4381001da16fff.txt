Why hasn't a consistent system of knowledge description method been invented?
[Software is a consistent body of knowledge] continued

I wondered why a consistent method of describing knowledge systems has not been invented.

This question is wrong, and an artificial language called [programming language] was created and is actually used to describe [things for computers to read].
So the "consistent knowledge system description method" has already been invented, and it is not a natural language.

Why don't we get closer to [natural language], or a human-readable form?
　Natural language is probably an inappropriate language.
　　There are two languages that use natural language and are committed to integrity, [mathematical language] and [legal language], but in the end, the public can't read either of them.
　　　Because they don't want to pay the training costs to read.
　　　Most Homo sapiens don't want "consistency in their knowledge system" so they don't get paid for the effort they put into making it.

[implemented using natural language].
 Programming for systems that are a combination of human and computer is required.
