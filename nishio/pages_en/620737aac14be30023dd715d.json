Grace in All

'It is the life of talent, the breath of speech, the soul of action, and the ornament of adornment. Perfection adorns our nature, but this is the ornament of perfection itself. It manifests itself even in thought. It is the most natural gift, owes little to education and even triumphs over training. It transcends ease, approaches freedom and ease, overcomes awkwardness, and puts the finishing touches on perfection. Without it, beauty loses its animation, and grace loses its elegance. It overcomes bravery, thoughtfulness, prudence, and even dignity itself. It is a shortcut to haste and an easy escape from embarrassment.
