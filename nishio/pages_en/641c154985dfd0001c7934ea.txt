	Chain of Thought Prompting
	 A prompting technique used to encourage the model to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps. A less formal way to induce this behavior is to include ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step-by-step‚Äù in the prompt.
	 [Chain of Thought]
	 [Step-by-Step(LLM)]

 Action Plan Generation
 	[Action Plan Generation]
	 A prompt usage that uses a language model to generate actions to take. The results of these actions can then be fed back into the language model to generate a subsequent action.

 ReAct Prompting
 	[Chain of Thought] combined with [Action Plan Generation
	 A prompting technique that combines Chain-of-Thought prompting with [action plan generation]. This induces the to model to think about what action to take, then take it.
 	[ReAct(LLM)]
	 LangChain Example

 Self-ask
 „ÄÄExplicitly have question text generated and use an external search engine
	 A prompting method that builds on top of chain-of-thought prompting. In this method, the model explicitly asks itself follow-up questions, which are then answered by an external search engine.

 Prompt Chaining
	 Combining multiple LLM calls together, with the output of one-step being the input to the next.

 Memetic Proxy
 „ÄÄMake them behave in a specific context by having them play a role.
	 Encouraging the LLM to respond in a certain way framing the discussion in a context that the model knows of and that will result in that type of response. For example, as a conversation between a student and a teacher.

	Self Consistency
 	A decoding strategy that samples a diverse set of reasoning paths and then selects the most consistent answer. Is most effective when combined with Chain-of-thought prompting.

 Inception
	 Also called ‚ÄúFirst Person Instruction‚Äù. Encouraging the model to think a certain way by including the start of the model‚Äôs response in the prompt.

 MemPrompt
	 MemPrompt maintains a memory of errors and user feedback, and uses them to prevent repetition of mistakes.
