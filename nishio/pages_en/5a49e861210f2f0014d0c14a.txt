This War of Mine
A game in which three or so friends survive in a rundown house during wartime while collecting resources.
I would classify it as a [management game] in the sense of considering the optimal allocation of resources,
Personally, this is the most inspiring game of 2017.
I think you'll have a better experience if you play this one without spoilers.
Play it and then read [This War of Mine Spoiler First Play Log].

	A game to acquire the resource of "food" with the limited resource of "time
 The "deteriorating security" will lead to robberies at night, which will require a "defensive force."
  In the game, it is expressed in the form of "weapons" and "ammunition" to be consumed.
 When winter comes, you need "fuel".
 	Weapons and the common material "axes" can be made, and furniture can be dismantled to obtain wood and fuel
  All tools, not just axes, wear out with use.
  So this process is "the process of converting weapons materials into wood and fuel".
 When vegetables are difficult to obtain due to food shortages, the efficiency of food preparation decreases.
  It is possible to make your own vegetables, but I haven't tried it, so I don't know if it pays off.
  My first play was almost starved to death because of this.
 There is a resource called "mental state" that is difficult to see.
 	As this worsens, work efficiency declines.
  Means of amelioration include "cigarettes," "alcohol," and "coffee."
