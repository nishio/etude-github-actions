 *1480251465* I became a second class intellectual property management technician.
 It was on August 22, but for some reason I completely forgot to scan and blog about it.

 If you want to know what the exam is about, you can see past questions here: <a href='http://www.kentei-info-ip-edu.org/exam_kakomon'>National Examination for Intellectual Property Management Skills Past Questions</a>.
 I inadvertently failed to register for the first level exam.
 
 Incidentally, I also took the patent attorney exam in the first half of this year, and it seemed that only trademark was missing from the subject scores. I wasn't really interested in trademarks, so I guess it's not that surprising. And even if I had scored enough in trademarks, I would still be 5 points short in the overall score, so I need to improve my overall score. To become a patent attorney, you have to pass this exam, take the dissertation exam, take the oral examination, do practical training, register with the Patent Attorneys Association (35,000 yen), and continue paying monthly fees (15,000 yen). I am still wondering if I will go that far or not. I'll think about it after I get accepted. (If I get accepted, I'll probably say "what a waste" and register.)
