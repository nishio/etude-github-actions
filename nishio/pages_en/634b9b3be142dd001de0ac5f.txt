>Q. Is there a back number function?
> A. In the renewal of FANBOX in April, we eliminated the back number function, not because we want paid contents on FANBOX, but because we want fans to support creators in their daily creative activities and creators to report their creative activities in response. We aimed for such a relationship between creators and fans.
