When you have an important thought but have forgotten it
When I try to remember something I have forgotten and cannot remember it, I put "it" aside and write down everything else that comes to mind.
If "it" is still deep in the recesses of your brain, it's easier to come up with something related to it. As you write down more and more of the surrounding things that might be related, the information that is connected to each other might stimulate you from the surroundings and remind you of what you have forgotten.
If you ultimately can't remember, "it" wasn't that important. If it was important, you would come up with it again.
