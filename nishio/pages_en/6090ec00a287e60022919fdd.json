 I just had some business in Akihabara, so I went shopping while I was there.
 
 -Various cables @100 x6
 -Universal base @80 x5
 -Resistance 100Ω, 1KΩ, 10KΩ, 100KΩ @100 x4
 -- There were some 1MΩ resistors and such, but I didn't buy them. Now I have 10~100000 in 10x increments for now.
 -Tact Switch 10 pcs. 180
 -Green LED 10 pcs 150
 -Pushbutton switch @ 80 x5
 -Slide switch @ 50 x2
 -10pF @20 x5
 -Slide volume @100 x2
 
 Each of the small items is inexpensive, but when you add it all up, it comes to about 2,500 yen.
 
 
 Sheesh. I should have bought an IC with a flip-flop in it. I made a circuit that uses a switch to input all the clock signals and such to study the behavior of the shift register, but when it should shift one signal, it shifts two or three signals. I added a capacitor between GND and the switch, but it didn't make much difference. 100pF might be too small. id:TOKOROTEN told me how to eliminate chattering by using FF, so I tried that. I should have tried that. Well, it's already 8:00 am, so I guess the stores won't be open.
 
 *1248971123* Hot Bond of the Day
 This is interesting.

 This is what I was going to make, an ear-clip heart rate sensor (LED on one side, photo sensor on the other), but I used hot bond to figure out how to fix it to a clothespin, and as a result, I concluded that the hot bond itself is elastic enough to make it clip, so a clothespin was not necessary.

 <body>I know you probably don't feel comfortable messing with the bare minimum, but maybe going through the CPU is a good idea? </body>

 <body>Yes, that's right. I'm trying to do it directly to learn shift register behavior and circuitry, but eventually I plan to control it from the ATMEGA168. </body>

 <body>If your goal is to study circuits, you might want to calculate V(1-e(t/CR)) and set it to a few tens of ms. </body> <body>
