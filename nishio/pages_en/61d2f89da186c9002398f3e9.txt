I bought a cable and Vivecraft's 1.18.1 support is out, so I'm going to try it.

When I went into the Micra in VR, [LELIEL] was so big, and when I got in the water, I couldn't go up, and I was in a daze about what I was going to do in the water, taking advantage of the creative mode.
	Seems the fact that he was sitting down to play put him in a Micra crouch.

I took a screenshot of my microscopic experience in VR, but it doesn't convey anything. It's like this image is stretched 180 degrees into a hemisphere, covering the edge of my field of view. The sphere is simply huge, and the blocks under your feet are definitely the size of a meter.

	When I fell down the rainbow pipe, I had full visibility and the screen was not updated fast enough, so I lost a lot of SAN value!

I'm not sure if it was the performance of the machine or something in the configuration, but sometimes the view was so choppy that it was quite tiring!

[Vivecraft] Explaining the VR adaptation of Minecraft: amazingly immersive with the introduction of shadow mods! https://blog.endstart.net/article/vivecraft.html]

　I don't understand why, but it looks like SteamVR needs to operate the activation from the Oculus side.

Today's Summary
 I launched SteamVR via OculusLink and launched Vivecraft with the connection status indicator showing -> I was able to get an immersive menu screen, I launched Micra on the VR space!
 It's a wireless connection, so it's choppy due to lack of bandwidth and I can't figure out how to start the game, one break until the cable arrives.
