Is logistic regression regression or classification?
	There are arguments like, "[logistic regression] is regression," or "No, it's not regression, it's classification."
 It is similar to the discussion of "Are Python and Ruby variables passed by value or by reference to a function?
 	A case of [wrong choice]. In this case, the reference is being passed by value.
 Logistic regression solves classification problems by finding probability values in regression.

	 >Misleading point: "logistic regression" is overwhelmingly used for classification problems, not regression problems
  > Logistic regression is a method of solving the classification problem of "which group one belongs to" by finding the real value of "probability of belonging to a group" through regression. In other words, it is equivalent to converting a classification problem into a regression problem and then solving it.
