Three bricklayers
[Aesop]
Traveler speaks with three bricklayers.
	1st person
		Brick by brick.
		It's hard to work all day laying bricks.
		It's not fair that some people live more comfortably.
	Second person.
		Bricks are piled up to form a wall.
		I support my family with this job.
		Thank God I have a job.
	Three.
		We're building a cathedral that will go down in history.
		Would be a great job!

People feel [fulfilled] when they have a sense of connection with [something great] (in the case of this story, a cathedral in history).

variation
	In some cases, the second person says, "I'm going to be the best bricklayer in the world."
