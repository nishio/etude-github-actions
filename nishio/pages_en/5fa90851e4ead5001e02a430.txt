 Thoughts.
  Sell 200,000 different products 200,000 times
  We want to lower the cost of inventory checks.
  　Query 2,3 with successful sales numbers a,b
  　　The number of inventory remaining when sold in bulk will update this value.
  　Pre-calculate the minimum value of the range for queries 2 and 3
  　　Look at this value to see if query 2 or 3 can be done.
  　For query 1, if it is an odd number, x-a-b, if not, x-a is the remaining inventory.
