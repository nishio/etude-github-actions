	>When a user responds with something like "nothing in particular," the score for the keyword used in the previous statement is lowered. Scores that have been high once before were never reduced, but that way, if a strange keyword is high early on, the question will keep revolving around that word all the time.

When we trained a model that identifies "nothing in particular" type statements with a miscellaneous amount of features from a miscellaneous collection of data, we got about 70% correct, so we decided to lower the score of keywords used in the chatbot's previous statement when a user makes a "nothing in particular" type statement.
