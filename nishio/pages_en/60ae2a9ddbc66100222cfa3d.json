支配戦略
支配関係
	A strategy [$ x_i, y_i ∈ Δ_i] satisfies [$ u_i (x_i, z_{-i}) ≥ u_i (y_i, z_{-i})] for any strategy profile [$ z ∈ Θ] and the equality does not hold for at least one [$ z], xi weakly dominates yi" or "[$ y_i] is weakly dominated by [$ x_i]".
	If a strategy [$ x_i, y_i ∈ Δ_i ] satisfies [$ u_i (x_i, z_{-i}) > u_i (y_i, z_{-i})] for any strategy profile [$ z ∈ Θ], then "$ x_i] [strongly dominates] [$ y_i]" (xi strictly dominates yi), or "[$ y_i] is strictly dominated by [$ x_i]" (yi is strictly dominated by xi).
		In other words, strong domination is when weak domination and the equality does not hold for all z
支配戦略
	When a strategy [$ x_i ∈ Δ_i ] weakly dominates any strategy [$ y_i ∈ Δ_i∖{x_i} ], xi is called a [weakly dominant strategy]. When it is strongly dominant, it is called [strongly dominant strategy].
