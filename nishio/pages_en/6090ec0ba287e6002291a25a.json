 *1344581148*How to type in hexadecimal in hexl-mode
 When rewriting a binary file in the Emacs binary editor mode hexl-mode, I tried to enter FF in hexadecimal, but when I pressed F, the byte was filled with F. I wondered what to do. I thought that I could enter hexadecimal by pressing F1-m and reading the help file of hexl-mode, but I found out that I can enter hexadecimal by pressing C-M-x.
