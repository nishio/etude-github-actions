16 hours of [videoconferencing] in 2 days
　In the early days, I worked straight on the computer during breaks.
　　I began to feel that "long videos were seriously hard on my body."
　I started doing things like sleeping for 10 minutes during my 15 minute break.
　　Still, it's hard work.
　The idea was fundamentally wrong.
　　Thinking again about what you would do if the event were physically held on site, you get up from your seat, go to the bathroom, and scamper around or stand around talking.
　　In other words, the reason for "it's hard" is that it doesn't work.
　　Standing up and wandering around during the 15 minute break, even though he is at home, and not sitting down for 15 minutes.
　experimental results
　　I feel like it's getting easier.
　　I was down for half of one session when it started raining, so it's not definite...
　　Well, but let's try to move around as much as possible for longer meetings in the future.
