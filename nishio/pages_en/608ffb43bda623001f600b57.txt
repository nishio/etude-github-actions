Scrapbox Simultaneous Search
I was using the Chrome extension "Scrapbox Simultaneous Search", but recently I started to experience layout collapse, perhaps due to this extension.
I thought about fixing it, but then I thought, in all the time I've been using it, I've rarely jumped from here. When you want to search across multiple projects, is your mind in a different mode than when you want to search in Google?
