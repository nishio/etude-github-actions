　Thoughts.
　　If K is small, you can greedily take from the lowest cost side, but K is 10^8
　　From the cheapest" means that there exists the highest x among the selections
　　　Possible extensions below x for each building are required in constant order
　　　So "the total amount of possible extensions below x, f(x)" can be obtained in the order of 10^5
　　　We can use a binary search to summarize the smallest x for which f(x) is K
　　　　[maximization with bisection search]. This time it's minimization.
　Official Explanation OK
