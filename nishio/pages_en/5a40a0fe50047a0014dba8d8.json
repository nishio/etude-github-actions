Incompetent hard worker
A phrase that has gained attention and become one of its own with the radical expression, "Incompetent workers must be shot to death."
The source is not clear, although it is believed to be the words of Hans von Seeckt.

Some believe it is Kurt von Hammerstein-Ekvold, and I will quote from that.
>I classify (officers) into four kinds. They are the wise, the diligent, the foolish, and the lazy. Most officers have both of these attributes.
>Some are wise and diligent and should be kept on the General Staff.
>next to stupid and lazy--although they make up 90% of all military personnel--are better suited to routine work.
>A person who is both wise and lazy at the same time is a good fit for the chief administrative officer. He has the clear head and the brains and the brawn needed to make important decisions.
>Beware of those who are both foolish and [diligent]. They should not be put in positions of responsibility. They should not be put in positions of responsibility, because they will always do nothing but cause damage.

At least we can be sure that "should be shot" is just a tail that was added later.
