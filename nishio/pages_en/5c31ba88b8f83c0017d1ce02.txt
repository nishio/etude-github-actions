Computational Thinking is a monarchical theory
[Twitter https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1081154259008184321]
	Part of a brainstorming session by [Kinta Nakayama] in preparation for a lecture.
	I thought it was [an interesting angle], so I wrote it down.

Here are my thoughts: 1.
For a long range of human history, most humans have not had "[others] working for them.
Only some people had it exceptionally well. Example.
	Ancient Rome, where owning [slaves] was common
	A monarch who has acquired the right to rule his people by force of arms or by divine kingship based on religion.
	Capitalists who have acquired a large number of employees through productivity enhancement by capital and expanded reproduction.

Computers can be "others who work for you,
You need a set of knowledge to make it work for you, and I think that is what is called Computational Thinking here.
On the other hand, monarchism is a set of knowledge that allows the monarch to work well with the people in a monarchy, and the same composition.
So "[Computational Thinking] is [monarchism].
