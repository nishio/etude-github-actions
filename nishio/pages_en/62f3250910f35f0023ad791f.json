metacognitive ataxia
I was interested in some sort of bad mental state X that people fall into. But I couldn't think of a good word to describe it.
　For a long time, the term "[old man]" was used.
 　Related: [a symptom of senility] [measures against senility].

However, I began to think that this is not an appropriate expression because "it can occur regardless of age.
　I coined the term [stinker] as an improvement.
　This is a vivid metaphor, and it helped me visualize the situation.
　On the other hand, it's too vivid and looks like "mere abuse".
　　The expression "in a state of mind X" would be described as "smelly."

consider further
　The essence of the problem is that you can no longer recognize that your cognition is in a strange state (= smells stinky).
　In other words, [metacognition] is out of tune.
　Hence the term "metacognitive ataxia."
