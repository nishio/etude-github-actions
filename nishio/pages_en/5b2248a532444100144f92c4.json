 >Age requirements for Google Accounts
 > Your child must meet the minimum age requirements below to own a Google Account. However, in countries where Family Link is available, parents may help their children create and manage their own accounts.
 In Japan, the requirement for account ownership is 13 years of age or older, but since the country is eligible for Family Link, parents can create their own accounts.
