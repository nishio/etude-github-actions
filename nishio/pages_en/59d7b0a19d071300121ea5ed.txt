2018 Research Plan
 The changes that information processing technology is bringing to society
  Change, of course, includes technological advances brought about by information processing technology (such as Mr. Ochiai's [computational nature]).
  On the other hand, information processing technology enables diverse ways of working and actually generates diverse ways of working, leading to changes in organizational forms and management methodologies
   Parallel work in the context of changing forms of work
    Parallel work creates a pipeline between different organizations and is a kick-start for open innovation.
    Diversity increases the speed of search.
    On the flip side, diversity increases communication costs.
    As forms of communication change and supporting software evolves, discontinuous change can occur

 Advances in Machine Learning Technology+.
  Examples of functions that could not be acquired by humans through language-based thinking, but can be acquired through numerical-based optimization
  Computational acquisition of language meaning as seen in word2vec
  natural language processing
  Changing forms of communication between people

 Language Support
  Support for formalization and internalization
  The Future of Groupware

 Evolutionary History of Programming Languages
  Programming is verbalized by an artificial language
  Language evolution has increased the efficiency of verbalization.
  On the flip side, there has been an increased demand for the acquisition of concepts outside of the language. Object-oriented, for example.

 unexplored
  Mechanisms for Innovation
  This is the effect of "selection by unfixed scale" as mentioned in Mr. Ochiai's column the other day
		Unexplored as a network generator
