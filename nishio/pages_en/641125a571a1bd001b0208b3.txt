[GPT-4] released
 [nishio.icon]I am writing a book on programming techniques and I am wondering if advances in language models will make such technical books unnecessary. What are your thoughts on this point?
 [GPT.icon]There are several perspectives on whether books on programming technology will become unnecessary. While advances in language models are certainly useful in gathering information and providing solutions, technical books still have an important role to play.
 	Providing [structured knowledge]:.
 		Technical books provide structured knowledge on a topic. While language models can provide answers to questions, technical books are superior for comprehensive learning of overall concepts and related information.
 	Author Expertise::
 		Authors of technical books are experts in their field and can offer [unique perspectives] and experience. A language model can combine many sources, but it can be difficult to reflect the in-depth understanding of individual experts.
 	Curriculum and learning progression:.
 		Technical books provide a step-by-step curriculum and learning progression to help readers gain a deeper understanding. Language models are good for answering specific questions, but can be difficult to guide the entire [learning process].
 	Renewal & Maintenance:.
 		Technical manuals are updated regularly to reflect the latest information and trends. Language models generate answers based on training data, but they do not always reflect the latest information.
 	Finally, while advances in language models may reduce the demand for books on programming techniques, technical books still have an important role to play. Both can be used to acquire knowledge and improve skills in ways that complement each other.
	[nishio.icon]Knowledge of the overall structure might be useful. Advances in language models will allow us to move fast, but thinking about where to go must be done by humans. A wide area map is needed to think about it.
	[GPT.icon]You are right. Language models have the ability to provide quick and accurate answers to specific questions, but to understand the overall structure and breadth of knowledge, the learning process needs to be human-driven.
		Comparing it to a map of a large area, a technical book or educational material provides that map, and the reader can use it as a basis for determining the destination and the path to take. On the other hand, a language model can serve as a road map, providing help if one gets lost along the way or needs more detailed information.
		Thus, technical books and materials provide the overall structure and knowledge, while language models complement them to help with specific questions and problem solving. The combination of both allows for effective learning and skill development.
	[nishio.icon]I think that in the not-too-distant future, a huge language model will also play the role of a map.
	[GPT.icon]Indeed, as language models continue to advance, language models may also play a role in the future of maps. As language models become more sophisticated, they may be able to provide structured knowledge, learning curricula, and holistic conceptual understanding.
	 But even in such a future, human experts and educators will undoubtedly play an important role. They can contribute to improving language models, designing curricula, and discovering and researching further knowledge.
	 Moreover, no matter how much progress is made in language models, there are some unique human perspectives, experiences, and creativity that cannot be replicated in a language model. Therefore, technical books and educational materials will continue to play an important role as a means for experts and educators to communicate their unique insights and knowledge.
	 Ultimately, even in a future where language models play the role of maps, the learning process will be most effective when humans and language models work together.
 [nishio.icon]Hmmm, that sounds so fake.
