	[Short extract from book]
	Model of what might be appropriate as a [boundary
 	This should have been "after the punctuation mark" without the need for machine learning.
	Model whether it is appropriate as a cutout target
 	Less than a certain length
  No mismatch in the number of corresponding items (e.g., parentheses)
 That's what's missing.
 	Sometimes there is an [indicator] that refers to a previous sentence or a [conjunction] at the beginning of a sentence.
		I can use pattern matching to remove the one attached to the beginning.
  It's a little difficult to have directives in a sentence.
  Later, it's also difficult to find cases where there is no meaning left if you remove it.
