Those who don't recognize value and those who don't recognize diminishing value.

　A "X is worth it!"
　B (Yes, it's worth it. Not as much as it used to be.)
　C "X is no longer worth it!"
　B (No, the value has gone down, but "not" is an overstatement. It should be something like "not as valuable as it once was...")
　A "Anyone who says X is worthless wants to pretend that X is worthless because they don't understand it."
　B (See, C said something radical, so A started saying something radical too...)

The concepts "diminished value" and "value still exists" are compatible, but they are converted to "no value" or "value remains the same," making them incompatible.

So, frankly saying "I don't understand" about something important is taken as a statement of weakness/incompetence. By the person more than by anyone else.

　So far, so good.

I think this is what is at the heart of this "object-oriented controversy". You are uncomfortable with the situation where object-oriented is talked about as somehow important, but you don't really understand it. So you want to deny that object orientation is "no longer" important.
　I thought this was funny.

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1602120118640988160?s=20&t=k3FeEzQHmB_PX8ApR-ji8A @nishio]: The assertion that "one would want to pretend that what is valuable has not changed in value out of fear that what is valuable has not been acquired. The claim that "you want to pretend that something of value has not changed out of fear that you have not acquired it" is easily inverted to "you want to pretend that something of value has not changed out of fear that what you have acquired will diminish in value.
