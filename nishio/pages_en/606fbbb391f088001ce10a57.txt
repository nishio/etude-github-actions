How much improvement? is a futile question.
How much improvement? is sometimes a futile question.

How much has the adoption of Measure A improved Indicator X? When we ask, "How much has indicator X improved as a result of adopting measure A?", we implicitly assume that we will not change anything other than measure A during the time span in which we can observe a change in indicator X.

Assuming that it takes 4 weeks to observe a change in X, in a case like this, where we did measure A in week 1, looked back on it and slightly modified it to A' in week 2, and added more measure B in week 3... we do not know which measure had how much impact on indicator X.

Especially in the [agile] approach, we are constantly changing the way we do things, so evaluation by the rate of improvement of indicators is not suitable.
