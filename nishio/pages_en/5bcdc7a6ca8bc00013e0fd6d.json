PresidentBot
	The explanation for using https://apps.twitter.com/ is out of date
	 >As of July 2018, you must apply for a Twitter developer account and be approved before you may create new apps. Once approved, you will be able to create new apps from developer.twitter.com.
 pip tweepy doesn't work with 3.7
 	I've already fixed it in master.
	 	$ pip install git+https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy
  If you put it in first with pip, you need to uninstall
 It was mumbled on my account, not on the bot's account.
 	I created a Twitter application name and a Twitter account with the same name, but the latter has nothing to do with it.
  Ignore the access token on the app's dashboard, and use the account you want to mumble to get an OAuth authentication and access token to use it.
  	Does this expires over time? I'll check later.

I'm thinking of making a president bot for the hackathon.
As input data
	Books written by him
 Cybozu-style and other articles in which he speaks
and others.

	It should be easy enough to chop it up to the right length and Tweet it.
	Run it in an appropriate place (like Heroku?) and run it in an appropriate place (Heroku?)
 Tweet quotes from books with a link to Amazon
 Tweet quotes from articles with article link
 Translate into English with Google Translate and tweet
	output and posts without likes and retweets are suppressed.
 	Collect data on how much of each output was responded to in the subsequent 24 hours

Quite advanced content
 If you talk to them and say "follow me", they will follow you and reply to you with keywords of what you say.
	But you'd have to go this far to make it technically interesting.
