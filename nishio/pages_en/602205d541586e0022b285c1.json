Conflict between motion extraction and question naturalness determination

Getting the context before and after the key phrase in "[determining the naturalness of the question]."
When a keyphrase containing a verb is extracted in "[Motion Extraction]", it may have been changed to the original form, in which case a string search for the keyphrase from the previous input will not find a matching string.

解決方法
　A: Change string-based processing to word-based processing.
　　Teacher data created in the past will no longer be available, so training data must be created again.
　B: Putting the information of "not found" on the feature
　　New situations can be taken care of while preserving past teacher data.
　　However, none of the study data on this new situation is available to begin with
　C: Upstream with a naturalness of 0.5 when an exception occurs in feature extraction.
　　If there is no data, I'll just leave it at 0.5.

I'll go with C this time.

Devise features at a time in the future when more data will be available.
　Active learning with existing data while accumulating data for new feature calculation methods
　Discard old format data when new data is accumulated.
