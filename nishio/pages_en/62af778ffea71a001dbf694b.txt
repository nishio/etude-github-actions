Six-round cumulative KJ method is less than 1%.
Jiro Kawakita used nearly 1,000 pieces during the five years from 1981-1986, but only 8 pieces did the six-round cumulative KJ method, just under 90% of the total [exploratory net].
Well, it's not surprising that the number of pieces of time-consuming items is small, so I would really like to know the percentage of time spent on them, but I guess we don't have that data.

[Jiro Kawakita did KJ method about 10% of the time.]
