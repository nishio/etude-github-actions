In "[The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production]," you used the metaphor of "[piling] boxes on top of boxes."
	[[Stacking boxes on top.icon]]
　I'm trying to convey the concept in various expressions, such as [abstraction], making [models] ([modeling]), [discovering patterns], etc.
　　These words [labeling the experience] are not understood by those who have not experienced it.
　　I know it's impossible, but I'm forcing myself to explain it in words.
		The concept of [[pile on top.icons]] can only be acquired by oneself by [[pile on top.icons]].

A more detailed expression is [cumulative effect of ideas].
	[[Cumulative effect of ideas.icon]]

This "lower box" is first described in the storyline of the engineer's intellectual production techniques as being obtained through "information gathering"
	[[Collect and arrange.icons]][Collect and arrange]]
But not only that, there are boxes obtained by [trial and error].
	[[Trial and error is hard to see.icon]][Trial and error is hard to see]]
	Often neglected because it is difficult to see, but important
　This means information obtained from "[my experience]" by trying it out myself.

The [advent of knowledge-providing services] has streamlined the collection from [already written knowledge].
　As a result, the importance of "[invisible trial and error]" will increase even more.
　[work that is pioneering the forest of what has yet to be written].

[The higher the concept, the less likely it is to become obsolete].
