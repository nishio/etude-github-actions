 I tried to use jQuery in a simple app that uses UIWebView to display HTML, but for some reason it didn't work. As it turns out, it was because when I added the JavaScript file to the project, XCode recognized it as a compile target and did not copy it into the app. You need to go to the Copy Bundle Resource below.
