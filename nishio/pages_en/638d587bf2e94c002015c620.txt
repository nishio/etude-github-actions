Hit me with a bigger subject.
[https://gyazo.com/3cce7c11562dfadcb18cfebe5ab8da75]
E.g.: "I find it offensive" -> "Society does not tolerate it."
　The phenomenon of attacking vague and large concepts by representing them as if they were people.
　　[incorrect personification].
　[large subject statement].
　[Attack]

Similar in structure to a child's "[I'll tell the teacher]"
　In this case, the teacher is a human being
　We are not acting on behalf of the attack.
　　The teacher's values determine whether he should scold, and if necessary, he scolds.
　　Not if the child understands it.
　　Some children may have internalized the teacher's values and had more success in telling the truth.
　Those who have tasted a "strong position" and "[justice]" by seeing someone scolded by a teacher for telling on them will feel "[disempowered]" when they grow up and lose their "teacher"!
