	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404462089637298186]: The title is "Zanzan" but the original purpose of this is that there is no calculation nordon for the remainder. The remainder calculation itself is a "subtract as much as you can" mechanism. The interesting point is to use multiplication to store a specific value in the counter in one frame, and to do the store in the next frame after the reset with a one frame delay "from NOT+0".
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404463611737559040]: If you put NOT and "when changed from 0" on a signal line where 1 comes in only one frame, you have a signal line with a one frame delay. If you reset the counter with the former and multiply the latter by the signal line with a large value flowing and put it in the counter addition, you can store that large value in the counter.
　Postscript, other patterns appear below.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404472472703934466]: I've come up with a topic for the Hajime Pro competition, but it's probably a D problem out of the blue.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404476048566226948]: "Find all prime numbers with three or fewer digits. Seek all means that a single number display block should show all prime numbers for at least one frame and no non-prime numbers."
	>Three digits raises the bar because we can't use nodons that are proportional to the definitional range.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404477102439550976]: If it were "less than two digits", it would be possible to line up 100 Nordons in a row and Eratosthenes would be able to do it, making the problem easier.
 > The only problem is that with everything under 3 digits, it seems that with a little effort, you won't be able to fit it into the 30 seconds that can be recorded on the Switch.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404602812193931264]: I was able to create a circuit that only displays when the input is an odd prime number, but I realized that I had to loosen the regulation "Do not display non-prime numbers" to "Do not display non-prime numbers and 0s". Otherwise, I realized that the difficulty would increase in a place unrelated to the prime number calculation.

	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404672705362685952]: just barely got to 100 in 30 seconds (I'm starting at 11).

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404683377660227588]: i saw your tweet about no variables, but you have a counter, you hit the reset of the counter with a 1 frame pulse T1, and you have a 1 frame delay T If you multiply T2 and X by the increment of the counter, you can save the value of X. I'll make a sample later.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404734949094133762]: note that there is a 1 frame delay between the input and output of the counter (NOT, for example), so there may be a way to make it work.
	>[uchan_nos https://twitter.com/uchan_nos/status/1404735313193226252]: if there is a delay, is it possible to shift the numbers in sequence like a shift register?
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404739962940006400]: you can do something close to that, but you need to be creative because there is no set of values, only addition and subtraction.

	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404743122815311879]: should I just do b+=a-b...(strange world where the time cost of subtraction is 0)

	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404747029687930881]: if we take advantage of the zero subtraction cost, this circuit that uses two frames for "reset and add" can be done in one frame > [nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404669347751100417]: Hizelofiruta

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1404747673807122438]: ah, this is smart. I should just subtract my own output:.
 >[OffGao6502 https://twitter.com/OffGao6502/status/1404746483686002692]: for those who lament the lack of "variables", if it helps.
 >You can create a mechanism to assign a value at any timing with 3 nods: "counter", "keisan (x)", and 0.00/1.00 binary signal. https://twitter.com/i/status/1404746483686002692
 >[OffGao6502 https://twitter.com/OffGao6502/status/1404748070504386562]: sorry, I have to block the input as well, so 4 node.
 >1.00 the moment the signal came in.
 > ・Decrease" the value of the counter by the value of the counter
 > (Reset)
 > ・"Increase" the value of the counter by the value you want to assign.
 > (Real substitution)
 > simultaneously to achieve variable assignment.
