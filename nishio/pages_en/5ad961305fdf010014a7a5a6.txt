Horseshoe Prior
	Distribution sampling the variance of the normal distribution from the half Cauchy distribution
 	Suppose this is the distribution of weights
	Very wide slopes due to [Cauchy distribution] effect = robust
 	The Cauchy distribution is a very wide distribution with no definable mean or variance
 But the origin spike is high.
  Is it greater than zero?
  	No, so it does not collapse to just 0.
