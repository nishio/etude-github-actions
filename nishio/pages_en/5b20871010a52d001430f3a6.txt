Wireless presentation from iPad via AppleTV
 Connect AppleTV to power source and connect to projector via HDMI
 Just do "screen mirroring" from the iPad.
  When I started AppleTV, it asked me to set up Wifi, so I assumed that I had to set up Wifi to use it.
  Even in places where I didn't yet have Wifi set up on my AppleTV, it connected easily without any setup.
  Wifi settings do not seem to be transferred from the iPad (because AppleTV itself is not connected to the Internet).
  Bluetooth?
