	I think "[abandoning fairness]" is an important concept.
 The reason why it is important to abandon fairness is that in the process of moving from "no one is doing it" to "many people are doing it," there will always be a situation where "only one person is doing it," and if you say "it's not fair that only he is doing it," then the change will stop.
 	see [特別扱い]
 Insisting on fairness is seemingly the "right thing to do," but at a time when we are trying to make [change] for the better, it is harmful because it has the effect of "[stopping] the change"!
 The word "fairness" comes with a nice nuance, but in essence, it's "[homogenizing pressure]" and "[peer pressure]."
	The stakes are high."
