It would be good if Scrapbox could decide which is the priority among creating a table of contents, reflecting the 4th edition and typesetting.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[/nishio/human.icon]It would be good to decide which has priority among creating a table of contents in Scrapbox, reflecting the 4th edition, and typesetting.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "Scrapbox" is that "Scrapbox"?
[/nishio/human.icon]No bookish navigation, so you can't read it bookishly without a table of contents.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "table of contents" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]A representation of the author's hierarchical structure of a single piece of content.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > No bookish navigation, so you can't read it bookishly without a table of contents.
 Is there anything else about this "Table of Contents"?
[/nishio/human.icon] can be automatically generated by a typesetting script.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > No bookish navigation, so you can't read it bookishly without a table of contents.
 Where can I find this "Table of Contents"?
[/nishio/human.icon]今はない
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > No bookish navigation, so you can't read it bookishly without a table of contents.
 How do you know this "Table of Contents"?
[/nishio/human.icon]It's the same as the Japanese version, so I'm just lining it up.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "Japanese version" is that "Japanese version"?
[/nishio/human.icon]書籍の元のバージョン
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "book" is that "book"?
[/nishio/human.icon]知的生産術に関する本
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "intellectual production technique" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]The main focus is on the process of writing books, but the know-how of how to structure books on Scrapbox is not included here.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Anything else about that "Scrapbox"?
[/nishio/human.icon]I don't think I'm good for writing, not bad for translating.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "translation" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]Work to represent in another language what is already organized, finite, and serialized in the original content.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you value?
[/nishio/human.icon]Hmmm, sounds like you want to avoid manual work in creating a table of contents in Scrapbox, and avoid having to do it twice in the typesetting later.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What is the relationship between that "Scrapbox" and the "Table of Contents"?
[/nishio/human.icon](So, when you want to avoid it, what should happen? If the table of contents for Scrapbox should also appear from the typesetting script?)
[/nishio/human.icon]Scrapbox itself does not have the ability to create a table of contents, a human needs to do the simple work, which is not good.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is that "Scrapbox" the same as "Table of Contents"? Is it different?
[/nishio/human.icon]違う、Scrapboxから生成できるとよい
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where does that "Scrapbox" come from?
[/nishio/human.icon]すでにある
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > Scrapbox itself does not have the ability to create a table of contents, a human has to do the simple work, which is not good.
 Where is this "Table of Contents" located?
[/nishio/human.icon]No, need to make one.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > No, it would be better if it could be generated from Scrapbox
