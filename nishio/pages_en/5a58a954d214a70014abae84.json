A situation in which a task can only be performed by one person is a situation that should be eliminated for the survival of the organization, given the possibility that that person may become unable to work due to illness or job change.

This is how it is written in the [Knowledge Distribution Chart]: there are three people, but the task marked with a cross can be done by only one person.

There are two ways to resolve this situation. The first is to change the side of the task, "Do it in a way that anyone can do it," to suit the person. In the case of these three people, "anyone can do it" is the shaded area, so the task is to be done in a way that can be done with that range of knowledge.

The other method is to change the person's side to match the task, "increase the number of people who can do that method. In cases where the way to do a task is not verbalized, for example, the problem state of "only one person can do it" can be solved if knowledge is transferred through [collaboration], for example, by working in pairs, and the person to whom knowledge is transferred can do the task.
