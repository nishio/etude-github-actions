Isn't it strange that Scrapbox's in-page linking is not easy?
As the title says.
　Bracketing the same keywords has the advantage of connecting different pages.
　If you grow a tree with bullet points on a page, the same keywords may appear in multiple branches
 　There are advantages to having this connected.
 　　But linking to different places on the same page is not easy
 　　Link by specifying "rows" instead of keywords
 　　　Even though the line might be edited.
 　　　Implicitly assumes that the link target is dead text
 　　Shouldn't it be linked to within the page just by enclosing the keyword?
 　　　In that case, the advantage is that the "linked state" is preserved when the larger page is later split
 　　　　A line link would destroy it, right?
