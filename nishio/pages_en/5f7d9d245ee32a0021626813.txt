speak with verbs
>[https://twitter.com/y_sumi/status/1313777524132835328?s=21 @y_sumi]: Since we are working on [designing experiences], we should use "[verb]" instead of "noun" when discussing the world we are aiming for. For example, what we want to create is "a few faces. For example, what we want to create is not a "face-counting machine" but rather "to measure the quantity and quality of daily communication (in terms of the number of people who meet face-to-face)".

[experience = verb].
[Experience]
