Annexation of Scrapbox projects
[Scrapbox] merged projects in [case study] 2018-10-29

	I created a project to compile information about Oculus Go [/oculus-go] 2018-06-01
	But no one wrote in, even though I published the edit link.
 I wrote down everything and anything I thought about when I was working on my [KJ method in VR] project on Oculus Go.
 Maybe that's part of the reason it was so hard to write (all the general info on Oculus-go has sunk far below).
 We decided to annex it because there would no longer be a need to separate it from this project.

	Export this project with meta information just in case
 [https://gyazo.com/e11b77fa78e045f8b871646dc85749ff]
	Then export the project over there in the same way and import it here
	[https://gyazo.com/d0883dcfae80d6d80d5142b83e948e1f]
	You are warned that the two pages will be overwritten, so edit the title on this page.
 Import JSON from the other project into this project
 	Looks like the pin is off.
 Restore the page that I renamed the project here.
 	Because nishio's pin came off, I had to unpin all the other pages to pin the first one, tedious!
