Knowledge obsolescence and teaching poses
I see more and more people as they get older and in positions that pose, "I have a lot of knowledge and I'm the one who teaches," but that pose prevents them from bringing in new knowledge.
And knowledge is obsolete, so if new knowledge is not coming in, then more and more knowledge is being lost. [The status quo is regression].
Maybe we need to keep the "I don't know, I want to know" attitude no matter how old we get in order to avoid [becoming] old.

[knowledge obsolescence].
