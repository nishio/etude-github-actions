 >>
 A dangerous name seal that prioritizes that the first emperor can read, not whether you can read it or not.
 <<
 This, this!
 
 By the way, on this page, you can see what happens to the kanji you input in seal script. You can play with Jython or Zen of Python. I want to print it on a T-shirt as it is, but I guess it can't be reused.

 Since I and Tokoroten are fascists and Nishio-kun is an anarchist, it is only natural that we disagree.
 <<
 I see. This explanation made a lot of sense to me. However, I would like to use a more palatable terminology, because using misleading terms like this may cause some people to misunderstand. For example, "Kyan and bazaar".
 
 >>
 So I'm talking about not being cost-effective unless you narrow down the participants to people who are already known or thought to be interesting.
 
 Or you should completely remove the smell of "nishio + amachang's sensuppi" and just be a participant.
 <<
 
 The former is a Kyan-style conference and the latter is a bazaar-style conference. If you have a clear idea of what you want to get out of the conference, it would be more cost-effective to narrow down the number of speakers. It would be more efficient to narrow down the topics to be covered and have people who are "knowledgeable" about the topics speak on them. The rest of the attendees can learn from a handful of excellent speakers. There are already many such conferences.
 
 Kyan-style conferences tend to be concentrated in Tokyo. This is because the more you narrow down the topic, the harder it is to attract people in rural areas, and the less likely you are to attract people who are knowledgeable about the topic.
 
 Bazaar-style conferences like 1000speakers, on the other hand, go in the opposite direction. They do not narrow down the topics, but emphasize diversity. The more diverse the participants, the more they gain. The more diverse the participants, the more they gain.
 
 These conferences should also be held here and there on a grassroots basis. Bazaar-style conferences should account for a large percentage, especially in rural areas. However, they are often small in scale, and it is difficult to get people to know about them.
 
 -----
 
 Some may view bazaar-like conferences as trivial. However, for example, for a long time after Wikipedia was created in January 2001 until it reached its current state, people said, "There are only trivial articles," "It is inaccurate information," and "It's all anime and railroad stuff. Even if each article is small, if a system can be created to gradually accumulate information, it cannot be said that the Kyan approach is better. Besides, the failure of <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nupedia">Nupedia</a>, which was based on the Kyan approach, is the reason why Wikipedia, which is based on the bazaar approach, was created.
 
 The 1000 Speakers Conference is a project that will take 8 years to reach 1000 speakers, doing it once a month, and it is impossible to predict whether in 8 years we will have a "system that keeps opening continuously" like Wikipedia, or whether we will run out of arrows and break our swords in the process. But at least things are going in the right direction now, with local events being held and people coming forward to help out.

 A study group is a place to exchange motivation and passion, not a place to receive one-sided revelations.
 <<
 
 I have the exact same thought, but I think that means that both me and Wankuma are bazaar oriented. I think it is easy to be one-directional in a gyan style study group.

 Why do people study English over Hindi or Swahili?
 It's because it's more valuable to study English.
 
 Therefore, it is superior to have knowledge that is valued by a wider range of people.
 <<
 
 'Worthwhile' is subjective. Which is more valuable to a company looking to establish a subsidiary in India, Mr. E, who can speak English at a daily conversational level, or Mr. H, who can speak Hindi at a daily conversational level?
 
 Furthermore, there are many people who learn it because they think "having knowledge that is valued by a wide range of people is excellent," so they cannot differentiate themselves with that knowledge. Would "I can speak English at a daily conversational level" be a selling point?
 
 For example, let's say there is Mr. X, who is 27 years old like me and has been a recluse for 12 years since the summer of 15, playing games all the time. He has "knowledge of games" that I don't have, and I have "knowledge of programming" that he doesn't have. Of course, it is tempting to think that I am better than him. But that's because they think game knowledge is trivial. He doesn't value game knowledge. Maybe Mr. X will publish a book about Japanese galge and it will sell like hotcakes in the U.S. Or maybe he will get an interview at Nintendo and impress the interviewer with his deep insight into games. Neither of these is something I can do. If that's the case, wouldn't life be richer if I gave up my silly sense of superiority?

 id:terazzo I'm talking about the fact that if you think of it as an inclusive relationship of the knowledge you have, it's semi-ordered. If you learn something you don't know from others, you will always be greater than you were in the past, so everyone around you is really a teacher.
 <<
 
 After all, it is an "idea" that one can be happier with this kind of thought, not a universal "truth. I believe in this philosophy, but I don't think it's a good idea to force others to believe in it as well.
 
 -----
 
 Aside from that, too many Japanese people lack self-confidence. Is it because Japanese education tends to be too much like a monastery? When I was in junior high and high school, there were students who were better at math than their teachers and made doujinshi-like explanatory printouts, or there were students who had a strong grasp of the origins of place names and the teachers asked for explanations during geography class.
 
 I hope the bazaar-like conference will give me more confidence.
 
 *1218950223* Household Diary Sequel
 Yesterday's fried rice was a little tough because I fried it too much, but I froze it and microwaved it and it became sort of puffed up. I also sprinkled a lot of garlic sesame seeds on it and it became garlicky and delicious.
 
 
 It's acceptable, but it tastes strong. I'll use a little less next time.

 Today's cooking. Spinach, chives, and what else?

 Suspicion of too many vegetables

 Vegetables are fine because they get smaller when cooked.

 When it is finished, I think it could have been a little more. I cooked one cup of rice for this and one more cup for the other.
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20080817203431j:image
 
 - 2 cups of rice 1200 kcal
 - 2 eggs 150 kcal
 - 1 carrot 70kcal
 - 1/8 of a cabbage 40 kcal
 - 1 bunch (100g?) 20kcal
 - 1 bunashimeji mushroom (100g?) 18kcal
 - A little sesame oil, a few sesame seeds
 
 Divided by 4, it is about 350 kcal. It took about one hour.
 Although I make fried rice with some kind of calorie counting, rice accounts for most of the vegetables and rice in making fried rice. The problem with eating out is that the amount of vegetables is low while the amount of rice is high. If you make it yourself, you can reduce the amount of rice and add more vegetables.
 
 A bunch of spinach is just like this if you boil it.

 *1218968526* T-shirt
 I was in a hurry to create an account in the same place as the /dev/null T-shirt, because I was afraid that September would come without making a Jython T-shirt after all.
 http://www.upsold.com/imshop/index.php?main_page=multi_color_product_info&affiliate=1607&products_id=364231&affiliate_banner_id=1&visit=1
 
 I was told how to make them cheaply (http://d.hatena.ne.jp/gomi-box/20080623/1214227751) but after seeing how hard the shipping process is, I lost my motivation to do it. Thanks for your hard work.
 
 The mail for the completion of the registration was sent at 18:59, and the mail for the approval of the product was sent at 21:07. So, where can I buy it? _?)
 
 
 Oh, there it is: http://store.upsold.com/nishio
 Maybe, but it looks like I need to create a "brand" and register the design I created with that brand or tag it. I did both of those and then checked and it was on the list. Creating a brand is a must, I'm sure.
 In the meantime, if I buy this now, will it be ready for JJUG?

 Total excluding shipping charges 1 2,205 yen
 Shipping cost 525 yen
 Discount on personal purchases (30% off apparel, 20% off other items) -661 yen
 Member purchase discount (5% discount except for some products) -0 yen
 Total payment 2,069 yen

 I was able to pay by credit card with Kuroneko Payments or something like that. I'm the author so it's 2,000 yen, but for others it's about 2,700 yen. That's a little expensive. Well, I just wanted to wear the T-shirt I designed by myself, so I wanted to avoid any hassle as much as possible.

 <body> Nice to meet you. One theory I have. <br><br><br> I would divide the Net into three age categories: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd period. <br><br>The people in the first period have a sense of design and try to see things in principle. Therefore, they are monistic. On the other hand, they have a mischievous sense of humor and lie. Relatively speaking, they try to see the other side of the argument. It is a race that loves to build. <br> Before I explain the second term, I will explain the third term. <br> The people in the third period have a rather obtuse sense of design. This is because they are working on the assumption of what has been designed. So if they look for something on a search engine, they assume they have found it, and they are not interested in the mechanics behind the blog or video sharing content. Because they think they are going to enjoy what is on top. It's innocent; people in the third period have a dualistic view and want to divide into an enemy/friend scheme. They use a lot of statements with the eyes of the gallery in mind, so many of the words sound like something you've heard somewhere else. And they like to label. They are a race that likes to be herded. See "The Art of Rebuttal in the Age of the Internet." <br> And those in their second term are watching the process of transitioning from the first to the third term. Although they are watching, they were not able to participate in the first period, and, on the other hand, they do not see the design as obvious as those in the third period. So they have to suffer in a semi-awake state. from the perspective of those in the second period, both those in the first period and those in the third period feel that they are making strange statements, not to mention those in the third period, who are not as self-aware of the design as those in the third period. I can't keep up with them because they take everything for granted and are too insensitive to design; I'm up in arms at the first term people because they continue with their old-fashioned sensibilities. <br> People in the second period have a pluralistic view. They can see in both contexts, the context of the dawn and the context of the stable period. There are other views: social, public, national, civic, personal...etc. But all of them seem flimsy and false, so they continue to be lost, unable to believe in anything. <br><br><br>This is the prelude, this is the main point. <br><br><br>These are just a couple of examples of the kind of things I'm talking about, but I'm not going to go into the details of the games that I'm talking about. Above all, we are blessed to be able to play the game for 12 years. Even if we don't succeed financially, we can gain a certain cultural recognition. There are game critics, you know. Those who say, "All I see is anime and railroad stuff," are just making a statement with a third-period sensibility and with an eye on the gallery. The meaning behind the statement is that it is frustrating to be divided into those who can utilize their knowledge of anime and railroads and those who cannot. He justifies himself by saying, "I am lowly enough to take pleasure in utilizing my knowledge of anime in a place like this." Of course, saying this alone will only make me look bad, so I say, "It's all anime," while adding a negative nuance. But I don't say what I really mean. They feel safe by flocking together because they cannot maintain their fragile selves. And it is the people with first-term sensibilities who take that third-term remark to heart. <br> Moving on to Kyaan/Bazaar, the search for talent will certainly create a disparity. I criticize Mr. kajuntk from a different angle. Providing certain information is not something that can only be done by someone in particular. kajuntk used the analogy of "spoiled candy" and "rare food", and I think it is possible to research spoiled candy thoroughly. It helps to properly verbalize it. The blogger would probably be the same. But then it would be a contentious battle. First one to say it wins, first one to join wins. If it's bad enough, the same thing will be lined up and people will argue about who to adopt. A similar thing can happen with "rare dishes" that only a few people know about. "Is that really a dish? If you eat it, it's over, but if you don't eat it, you can't eat it. If they eat it, it will be over, but they will say, "I won't eat it," or they will eat it and say, "Just because it was eaten doesn't mean it's a dish. In the end, what happens is a battle for the frame. Disparity is essentially contentless. Coincidence is a large aspect of the situation. Of course there is also inevitability, because only those who are interested will participate. <br> To choose a platitude, if you put a fool and a wise man in the same cage, the fool will remain a fool, but the wise man will attack as a revenge demon. </body>
