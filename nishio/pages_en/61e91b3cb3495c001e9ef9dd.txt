(5.2.6.1) Merits and demerits of nameplate making
There are merits and demerits in bundling and attaching nameplates.

The merit is that it reduces the apparent number of pieces. When there is too much information, people tend to feel pain. To clarify the vague pain of too much information, I suggest the [write all out] method. As a result, for example, you get 100 pieces of paper. Next, to reduce the pain of information excess, we reduce the number of appearances by bundling it. If five pieces are bundled together, 100 pieces of information change to 20 bundles.

On the other hand, the disadvantage is that it takes time to see the contents of the bundled items. Therefore, you need to make a nameplate which explained the contents of the group well.
