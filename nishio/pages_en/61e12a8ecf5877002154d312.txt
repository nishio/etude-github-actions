Array Determination
It is necessary for the book reading experience to establish the order in which the content is read, separated by a certain amount of contenents. This is called [finitization] and [establishing the sequence].

	>[Books] create an array of configurations, compositions, to convey one big chunk of meaning. It fixes the components and reduces the degrees of freedom. Because in doing so, the meaning stands up.
 > Of course, you can create "books" on Scrapbox. If you [delimit by a certain amount of content] and [determine the order in which the content is read] for each [content], the reading experience is no different from a book. The point is not the format of the media, but the presence or absence of [finitization] and [fixed sequence].

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1481860334101348353]: I thought I was copying Kurashita's use of the word "[one-dimensional]" in the context of "[writing is] one-dimensional". But when I searched Scrapbox for "one dimensional," there were no hits at all, so I was like, "What? I thought I was copying Mr. Kurashita's use of the word "one-dimensional".

 >[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1481862086276030467]: my Scrapbox had the phrase "[word serialized in one dimension]", so I thought, "Well, it originally said [serialized]!" but it still didn't.

  >[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1481865014898139139]: found something kickass [books are a finitization tool].
  	>[Without finitization, people will be crushed by information pressure.]

>[rashita2 https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1481867036666269696]: I remember writing that somewhere. I also expressed it a little differently in "[Scrapbox Information Organizing Techniques]".
	>>Books create an array of configurations, compositions, to convey one big chunk of meaning. It fixes the parts and reduces the degrees of freedom. Because in doing so, the meaning stands up.
 >>Of course, you can also create "books" on Scrapbox. If you divide the content by a certain amount and determine the order in which each piece of content is read, the reading experience is no different from that of a book. The point is not the format of the media, but rather the finitization and the determination of the sequence.

	I want to output [/shokai/brain as it is].
 >[shokai https://twitter.com/shokai/status/857625809980280832]: I've found [Gyazz] so much that the information structure of papers and other ordinary texts/books seems like a wacky thing to me, so I'm not sure if people who are enjoying Scrapbox now will do so in a while. I think it might happen to those who are enjoying Scrapbox now after a while.
	>[shokai https://twitter.com/shokai/status/857626678415155200]: The value of the work of transforming a linear structure into a format that is less responsive to people, while taking care not to reduce the amount of information as much as possible, will be lost. It's not worth the effort.
	>[shokai https://twitter.com/shokai/status/857629679699640321]: And look at the people who are serious about doing it in TeX, they are insane!
	>[masui https://twitter.com/masui/status/859216891750916096]: There is no need to "publish" a document as it is now that there is a format that can convey to the reader the net-like consciousness of the author as he/she writes the document. Serializing and printing on a stack of paper is just too wacky. The same goes for "e-books" that imitate it, which have completely stopped thinking.
　[nishio.icon]This is the position that the book reading experience is archaic (wacky) and we don't need to do the work to create it
　　I think this is the difference in stance between transmitting to early adopters and transmitting to the majority. see:[chasm theory].
