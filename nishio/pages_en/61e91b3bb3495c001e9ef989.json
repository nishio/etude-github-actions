(5.5) Summary
In this chapter, I explained the methods to organize information in your mind:

	write all out
	check you have sufficient information
	spread them on the desk
	put related pieces closely
	add nameplates and compress
	visualize the relationships
	convert them into one-dimensional sentences		

I often use the method to make books and lecture materials. I am confident that the method increased my productivity in writing.

In this chapter, I explained three concepts: 

	write all out to prevent them disappear
	organize group bottom up to find a new structure
	attach a nameplate that summarizes the group well to compress them

Those are important processes of intellectual production. I emphasized why we need to organize groups bottom-up rather than top-down.

The method is based on the KJ method, which was proposed in 1964. I use the paper piece with glue which was on sale in 1980. I customized the method from 2011 to 2018, according to the situation that I need to write books as a part-time author.

By understand the principle, you can customize it for your own situation. It is better than try to copy the original method.

In the next chapter, I explain how to get new ideas. It is closely related to this chapter because the KJ method is originally the method for the purpose.
