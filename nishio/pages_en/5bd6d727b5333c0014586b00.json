	Personal.
 	Put something different around (0, 0, 100)
  	I can see which project it is when I look back at screenshots, etc. later.

   Also [Mother Monolith].
	At this point, Build & Run to confirm that the scene looks as expected above.

	Project Location
 	I was wondering why I couldn't find it, but somehow it was here.
  	`C:\Users\Public\Documents\Unity Projects`

	Enter [Oculus Utilities for Unity
 	https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-utilities-for-unity-5/
  Download and extract the file and put it in the Assets folder.
  Or search for Oculus Integration in the Assets Store and put it in.
		Oculus > VR > Prefabs
  	When [OVRPlayerController] is added, a [Collider] with physics is created and the camera becomes a child of it, so if there is no ground, it will fall.
   Since [nishio.icon] does not want to make a game that moves around such a map, add [OVRCameraRig] directly.
   Put [TrackedRemote] in LeftHandAnchor, RightHandAnchor
		If you go this far, the camera should move with the direction of your head, and the orientation and rotation of the remote control should also be reflected.

[nishio.icon]'s notes on his experience
	one-eyed
 	The ground was made into a regular Cube.
  [Choosing things with a laser pointer].
  When I zoomed in, for some reason the ground moved depending on the camera's orientation.
 Second.
 	When I made the ground with [Terrain], it took a long time to build for writing to Oculus.
  Deleted, but not once created?
 	[No ground required].
  [Slide Auto Move]
		I tried to use Unity-chan as my avatar.
