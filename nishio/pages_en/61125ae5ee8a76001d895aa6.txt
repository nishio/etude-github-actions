Why people who make fun of others' ignorance are idiots.
To make fun of others' ignorance is to consider "having little knowledge" to be stupid, but Homo sapiens is also making fun of itself because it is a poor storage that cannot even put away the whole of Wikipedia in its brain. Those who don't realize this are not only lacking in knowledge, but also in insight.
