People who pride themselves on reading are suspect.
Anyone can read.
	If comprehension is not verified.
	Just buy it and turn the page.
That there is nothing to be proud of in such a "read".
I know.
ã€€I was going to write that everyone understands, but it seems not everyone.
Only when what you read leads to results.
This achievement was brought about by reading this book
can be said to (do)
I know it's not something readers can be proud of.
If you can't say what your results are...
Not leading to results.

How much value do you place on results?
This is a market decision
So if there is an output that is observable by a third party, that's good enough.
Whether certain people value it or not is another story.

If you want to gain knowledge, read a book.
What is this "reading"?
It's not about turning the page.
Nor is it about following letters with your eyes.
It's easier to understand if you use a problem set as an example.
You just need to be able to solve all the problems.
Even if you follow all the words in a problem book with your eyes, it's pointless if you can't solve the problem.
Many people say "read" to refer to having followed all the words with their eyes.

Books with problems are kind
Because it provides a way to validate understanding.
How do we verify books that do not?
If you guessed what the author's answer would be to a certain question, and you got it right, you have [emulated] the author's thinking!
