First, there is the assumption that Home
from [/unnamedcamp/what is Camp?]
Camp in Unnamed Camp is meant to contrast with Home.
 Home means "my home".
 	In terms of Scrapbox, a project that you are running alone.
 	Or include blogs, etc.

First, there is Home, which is one starting point.
	Basic intellectual activities take place there.
	Independent thinking/meditation

In such intellectual endeavors, we post here matters that we would like to throw out to others, ask questions about, or brag about.
　The image is that once you leave Home, you go out to Camp.

>First, there is the home, where the basic intellectual activities take place.
 I sympathize very much[/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon].
  [Parable of the quiet room]
　　On the other hand, I don't have much sympathy here.
　　　>I want to pitch in, ask questions, brag.
  Strong "I'm here to see something new at the campground" feeling.
  		>[Topics in the range of interest are provided].
 　 When I came to see it [reverse Jenga] was going on -> I'm going to load a few myself.
 　 The person in front of you in reverse Jenga had stacked it badly, making it even more difficult to stack it -> [re-stack reverse Jenga].
 　 If you see something interesting (whether it is a reverse Jenga created by human intention or a naturally occurring wild flower), take a picture and bring it home.
　　Same thing in that they are coming to a different place than Home for a "change of scenery".
