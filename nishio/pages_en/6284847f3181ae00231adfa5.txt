Diary 2022-05-18
I'm thinking about whether to introduce a [diary page] of sorts for [wells], here and in the [Scrapbox group] of unexplored juniors.
In the meantime, I created the diary page manually before adding the automated script.

Many things are exciting.
　A relative's wedding that was over the weekend.
　Newly started TRPG [microscope] in [well
　Nota Tech Conf
　　[/nota-techconf]
　KJ method study group meeting
　　This was another interesting [improvisational] creation.
　[Draft addition to ""Group Formation Needs a Change of Mindset""]

I'd like to organize the experimentation on an unnamed project that I've been doing for a while now, which has produced a lot of interesting things.

I was asked to appear in a video on another matter, and I sent my profile, but I wasn't sure whether to write in the URL field something that just puts HTML over HTTP on my domain, or here.
The former has not been updated too much.
This one is newer, but I don't think the configuration is friendly to first-time flyers.
　The landing page should not be a list of cards if you are flying in from your profile.
