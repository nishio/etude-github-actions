(Column) Efficiency improvement by framework
There are various frameworks in the world. For example, in [(4.4.2.3) Read to eliminate things what you do not understand], I introduced four classifications for reasons not understood by [Takada Akinori].

According to this framework of thought, the efficiency of thinking improves. That is because there is no cost to make a structure by yourself. 

Suppose you feel "I don't understand." By referring to the 4 classes of "I don't understand," you can think as follows:

	Which class of "I don't understand" is this "I don't understand"?

It helps you to clarify the situation.

On the other hand, the following two factors are connected indivisibly like the front and back of a coin.

	Improving efficiency by a framework
	Increasing the difficulty to change thought by a framework

If you refer 4 classes and think "the reason must be one of them," you unconsciously try to make things one of the four and overlook something which is not fit the framework.

In situations where no change is necessary, it is reasonable to improve efficiency by using the framework that the past people thought. On the other hand, if changes are necessary, you need the power to break the existing framework and create a new framework. I believe that Jiro Kawakita strongly aimed at creating a new framework.
