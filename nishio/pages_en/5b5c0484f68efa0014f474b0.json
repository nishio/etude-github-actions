[*** purpose of this book]
　I want a good reference book on [intellectual production techniques]. I want a book that I can recommend when I teach [intellectual production] techniques to others.
　I have been engaged in research on intellectual productivity at [Cybozu] for 10 years. As part of my work, I have conducted workshops on how to organize and output thoughts at [Kyoto University Summer Design School], and as a part-time lecturer at [Tokyo Metropolitan University], I have taught university students how to create new knowledge through research. However, I cannot convey what I want to convey in a limited amount of time. If I introduce a lot of reference books, they will not read all of them. I would like to have a book that summarizes in one volume what I want to convey.
　But I can't find the right book. If I had to recommend just one book, it would be Jiro Kawakita's "[The Idea Method]," but this is a book from 1966. The abstract ideas are still valid today, but the specific methodology is based on the technological standards of 50 years ago, and many people feel that it is old-fashioned. We need a book for the next 50 years.
　If you don't have it, make it.
　I wrote "[The Technology Behind Coding]" in 2013, a comparative study of programming languages. The book is a long seller that is still being mentioned and sold five years after its release. No doubt some intellectual production went into the writing process. Then let me explain the methods used in the writing process so that others can use them.
　When writing "The Technology Behind Coding," I used a methodology based on Jiro Kawakita's [KJ method]. In the content of the book, I also used the approach of "Let's understand what parts change and what parts do not by [comparing] multiple programming languages," and "Programming languages were created by people, so they must have been created with some [purpose] in mind. Let's [focus on the purpose]" approach was used. Now let's do the same thing for "intellectual production techniques" instead of "programming languages" - this is how we started planning this book.
