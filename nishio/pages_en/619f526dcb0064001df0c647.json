There are multiple ways to compromise.

When the [ideal] state is not attainable, you need to drag it down to the [attainable] realm, and then you have [a choice] where to drag it toward.

Even if a person hears a description of an ideal state that has not yet been realized and says, "That's good," the person may look at what has been realized after [compromise] and say, "This is not good" because the attributes that the person thinks are "good" are unknown.
