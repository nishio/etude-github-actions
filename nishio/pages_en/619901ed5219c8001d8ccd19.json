Significance of the Research Department
Let's try to verbalize a little about

What is the business decision to create a "department that does not generate revenue in the short term?"

The resource of cash.
　A better resource than that.
　A valuable long-term resource
　Management's decision to change to

Research topics are given a top-down approach.
→Trying to convert cash into domain specific knowledge.

Themes are not given a top-down approach.
→ "Searching for which domain knowledge is useful (=theme)" is delegated to researchers.

Another way to say it
It's a business decision that converts cash into disposable time for the researcher,
That decision is made with the expectation that the researcher will convert that disposable time into something "more valuable."

The axis of judgment of "what is valuable" is not given by descent.
in other words
It is up to the individual researcher to decide what to convert to.
It is the responsibility of the individual researcher to verbalize why the transformed product is valuable

I'm bothered when people say "the converted product is cash" in this situation.

I wouldn't do it on a weekly basis because the granularity is too fine-grained.

Description of Results


As for resources, there is generally an option to "procure them in the market when they are needed".
With regard to knowledge, for example, "when we need a certain knowledge domain, we hire a consultant from the outside."
at this time
　Is there such a consultant in the first place? Uncertainty about whether there is such a consultant in the first place
　Cost of finding the right consultant
　Negatives caused by the consultant's lack of understanding of the internal context.

Unclear how they are connected.
