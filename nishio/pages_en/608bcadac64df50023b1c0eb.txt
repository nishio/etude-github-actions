Turn mentors into customers.
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387980167419625480]: If we apply the "solve problem Y with means X to make customer Z happy" royal road pattern that dimly emerged when looking at 100 applications, this is (2) "lacks the means" pattern. This is unlikely to be adopted. On the other hand, there are cases of adoption of patterns (3) and (4), so I wonder what the difference is.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387983915848146948]: It doesn't make a big difference whether you are (4) or (3), and this project can also be (3) by saying "The current computer is a black box, this is a problem. You can claim that "we will solve the problem by building a computer with relays," and you can be (3). But "Who will be displaced by it?" The same thing is not answering the

I don't think we are instructed or otherwise instructed to clarify the I think they accept the implicit and self-evident solution, "I make something because I want to make it, and I am the one who will be happy by making it," without any particular objection.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387989906975166464]: The reason why such a project with "only me as a customer" could be adopted is because through the proposal and interviews, the mentor's empathy is elicited and "me and the mentor are customers" by eliciting empathy from the mentor through the proposal and interviews. Therefore, this process depends on the mentor's feeling and has a strong element of luck.

If the quality of the prototype at the time of proposal was lower and there were more doubts about "can we actually make what we say we are going to make? But in this kind of project, it is meaningless to make it (1) in appearance only, so I think the most important thing is to improve the quality after all.

I mean a proposal like "they are in trouble because computers are a black box and they are learning about computers due to mandatory programming education. Isn't the means to an end excessive?" "Isn't the means too great for the end?
