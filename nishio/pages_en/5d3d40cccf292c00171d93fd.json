People who, when they want to praise something, belittle something else.
When someone wants to praise something, they belittle something else.
Why it happens.
	Lack of confidence in X to praise.
		If you're confident, you can just say, "I love X, no matter what anyone says!" that's all you need to say.
		I want others to approve of my "feeling that X is good" because I'm not confident
		So I want to talk about "why X is better".
	Can't name a single "reason why X is better."
		If it's clear why X is better, just tell them that.
		Unable to explain why, and their reasons are not sufficiently convincing
		So belittle something Y that is not X.
	Contrary to his intention, belittling Y will not convince him of the merits of X.
		No amount of "Y is bad" can make "X is good."
		It just spreads the fact that "some people can't explain how good X is, and they're just belittling Y."
		X rating is more or less down.
