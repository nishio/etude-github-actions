		Making a link to a word that you [don't know] is being done.
		You seem to share the "I don't know what this word means."
		I share, "I hope people who don't know this word can figure it out."
		Because even people who know what they're doing sometimes make links to "I'll write an explanation later".
		The act of linking is not a check on the actor's workmanship.
		Able to take action in the direction of improved shared knowledge within the organization, regardless of knowledge
