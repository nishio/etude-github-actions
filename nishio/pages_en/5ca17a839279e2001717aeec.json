New Year's Issue Spoiler Avoidance Experiment
2019-04-01 New Year's issue to be announced today
11:37
	I saw a statement on Twitter to the effect of "how long can you not know?"
	You've piqued my interest, so I decided to avoid the information too.
		I don't usually care about spoilers for movies, etc., but I thought it would be interesting to experience a position where I do care.
		And, if you miss out on the experience of avoiding the information in the new year issue, you'll never know when the next one will be if you miss out now.

	When I hastily informed my wife of this, she replied, "I learned about it on TV, I'll keep quiet about it.

11:53
	[Tomoya Tachikawa] says, "You're avoiding the information about the new era!" and speaks to me via messenger.

12:18
	I saw on Tachikawa's wall that he wrote "The New Year issue is XX!" but since today is April Fool's Day, it might be a lie and I decided not to check if it is true or not
	I thought it would be okay as long as it was April Fool's Day, and at that time I was fooling myself.

15:03
	I saw the Chief Cabinet Secretary holding up the New Year's issue on the monitor attached to the elevator at work.
	End of experiment

impressions
	It was too difficult to avoid information while living in the city center in this era.
	If you really want to do this, you'll have to travel... I thought about it, but maybe when I get on the Shinkansen, I'll know it from the electric board.
	I might have to go overseas yesterday and block out all news in Japanese.
