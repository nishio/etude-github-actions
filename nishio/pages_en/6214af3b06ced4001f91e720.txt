What is 90% successful in one year is 90% dead in five years.
>[Hiromi Okuda] In my sense, about 5% of what we set out to do in one year bears fruit the following year, about 15% in 2-3 years, and about 10% in 5 years. In that sense, I have a 30% batting average, but most people give up after one year.
> Trust your afterimage!
	To add a little more, if you aim to be "90% successful in a year," you will be able to achieve that after a few years of trial and error, but I think that achievement is brought about by a cognitive distortion in which "you unconsciously decide your goals based on whether you are likely to be 90% successful in a year.
 And, after two to three years, 50% of the successes achieved by setting such goals will have wilted, and after five years, 90% will have withered away to the point of no return.
	>exactly! That's right!
 > When you gain experience about my age, it is possible to repeat only "what I am 90% sure will be successful in a year", but you need to have the will to keep trying to go up without burying your current time with it, and to keep trying to extend your landing spot for results ahead of you! Supplemental, that's exactly what I'm talking about!
