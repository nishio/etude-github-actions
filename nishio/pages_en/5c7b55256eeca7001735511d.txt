Never give up until you succeed.

	It is often said that "not giving up until you succeed" is a necessary condition for "success," but one of the necessary conditions for that is "being convinced of the correctness of the theme so that you can continue even if you don't succeed immediately," and if this is lacking, it will only be painful to tell people to "just keep going.
	[I am not sure how to answer this question.
 	I don't think the certainty of rightness has much to do with it. People who are not convinced of the correctness will continue to do so, and even those who are convinced of the correctness are quick to give up.
 	It seems to me that there are those who are good at trial and error and those who are bad at it.
		A person who comes up with only three solutions to a problem will give up after three attempts, but a person who comes up with twenty will try twenty times.
		Also, similar to above.
  I feel that there are so many patterns where the procedure or logic is a->b->c, and when c is not good enough, people try to go through the b branch and fix a.
 [Izumi Kawashima] It must take time and effort to make a theme that has fallen from the heavens come to you, but for some reason, I sometimes feel that many people don't put emphasis on that.
 [Shinichi Kato] One diabetes doctor said in an interview, "[Gumption doesn't last]. We all know that it is right to cut back on sweets and exercise.
 [Michinobu Uda] I generally agree with you. However, I think that if there is some kind of driving force to keep going, even if it is not right or certain, people will continue to do so. And if he can create that drive, he will continue to do so for a long time.
 nishio> Indeed. In my post, I wrote "certainty," but even if you are not certain, you can still say, "This won't work..." or "This will work..." or "This will work... But if I can come up with solution after solution, I'd like to try it out. If I can come up with solution after solution, I will continue to try them without "[endurance]" and that will be my "[driving force]".
 [Haruyuki Seki] Even if you are not convinced from the beginning, if you keep working, your knowledge will increase, and it may become more and more interesting. I, too, feel that the ability to continue with a moderate amount of trial and error is important.
