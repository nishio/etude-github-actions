 I decided to try port search macholib and sudo port install py26-macholib since it seems to say require 1.2.1 or higher of macholib.

 Hmm? Oh, if you look closely...

 I created a new environment with virtualenv and tried to put pygame in it, but now it says SDL.h is missing... I wonder how I got it in before.
