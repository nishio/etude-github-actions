Avoiding failure
Why trying to avoid [failure] is counterproductive in certain situations.

Consider situations where the speed at which [knowledge] is acquired from the environment is important.
	In this case, "quickly doing something with [uncertain] results and observing the results" is beneficial in increasing [knowledge acquisition efficiency
		Because "[getting different results than expected]" is "[gaining knowledge]."
	However, if we avoid "getting a different result than expected" by thinking of it as a failure, uncertain behavior is discouraged.
		Achieve "[zero knowledge gain]" in a stable manner, without uncertainty.
