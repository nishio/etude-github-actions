ã€€There are several people who want to/do organize Scrapbox cards in Kozaneba.
ã€€[Scrapbox Best Practices 2022 manuscript v1] also organized the multi-person discussions that took place on Scrapbox in Kozaneba
ã€€Let's increase our affinity with Scrapbox!
ã€€ã€€It would require a Scrapbox project name.
ã€€ã€€ã€€Iconic Notation in Image
ã€€ã€€ã€€Anything written in link notation is actually a link.
ã€€ã€€We've known this for a long time.
ã€€ã€€ã€€was hesitant to move in this direction, thinking, "Wouldn't it be a bad idea to include features that are tightly coupled with other services?" and hesitated to move in this direction.
ã€€Dr. Jun Murai's talk at the Unexplored Conference 2022
ã€€>The Internet was created as an overlay network to telephone lines.
  > Then the lower layer was replaced after its usefulness became widely known and widely used.
  This story certainly makes me think that maybe that's a good idea.
ã€€In other words, Scrapbox should be the infrastructure, and Kozaneba can be used as an overlay to it.
ã€€This will allow the lower layer to be replaced once its usefulness is understood and it is used.
ã€€The concept of "infrastructure" is ambiguous.
ã€€First of all, I feel like we should lower the cost of "getting data from Scrapbox and organizing it" and "reflecting the organized data in Scrapbox" to make it easier to use.


ã€€Create a "Scrapbox project name" field in the map
ã€€If this is not an empty string, parse Kozane's text as Scrapbox notation
ã€€ã€€Links and icons.
ã€€ã€€Iconic notation is embedded in Kozane as an icon
ã€€ã€€Image notation should become an image kozane
ã€€ã€€The Scrapbox notation link is
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€Open in a new tab
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€add as a scapegoat
ã€€ã€€ã€€Would you like to be able to select the
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€add as a scapegoat
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€If I do this, I can open from Scrapbox Kozane, so that might be fine.
ã€€ã€€You can add more and more Scrapbox pages to Kozaneba by following the links.

 I changed it because link suggestions are determined faster if they start with Kozaneba than if they start with Scrapbox.

 ã€€I felt that making this a DOM link as well would make it harder to manipulate.
