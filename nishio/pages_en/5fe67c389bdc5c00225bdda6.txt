　Note that it was rare that I did not fall into a deep sleep when I fell asleep.
　And when I showed it to my wife, she couldn't tell the difference because she'd never seen one in "good condition" to begin with.
　　[sleep memo typical pattern]
　Too hot for a blanket to wear?
　　When I woke up, I knew it was hot.
　　That would have been just fine since it had been below freezing for a while, but was it warm yesterday?
　Numbness on the surface of the right thigh or a tingling sensation when blood flows after the numbness
　Dehydrated from the warmth of the wearable blanket and the hot carpet?

　Stress?
　　It's true that today is the real day of what I've been doing [PAST Past Question Practice 202012] for a while now.
　　Do you wake up early because of stress or pre-field trip excitement?
　　　I don't know if it's that big of a deal. It doesn't feel right.

　Not sleepy right after waking up.
　I've only slept for 5 hours and 43 minutes, and up until now I've decided that it's my day off and I should go back to sleep, but forcing myself to sleep from here on out hasn't made much of an improvement, so I'm up.
　Once I woke up, after a while, I felt sleepy.
　　Has taking off the blanket you wear lowered your body temperature?
　　Should I have taken my temperature before taking it off?
　At 8 o'clock, the morning sun shines into the house and it's bright.
　Maybe it was the lack of daylight due to the fact that the sleep phase has been receding and it's now 2:00-10:00.
　　You know, yesterday, after seeing [light therapy light] in the morning, I had it on at the lowest setting until about 5:00 pm.

　Looking back, I'm not sleeping well every Saturday, I don't know why.
