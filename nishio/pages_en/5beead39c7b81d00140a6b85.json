文字の分散表現
	Imagine that the [distributed representation] of a character is placed in the same vector space as the [distributed representation of a word
 The word "unknown" and the letters "un," "know," and "word" are placed in the same space.
 The closest thing to an "unknown word" would be "word."
 If sets X and Y are arranged in the same vector space, then for element x of set X, we can say "What would you dare to express this in Y?
	What is the closest word to "un."
