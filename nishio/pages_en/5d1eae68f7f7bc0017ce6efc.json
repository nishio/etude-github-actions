Trade-off between productivity and creativity
The amount of results per unit of time, measured on a quantitative scale, is sometimes referred to as [productivity].
 I use the term "intellectual productivity" differently, but it is often used this way in the world.

Let's call [creativity] the amount of value created in a unit of time by creating something that does not yet exist in the world.
 Newer items are difficult to estimate value in advance
 Value becomes apparent [after the fact] after it is produced.

There is a [trade-off] between this productivity and creativity.
 If you want to increase productivity
  It is more efficient to focus on what is already of obvious value rather than on what is of unclear value
  If you can achieve the same one unit of results, it's better to focus on something less labor intensive.
  In other words, "it is better to repeat at high speed the easy tasks that are obvious to produce results."
  This mindset lowers creativity.
  Because they don't create anything new.

This is the very [trade-off between use and exploration] itself.
The fact that creativity is undermined by the introduction of quantitative measures is also related to [not setting numerical standards for the evaluation of researchers].
