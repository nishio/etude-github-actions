　I'd like to see the trial and error of the development process reflected right away, but maybe even 60x60x24 once it's in stable operation.
　Either way, it's a different cycle of translation, I feel.
　Fixed a buggy 2-hop link.
　I was trying to put in Google Analytics and realized I couldn't write raw HTML.
　Is the linked JSON fetched beforehand?

　Maybe I'll map it to mem.nhiro.org or something.
　　smell of memo, memory, memex, mememt mori, etc.
　I'm aiming for translations, but I think I need a list page first...
　　[Scrapbox look-back function].
　　I don't use it because I'm annoyed by the pages it creates, but I'm thinking it would be good if a fixed URL could be opened and this look-back list would appear.

　Admin Menu
　　Recognize that the user is me and bring up a menu with this and that.
　　　Switch from Safari to Porter from the Scrapbox page in [/porterapp/Safari].
　translation
　　The translated word text must be obtained by using the translated English string of the title as a key
　　Record the date and time of the translation
　　　No need to retranslate if it has not been changed since the previous translation.
　　I don't think the trigger for translation should be access.
　　　First, it needs to be translated in bulk, and if the title is not finalized, it won't even be accessed.
　　　After that, retranslate once a day, updated in the last 24 hours
　　　What should we do if we want to translate something that was poured in at an old date and time, like the Hatena Diary?
　　　　When you "retranslate those updated in the last 24 hours" above, do you check to see if those linked from there have already been translated?
