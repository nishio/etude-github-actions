 I changed the position of the luminous shelves and made a desk like this.
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20090302175453j:image
 The desk in the old house is
 - Facing a wall, so when you raise your eyes, you see a wall in front of you → poor vision
 - The space under the desk is too narrow to sit cross-legged → When sitting cross-legged, you unconsciously twist your waist to the side → Not good for your waist
 The problem of "how to make a bookcase" has been solved. I was worried about the space behind it, but I was surprised to find that I could take it, so I am thinking of putting a 17 cm thick bookshelf in there.
 
 
 I would build a shelf this size next to the refrigerator.

 Wow, I casually clicked on the link to change to the English version and now I don't know where I can change it back. I left it alone because I don't have any trouble with the English interface, but I can't put in the address of my new house in Japanese!
 
 
 Cured.
