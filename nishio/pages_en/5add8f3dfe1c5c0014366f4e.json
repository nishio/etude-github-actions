Empty barrels are high sounding.
A barrel full of contents does not make much sound when tapped, but an empty barrel makes a high pitched sound when tapped.

Japanese proverb #Parable

 The more insubstantial a person is, the more he claims to make himself look great.
 [The less confident you are, the more you speak ill of others.]

a wise man keeps some of his talents in reserve

[Empty barrels resonate well].
