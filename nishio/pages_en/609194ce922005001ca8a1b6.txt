Agile Software Development Declaration
We practice software development
Or through activities that help them put it into practice,
They are trying to find better ways to develop.
Through this activity we have come to the following values

Dialogue with individuals rather than processes and tools,
Working software rather than comprehensive documentation,
Cooperate with customers rather than negotiating contracts,
More than following a plan [to respond to change],

value. That is, the value of the things listed on the left.
While acknowledging this, we place more value on the right.
