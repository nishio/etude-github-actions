　　　When I'm writing for a one-person project, I often don't explain what I know about it.
　　　It's like a different [chemical reaction] occurs in my mind when I try to explain something than when I'm writing alone because my state of mind switches.
　　　I think it's basically good to remove [unnecessary constraints] in putting into words what hasn't been put into words yet, but sometimes things are created by constraints...at what point should we switch?
