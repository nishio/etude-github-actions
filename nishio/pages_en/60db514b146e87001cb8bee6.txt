Social Triggers and Approval Dependence
It is a fact of observation that "getting a lot of people liking what you say" or "a lot of people talking about you when you ego search" can easily drive people crazy ([approval addiction], coined term), but I feel that finding references to your thought output ([social trigger]) can be beneficial in developing your thinking. I was wondering if I could take it one step further aufheben.

suggestion
　[It is evil to please the masses.]
　[Bicycle parking]

When I try my best to tweet a blog post about something technically interesting, but get no response at all, and I see that the trivial stories that I write about often get a lot of attention, I develop a kind of [resignation toward humanity].

suggestion
　[Brahma Brahma Buddhist temple]

In other words, it is a normal state of affairs that there is no reaction to what one writes. It is natural that there is no reaction to what you write because even Buddha did so, and to think that there should be a reaction is hubris, or an infantile sense that "it is natural for people around you to pay attention to you.
 Rare is the reaction, it is valuable because it is rare. (Really? Need to be reviewed)
If, on the other hand, a lot of people reacted, then it was a sign that something had gone wrong, that it was evil in the sense of [pleasing the masses is evil] or that the theme was as trivial as the color of the roof of [the bicycle yard].
　It must be avoided (really?). Need to be examined)

Is it OK if there are a very small number of people who produce something interesting to me and I "follow" them in the Twitter sense?
　That doesn't justify [ego searches].
