I didn't understand "Only those who understand can understand, that's ego."
>I saw a statement on Twitter that "it's ego to say that only those who understand can understand" and I don't understand what this statement means. I don't know what you mean by "only those who understand" being true, and I don't know what you mean by "good or bad" in response to that, and I don't know what you mean by it being "ego.

I had no idea what he meant by the statement, "It is ego that only those who understand should understand," but [Ryo Shimizu]'s

I understood it when he pointed out that there were three characters. In other words, there were three characters implicitly, and I wasn't able to separate them, so I was confused.

the characters (in a play or novel)
 A: "Only those who understand."
 B: "Only those who understand will understand."
 C: "It's ego that only those who understand should understand."
Mr. C is arguing against Mr. B. He is not saying anything to Mr. A.
On the other hand, at the beginning, B and C were so blended together that I could not identify them. Let's call this Mr. D.
So it seemed to me that Mr. D was saying something unfamiliar in response to "only those who understand" which is obviously true.

Once again, in isolation, it appears that the unclear meaning of the "good" in the "ればいい" that B added to A's assertion complicates the issue.

(After that is done, there will be a separate story about the unclear meaning of the word "ego," which will be continued.)
