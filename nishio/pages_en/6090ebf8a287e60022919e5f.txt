 *1214031363* It's so hot!
 I can now do things like laundry and put the cans on my desk in the resource collection bin. If I don't do it, I'll run out of clothes in the middle of the next week or have an avalanche of cans on my desk.
 But it's hard to get started on things that don't need to be done on the weekend but won't cause problems the next week. I keep putting things off. Things like sending out book donations, updating errata information, and writing book reviews that I accepted on second refusal keep getting put off and piling up. I want to be able to control myself more and get tasks done quickly.
 
 *1214049273*I wonder how to show Chumby to people.
 I brought Chumby to a presentation somewhere, but <del>MacBook's internet connection sharing is in ad-hoc mode, so Chumby doesn't work. </del>"It's not ad-hoc" (Mr. Ueno) Hmmm, then why can't I connect?

 Should I buy this?
 
 
 I wonder if USB bus power is 5V, or 9V since Chumby says it runs on 6P batteries. The non-Air MacBooks have an IEEE 1394 port. The bus power of this one is 12V. This one has more than 12V. I wonder if it is possible to step down the IEEE bus power, but I don't know much about hardware, so I'm afraid of doing something weird and breaking it.
 
 
 The ad hoc mode: http://forum.chumby.com/viewtopic.php?id=1111
 I had heard rumors that it was a pain in the ass, but it doesn't seem to be that bad. I'll do it next time.
