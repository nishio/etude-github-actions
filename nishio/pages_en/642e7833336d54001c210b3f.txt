 1: Create an embed vector of all English articles
 　I thought I could use the Japanese version since I already had one, but I didn't think about the correspondence with the English version, so it was troublesome.
 　I think I'd better rebuild it.
 2: Produce the percentage of each article's nearest article that is a "translated article" and the percentage that is an "article in the same language".
 3: Try to get the difference between the bilingual vectors and average them.
 	Is it useful to see how varied they are? Is the median better than the mean? Is it better to get the top 3 dimensions of the contribution ratio?
 	I'd need to multiply the PCA to get the vectors in order of contribution rate, and to check how many dimensions there are.
 4: Do 2 after crushing the dimension of 3


remarks
　If you update the vector index once a day, the style that spits out to a file means "I want to search, so I download the file..."
　　What would disappear if we were to put it in the cloud
