âœ…I want to ngkw the chain target word while the chain question is occurring.
from [pKeicho]
I want to ngkw the chain target word during ðŸ¤” chain question generation.
	Not possible at this time.
ã€€This is because the chain question was implemented with state transitions
ã€€Just express it in terms of up or down selection probability.

Fix the test case first
ã€€Right now I'm just observing the change in status.

status quo
ã€€If I ask Q1 questions about a particular keyword K, then I want to ask Q2 and Q3 questions about K."
ã€€This was represented by state transitions.
ã€€ã€€When processing the response to Q1, "If the previous question was Q1, transition to S2."
ã€€ã€€Only Q2 in S2.
ã€€ã€€Q2 uses keywords used in the immediately preceding question
ã€€ã€€It was achieved in a tricky way: a question that apparently takes a single keyword, but does not take a keyword in its implementation.
ã€€This would lead to a fixed conversation flow, even if you ng after that flow has started.
ã€€ã€€Even if the target keyword disappears in NGKW, it's still a "question that doesn't take keywords", so it's relentless.
ã€€I want to replace the score variation
ã€€ã€€Q2 increases the score when the immediately preceding question is Q1
ã€€ã€€Change the question to a keyword taking question.
ã€€ã€€ã€€Score increases when keywords match those used in the previous question

ã€€I was going to link to GitHub, but the repository was Heroku.

point of concern
ã€€Right now I'm returning a score of 1000, as appropriate.
ã€€When there is a return proposal with a score over 1000, that takes precedence.
ã€€ã€€[Maximum score returned].
ã€€ã€€Sometimes it goes over 1000.
ã€€ã€€â†’I still couldn't [âœ… chain questions not connected].
ã€€When the score reduction by NG is multiplied, the keyword itself is still alive, so it continues with a score of 1000.
ã€€ã€€This is behavior contrary to user expectations.
ã€€ã€€ I decided to use NG pressure just before âœ… to reduce the score.
ã€€ã€€ã€€This looks good because the score is 0 when 100% NG pressure is applied.
