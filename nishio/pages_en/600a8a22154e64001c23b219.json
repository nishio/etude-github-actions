　Verify that the expected output is returned for the input
　　First, check the behavior for various commands
　User input may not contain keywords.
　Access Firebase to clear the memory of test users
　　Don't let your memory destroy the test.

　0 is human operation
　1 is an approach to automate browser operations
　2 write a program in Python that interacts with the server using HTTPS instead of a browser.
　3 run the server locally.
　4 directly taps the server's internal logic in the same process.
　5 replace Firebase with a mock and all in the same process.
　　There's also a way to mock up Firebase next to 3.
　The way to proceed this time is to do 2 lightly first, then move on to 3 and 4.
