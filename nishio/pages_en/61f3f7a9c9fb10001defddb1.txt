Application and Capacity
Is it safe to change this "Application" (Application) to "Application"?
 >Capability and application, without both of these, you cannot reach great heights.
 You could use "application" here, but the rest of it means application/application.


There is more to be gained by applying for a higher position than the advantage gained by not applying for it.
Work is the price paid for fame, and something that costs little (a job that is not much) is worth little.
Even for the highest posts, there is rarely a lack of competence, just a dearth of applicants.
It makes sense to prefer moderate success in a great position to prominence in a humble position.
But it makes no sense to stay mediocre in a humble position when you can shine in a great position.
Both nature and art (innate nature and polishing it, see [excellence requires polishing]) are necessary, and the application ties them together.

Application and Capacity
xviii 
Application and ability. Without these two, heights cannot be attained, and the greatest heights are found where the two are united. Mediocrity is more gained through application than superiority gained without application. Work is the price paid for fame. What costs less is worth less. Even in the highest posts, the only thing lacking is application, and very little talent. To prefer moderate success in great things to prominence in humble positions is an excuse for a generous heart, but to be content with humble mediocrity when one can shine among the best is not. Thus, both nature and art are necessary, and application places the seal upon them.
