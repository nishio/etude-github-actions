	World-standard [management theory].
	You may be surprised at how thick it is (820 pages), but it's a good book.
	It is interesting that, unlike some textbook books, this one takes the stance that "the theory is not yet solidified as a theory, but is explained to provide a compass for practitioners to make decisions.
	　If you only introduce theories that are solid enough to be able to be explained without debate, you will end up using those solid theories for "areas that are not yet solid. It is a sincere attitude toward practitioners to clearly state "this area is not yet solidified.
