(5.2.3.1-4) Effect of changing format
In the whole process of the KJ method, we change the format of information.

	pieces of [fragment]ed information
	groups and their summaries([nameplate]s)
	[spatial composition]
	[illustration]
	[sentences]

Changing the format has the effect of changing the point of view and noticing your blind spot.
