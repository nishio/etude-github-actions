 Q1:
 OOJJ + JJJJJOJJ =  JJOJOJJJ
 OOJJOOJ + OJOOOOJJ =  OJJJOOOOJ
 JOJJJJJOJ + OJOJJJ =  JJJOJJOJJ
 JOJJJJJ + OJOOOOJJJ =  ?
 1: JJJJOOJOOJ  
 2: OOOJJJOOOJ  
 3: OJOOJJOOOJ  
 4: JJJJJJOOOJ  
 5: JJOJOOJOOJ

 As I understand it, there is no such thing as "correct IQ" in the first place, so these IQ tests are not "tests to measure correct IQ" as they should be. So what is the benefit of playing IQ tests? I guess it is "the fun of solving puzzles of moderate granularity" and "the ability to compete with friends by displaying scores".

 Q2:
 OPOL + OPOE =  OFOEOL
 OUOL + OPOE =  OPOEOUOL
 OUOL + OPOEOU =  OPOCOL
 OPOCOL + OE =  ?
 1: OP  
 2: OFOCOEOL  
 3: OFOCOL  
 4: OPOCOEOL  
 5: OPOEOU

 And, yes, some puzzles, such as those on the IQ test, have some model, some notation for how to represent it, and some parameters for each of them. Some models are created by combining multiple models. Since the notation is a rule for converting some value to a final human-visible form, it is possible to create a model by combining multiple conversions, as long as one guarantees that the final conversion produces a human-visible output.
 
 For example, 1,2,1,2,1,2,? is a problem created by a simple periodic model and a simple representation. 1,2,3,1,2,3,? is the same. From the "additive composite" model of these two models, we get 2,4,4,3,3,3,5,? The same is true for 2,4,4,3,3,3,5,? The model "concatenated as a string" gives us the problems 11,22,13,21,12,23,? If we apply the transformation "a substitution cipher such that the same number corresponds to the same symbol" to the model 1,2,1,2, we get the problems ◎,×,◎,×,? the problem becomes "◎,×,◎,×,?

 Q3:
 NIRHVKVB + RIVHNKRB =  VOVIVYVH
 NHRKRB + NIVYNHRB =  NINYVHNB
 RINYRHRK + RYVHVKNB =  VONYVHNB
 RIRYNHNKVB + VIVYRHVK =  ?
 1: VOVIVYVHRKVB  
 2: VOVIVYNHRKVB  
 3: VOVIVYNHNKVB  
 4: VOVIVYVH  
 5: VOVIVYVHVKNB

 Therefore, it is not impossible to create a program that outputs a series of "never-before-seen problems" just by randomly combining parameters. Of course, those who can even recognize the model may think that it is the same model with different parameters, but it is the same with IQTest.dk and other programs.

 Q4:
 NNNNWWN + NNWWNNWN =  WNWWWWWWN
 NWNNWNWWN + WNNWNNWN =  NNWWWNNNN
 NNNWNWWN + WWNWNNWWN =  NNWNWWNNN
 NWWNWWNN + WNNWWWNWN =  ?
 1: WWWNWWWWWN  
 2: NNNNWWWWWN  
 3: NNNNNWWWWN  
 4: NNWNNWWWWN  
 5: WNWWWWWWWN

 Well, however, I was able to get to the point of creating a question, but it is difficult to check the difficulty of it and whether it is answerable or not. It is true that the parameters are randomly chosen so it is a problem I have never seen before, but as the author, I have some knowledge about the structure of the model, and I have more hints than someone who is really new to the game. I was going to try to see if I could solve the problem, and if I couldn't solve it, I would dismiss it as a lack of hints, but so far there has been no problem that I cannot solve. Four randomly generated problems are shown above. I implemented a function to request additional hints when there were not enough, but I was able to solve all of them with only three hints. I guess "can the author solve it" is not enough as a difficulty check.
 
 Q2 and Q3 must be too difficult, at least for me, the author, who has to get out a calculation sheet and write golly gee, Q2 must be too difficult, I wrote it on the sheet and thought, "Maybe I can't solve it because I don't have enough clues." After thinking about it, I realized that I could not solve it in general but could solve it easily for the question being asked. Q3 was a nice tangled mess and I could just barely solve it in general by mobilizing all the hints and answer choices. I wonder if the difficulty level would be just right if I included an explanation of the internal model. Hmmm...
 
 For the time being, I will only publish the problem without posting the solution. After a while, I will post hints. Also, it would be good to measure the "time it takes the author to solve the problem", since it may correlate to some extent with the difficulty level. Also, we should make a simpler model that "anyone can solve" and then make a harder version by twisting the model. In this case, the model given is too complicated.
