the ten cardinal Confucian virtues (justice, politeness, wisdom, fidelity and benevolence)
Created in 1951 by the fourth president of Dentsu [Hideo Yoshida].
 >1.[Work should be created by oneself, not given to others].
 >2. [Work is about] working proactively and not passively.
 >3.[Work with big jobs], small jobs make you small.
 >4. Aim for the hard work, and progress is made where this is accomplished.
 >5.[If you work on it, don't let it go], if it kills you, don't let it go, until you complete your objective. ......
 >6. [Drag around], and there will be a gap between heaven and earth for a long time between dragging and being dragged.
 >7. Have a plan, and if you have a long term plan, you will have patience, ingenuity, and the right effort and hope.
 >8. be confident, because without confidence, your work has no power, tenacity, or even depth.
 >9. The head must always be on a full tilt, mindful of all directions, and there must never be a minute lapse in service.
 >10. don't be afraid of friction, [friction is] the mother of progress, the fertilizer of positivity, or you will become mean and unrefined.

It was removed from the employee handbook in 2017 following an employee suicide, but I don't think those are essential in my opinion. [The effect of any code of conduct is different when it is chosen by oneself and when it is enforced by others].

[Progress is made where difficult work is accomplished.]
[From long-term planning comes patience, ingenuity, and righteous effort and hope].
[From confidence comes power, tenacity, and thickness.]
[What is work?]
