People's behavior is controlled more by the evaluations given by others than they are aware of. When eccentric behavior is noticed, eccentric behavior is reinforced, and when [evaluation is based on achievement level] of the annual plan, people behave in a way that [increases the probability of achievement].

Even if they are not actually evaluated by [the level of achievement] in the annual plan, they are affected just by feeling as if they are.

[OKR's [stretch goal setting] is extremely beneficial for [productivity improvement].

In the end, we can't eliminate individual [cognitive distortions], so we have to create a system that distorts in a beneficial direction.

During the New Year's holiday, I got sloppy and didn't make any progress on the [Engineers' Intellectual Productivity Englishization Project (-20200122)], but I made 4 pomodoros of progress just by making my own OKRs and sending them to my supervisor without being asked to do so.
