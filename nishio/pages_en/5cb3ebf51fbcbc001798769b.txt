Facts and Interpretations
	Opinion that "[facts] and [interpretations] should be separated."
	Opinion that "there is no clear boundary between fact and interpretation": [false dichotomy].

consideration

	Suppose we define a fact as "something that can be observed by [the five senses]."
		False that "a fact for me" is "a fact for everyone" because the five senses differ from person to person.
		Whether or not "some information X can be observed by others through the five senses" is not a fact because it cannot be observed through the five senses.
		Suppose we define a word X. If someone else uses a certain word X, it is not true whether the use of the word is based on the definition, because it cannot be observed by the five senses
		X is the common perception of the team" is not true until all team members are aware of it
		Is it true that "I am having a hard time?"
			I'm not sure if these perceptions of my feelings are included in the "five senses".
			I don't think it's part of the five senses, but is it proper communication to say "that's not true" in response to a feeling the other person is experiencing?
