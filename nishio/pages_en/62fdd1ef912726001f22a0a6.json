>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1560090533816864771?s=20&t=67z1tWGZMKTQAZTqOJDDwA @nishio]: what is that QR code on the bottom left? I was wondering what the QR code on the bottom left is, but I was wondering if you can fly around in the VR space and take pictures with your phone in the VR when you see interesting scenery, and after playing you can access the pictures from this QR code, that's interesting.

The terrain was not created by human hands, but was generated using perlin noise. So the world is infinite, with no edges.

Reservations are recommended for the VR experience, but apparently not required, so if you are in the area, it's a good idea to take a look!

I tried to go from the Ginza side by GPS, but I had to be careful that the entrance on the Ginza side is only at the end of a long mall-like structure under the elevated railway tracks. The venue is G13,14, so it is a little below the middle on the map.
