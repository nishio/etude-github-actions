Product/User Fit
[Let's focus on Product/User Fit, which comes before Product/Market Fit https://review.foundx.jp/entry/product-user-fit-comes-before-product-market-fit]

>Product/User Fit-- Degree of fit between the product and the user
	>Product-User Fit: The extent to which you’ve built the right product for the right user.
		Product-User Fit: How well did you make the right product for the right user?

	>"There was a Product/Market Fit in a small number of very early power user segments" is a more accurate way of saying "There was a Product/User Fit."
		>The honest version of “we’ve got product-market fit on a small cohort of very early power users” is “we’ve got product-user fit.”
　　　Some people would say that there was a Product-Market Fit just because it was accepted by a few power users, but it should be said that there was a Product-User Fit.
