 *1321186134* Diary of my attempt to apply cutting sheets with water.
 I was thinking, "If I make a welcome board for the wedding with a picture of the two of us, won't it just get me in trouble afterwards? My wife said, "Why don't you use cutting sheets to put "Welcome" on the surface of your work, so you can peel it off and put it back on later? So I did it. I had the cutting sheet cut at Hands. I checked with the clerk at Hands, but he said that if it was water-applied, it would take a few days for the adhesive to harden, so it might be possible to peel it off.

 The day before the wedding, wet it with water in the hotel bathroom and rub it thoroughly.

 It looks pretty good to me. If you look at it up close, it doesn't drain well and it looks like a blister in some places. After the wedding, I peeled it off in the hotel room and it came off cleanly. I was happy and satisfied.
