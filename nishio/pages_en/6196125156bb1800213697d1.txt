[Mechanism for combining multiple resource packs].
[https://gyazo.com/5a4c77e9fc384b151da1140a3c0d5483]
　Originally used as a server resource pack at [CybozuHackathon2021] so everything was in one resource pack (1)
　When releasing a resource pack after a hackathon, it's hard to give it a title or anything like that, "Here's a resource pack with a lot of stuff in it.
　　The title "the one I made at the Cybozu Hackathon" is too subtle.
　　Therefore, it was divided and released by theme (2)
　However, with this design, the seeded part is the same object, so if multiple resource packs are installed, the later one will overwrite the earlier one and stop working.
　　So put references to all objects in the seed of all packs (3)
　This still didn't work, so I was afraid it could only refer to objects in the same pack.
　　I made a pack with everything I originally planned to make, but the problem reproduced itself, so it wasn't caused by the inability to reference across packs.
　　Cause.
