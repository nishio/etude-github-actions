  I saw this and decided to buy it because I'm going to have to use paper documents more often in the future and I'm scheduled to redact them to PDF for proofreading [the engineer's intellectual production techniques].
	12.9-inch iPad Pro
 	I tried iPads in the past and ended up buying the biggest one because the biggest reason I'm using paper notebooks now is "lack of size".
  Less than 1000 book cutting scans are 80GB, so we decided 256GB was enough.
 I didn't buy the keyboard.

  This article said to try it without for now.
 Where [Apple Pencil] is stored
  At first, I put it in my notebook with a ballpoint pen, but it's weird to take out my notebook every time I use my iPad, so I ordered a case that can hold my iPad and Apple Pencil together.

   I've been using it for almost 4 months since I received it and it's great, I don't lose my pens and I can pull it out when I need it.
   Maybe not for someone who cares about weight or size.
	Apple pencil charging
 	A 15-second charge lasts for 30 minutes, so after one pomodoro work, you can take a break while charging.

 Compared to paper notepads
  I used to take only black notes on the road because I didn't want to bring pens of many colors with me, but now I can express information using colors on the road.
  Able to copy and paste drawn diagrams
  	It is now easier to draw time changes; you can write one, copy and paste it, and rewrite the parts that change.
  Unlike a ballpoint pen, it can undo
	Suddenly the pen became grainy.
 	I've tried recharging, unpairing and starting over, but it doesn't work.
  The nib part was screwed on, and that had come loose in the course of use.
 I use [Notability] as my note-taking app.
 	I saw [Atsushi Kuchii] using it so vigorously in his work that I imitated him.

　Three years later, I'm now using a fifth-generation iPad Pro 12.9-inch
　I continue to use Notability.
