Flask Blueprint
 code:python
  from flask import Flask, Blueprint
  
  bp = Blueprint('server', __name__)
  
  
  def create_app():
      app = Flask(__name__)
      app.register_blueprint(bp)
      return app
  
  
  @bp.route('/', methods=['GET'])
  def root():
      return "OK"

It is minimalistic to do routing in app.route, but it is difficult to do when you want to separate files, so create a blueprint and add it to the app later.
