 *1280045507*[Kaizen] Dried laundry.
 I was told that you haven't been writing lately.
 
 Dried laundry. When I took in the last load of laundry, I folded it and fixed it in the basket, so there was plenty of room for underwear drying and hangers. You can dry it right away. If you don't have room when you start the laundry, doing it in advance will reduce the initial cost of starting the drying task after the laundry is done.
 
 Until now, when drying laundry, the task was to put tangled laundry in a basket in the washing machine, take one piece, attach it to a hanger or underwear dryer, take another piece, and so on. It would be better to add one more step in advance and do "separate underwear and shirts". By separating them once, "unexpected interrupts" such as tangled shirts do not enter, and the context switch between underwear dryer and hanger is eliminated, which improves the overall performance.
 
 *1280045661*[Kaizen] Double buffer of barley tea
 Recently, I started using a container in the refrigerator that makes 2-liter barley tea, which I had for some time but had not used. When one of the teas runs out, I immediately discard the old tea packet, fill it with water, and put it away in the refrigerator. That way, by the time I finish the other tea, a new one is ready. There is always something to drink.
