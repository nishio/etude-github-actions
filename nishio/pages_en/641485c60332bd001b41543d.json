 What does [nishio.icon]Derrida mean by "misdelivery"?

  Jacques Derrida was a French philosopher who was influential in the fields of poststructuralism and hermeneutics. Derrida's concept of "misattribution" is called "différance" in French. The word was coined by combining "difference" (différence) and "delay" (différer).
  Deference is a concept proposed by Derrida to explain the relationship between language and meaning. He argued that language has no absolute meaning and that the meaning of a word is determined by its relationship to other words. This interrelationship can be infinitely retroactive, resulting in a state in which the meaning of a word is always delayed and unattainable.
  Misdistransference (différance) suggests that the meaning of a word is not fixed and is always in flux. This idea, also understood as a critique of authority and absolute truth, is considered one of Derrida's major philosophical contributions.
