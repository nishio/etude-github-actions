 *1385823142* 3 ways to make something valuable to others.
 ** 1: Invest in unexpected success
 
 For example, "I made it and it was surprisingly well received. The success rate is high because it was observed that there are more people who find value in the product than expected.
 
 However, if "making it" is not done in the first place, "it was surprisingly well received" cannot occur. It is necessary to challenge not only "what seems to succeed," but also other things as well.
 
 Also, the idea is to compress the cost of this challenge and increase the number of challenges, which is called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4822248976/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=4822248976&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Lean Startup</a>" is one of the main ideas.
 
 ** 2: Determine the reasons for unexpected failures
 
 If you are chasing "likely successes," you are more likely to experience "unexpected failures" than "unexpected successes."
 
 We cannot learn more by saying, "This challenge was a failure, so let's try another one. The fact that something you thought would be a success fails means that there is a difference between your perception of the world and the way the world actually behaves. What is the difference?
 
 If we can find a difference in perception, it will help us in our next challenge.
 
 ** 3: Finding gaps in the process
 
 What is the most time-consuming part of a series of tasks that others perform repeatedly? What is most likely to go wrong? What is the part that makes you the most anxious?
 
 Identifying and resolving it will help.
 
 
 
 ** Postscript
 
 I have written something similar before, but recently I have been thinking that this is still an important concept, so I wrote it again without looking at the previous article.
