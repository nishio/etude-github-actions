Jochou
Jochou (助長) is an idiom common in Japanese. Its origin is a story in The Works of [Mencius]: Gong Sun Chou I.

A man was worried that the [seedling]s he had planted were not [growing] well. He thought, "Let's help them grow longer," so he pulled and stretched the seedlings. As a result, all the seedlings withered away. Those who try to help the seedlings grow are not only doing no good to nature, they are harming it.

We can not force seedlings to grow. Often we can only put it in good environment and wait it grow.
