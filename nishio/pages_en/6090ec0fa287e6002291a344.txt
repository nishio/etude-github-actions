 *1454840427* I measured the carbon dioxide concentration in the room.
 Pretty unexpected after 3 days of data.
 
 - Normal 24-hour ventilation alone is sufficient to ventilate the house when only my wife is home.
 - When I go home and it's just the two of us, the density goes up and up and up.
 - It goes down as soon as the two of them go out.
 
 I had no idea that just having two people in the house would lead to such a speedy increase in concentration.

 The mysterious movement on the first day, from installation to about 12:00 pm, was probably calibration. While my wife is alone at home, it is almost flat at 400 ppm; it spikes to just under 800 in the hour and a half after I return at 7:30pm. After that, when I go on a trip, it naturally drops.

 On the second day, while I was away on a trip, it was stable between 400 and 600; when I returned home at 9 p.m., it rose quickly to over 900.

 Day 3, slowly decreasing from 900 ppm. I guess when you're asleep, you're less active, so you produce less carbon dioxide. It was still around 750, but dropped to 500 during the hour and a half that we were both out to lunch. Then I came home and in 5 hours it rose to 300 ppm. Finally, after 5 minutes of ventilation, it went back up to 500 ppm.

 I initially took a "let's measure blood oxygen levels" approach to this matter, but we <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/ouch.hack/'>home hack club</a> at <a href='http://ch. nicovideo.jp/tks/blomaga/ar932992'>A story about measuring and improving the air environment (CO2) in the TeamLab office: tks's (Masakazu Takasu) blog - bloga</a>, I changed my policy, thinking that this would be easier.
