How can I get to know more people at the conference?
>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638345770624757761] I was recently asked again, "How can I get to know more people at the conference?"
> "It's almost like 'How can I become a programmer?' It's an unsolved problem in the system, and it's hard, but you have to make the effort to talk to them. In fact, as with the book, I recommend that you be as kind and cooperative as possible with people who seem to be at the center of the conversation, as well as with celebrities."
> and I'm returning it.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638346059750735872] "This may sound a little rude, but why don't you choose who you talk to as you would choose a book? I'm not sure if it's really that rude. I'm really sorry, that's really rude.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638346487326457856] "If you are standing next to a circle of conversation, you can stand there and read" "Isn't it eavesdropping? Isn't it annoying to stand and read?" I'm not sure if it's a good idea to bail and say, "I thought you seemed to be having an interesting conversation," or if it's a bad one, don't worry about it.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638346887588909058] "A good introductory book(???) The most important thing to remember is that you can't just go to a bookstore and find a good introductory book, you have to do some preliminary research on Twitter or something beforehand, I'm going to be pissed..."

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638349179721506816] At any rate, it would be a step forward if you could just go over to the wall and say, "That sounded interesting! and just being at the edge of a circle of, let's say, five people and listening to the conversation is a step forward.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638360106273488896] The key is to "say" "it sounded interesting," and if you are silent, you should at least say that with a smile, because it's scary as quicksand.
> Then the topic may be broached, and the conversation may successfully transition to a conversation.
> But I don't have to force(?) you to do so. There is no need to introduce yourself, just do it when you get a turn to talk.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638360406438858753] "Well, what was so interesting about it? I think I would panic if someone innocently replied, "Oh no, I'm just studying! I'm just trying to remember what words to Google! What was that XX you just said?" It's okay to say something like that. Really.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638360935005061121] And if you attend a conference three times and say hello each time, you generally get to know each other. In other words, let's think of it as a three-way (??????). I'm sure you'll get to know each other.
> Don't expect to make a relationship with someone once, and don't expect them to remember your face! It's better to be as positive as you can be.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638362003764031488] And today

> so it looks like you can skip the three visits (????) once. is skipped once.
> (I am not the organizer of this meeting, but that is the purpose.)

> This is exactly what it is.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638367082676125698] "Let's present!" I really mean that, but if you've never been to a conference before (or if you've never been to a conference before), you may not know what the atmosphere is like, so I don't think you have to aim to present the first time around.
> but it is better to make an announcement to solve the problem at once.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638485277760184320] Well, I got some ideas from RTs and responses and everything! I was thinking,
> In other words, it's a lot of things, but I think it comes down to "Act!" I think it comes down to this.


>[kogetsu https://twitter.com/kogetsu/status/1638360738095038464] I think it's easiest to join or announce in [management].

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638361219718578176] The vitality to put in the management will usually solve the problem, but many people don't seem to have the motivation or guts to do so...

>[kogetsu https://twitter.com/kogetsu/status/1638372734848860160] I think it's more difficult to go there as a participant, because I don't feel like I have much value to give to the other person. I wonder if that's true.

>[uzulla https://twitter.com/uzulla/status/1638377433794740228] No, I totally understand that. However, people nowadays look at conferences as seminars, so it seems like a lot of work to organize them, and it seems like a high hurdle to provide value! It seems to me that there is a high hurdle to overcome.
> Of course there are commercial events like that, but you don't seem to know the difference.


>[y_taka_23 https://twitter.com/y_taka_23/status/1638925327320883201] Many people are saying that you should be a [speaker] in this conversation, but I see the issue in a slightly different way. Being a speaker gives you a chance to be "known by others" but it is hard to be a chance to "know others". The so-called acquaintance is "knowing that we know each other" and needs one more action.

> Maybe that's what they mean by getting to know each other as speakers...
