 *1397098967*U theory is interesting.
 I've been skimming through the U Theory book and this is pretty interesting.
 
 The PDCA cycle (Plan→Do→Evaluate→Improve) may seem convincing to those who are already in the cycle, but if you try it with someone who is not in the cycle, they may stop at "So, how do you make a plan? On the other hand, if you try to do it with someone who has not been doing it for a long time, he or she may stop because of the question "So, how do you make a plan?
 
 Whether it is the "hypothesis, experiment, test, revise" cycle of scientific thinking or the "high-speed hypothesis testing cycle" of Lean Startup, some people stumble when they actually try to do it.
 
 I have been saying "observation first" for problems that stumble before entering this kind of "cycle," but U Theory divides this part of the cycle into seven stages.
 
 The first is the stage in which you are looking at things according to preconceived notions, in other words, you are "not seeing. Next is the "seeing" stage, followed by the "looking closely" stage. Up to this point, it is like a breakdown of "observation first. Next is the stage at the bottom of the U-shape, and to enter this stage, you have to let go of your preconceived notions once. This is a state of identification with the problem without judgment, like Csikszentmihalyi's flow state or Kitaro Nishida's pure experience. The experience gathered through this process is crystallized in the next stage, and a new understanding is created. The next stage is prototyping based on this new understanding, and the stage after that is practice.
 
 The book is dedicated to how to take the first step (D) before the PDCA cycle begins to turn, when you don't yet have the material knowledge for the P.
