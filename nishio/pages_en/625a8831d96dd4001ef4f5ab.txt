Kozaneba as a process leading to enlightenment
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472085955368878081]: half jokingly read "Kozaneba Shugyo", but I'll go walking thinking about whether this is training or not, get some sun while it's bright!

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472087848006582273]: the word "shugyo" came about under the influence of the term "actual practice" of Zen meditation as a process leading to enlightenment, but it's not samatha or vippasana. It's more like sweeping the precincts of the temple or something. But cleaning the precincts is the repetition of the same thing every day, whereas [Kozaneba] is always "what you don't yet understand, what you don't yet have the words for.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472088232288722944]: for the subject, the same is not repeated. The understanding here is Eugene Gendlin's [COMPREHENSION], so it is closely related to what we put into words

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472089533990961154]: In order to obtain something that has not yet been put into words, I first accept the symbols as they are, without distorting them with my interpretation, and continue to manipulate them, I feel that I am doing something different from my daily life in this process. I wonder if it is similar to "Shomikaze".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472090876940005381]: hmmm, I think it's more of a scientist mindset than a purpose to improve oneself through practice. I want to know how the phenomenon of understanding is happening. So I bring a document that I can't understand by reading it diagonally, and observe the process of my understanding it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472091582384209920]: it is preferable to be externalized to observe. The reason is that human temporary memory is easily broken, so if you do a "let's take a walk and think about something else" like I'm doing right now while reading a difficult text, it will be broken. Putting the thought process outside the brain allows it to resume without breaking when interrupted.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472092311375204358]: I started using this externalization of thoughts 7 years ago? I started using the KJ method after I came across it 7 years ago, so I read it as "KJ method", but it seems to be different from the way the world uses the term "KJ method". It is more like the Kozane method, but that is not appropriate either. I'm trying to deal with the inconvenience of the experience I've had with paper by digitizing it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472092756877389828]: grouping -> Regroup -> Kozaneba and I have made it. So the closest word to describe this process is "[using Kozaneba]". I guess the abbreviation is "[Kozaneba training]".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472095542495031296]: The reason why I don't feel comfortable with the word [shugyo] is because I can't relate to the idea that the purpose of shugyo in Buddhism and other religions is "to free oneself from negative feelings about the non-permanence of one's biological existence by merging with a permanent being. I want to be free from such negative feelings by merging with a permanent existence.

The collection of information on the Internet is rather closer to the feeling that it is my body. So every step I take in putting my thoughts into the Internet like this is "living my life",

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472098718904360961]: For example, cleaning the body by taking a bath is like vacuuming the filter of an air purifier: "I don't want to do it, but if I don't do it, the performance will suffer. It's like vacuuming the filter of an air purifier.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472099859746664448]: there is a place on the internet where I have a compilation of my writing, but it is not a body, merely a tool that facilitates access There is a feeling that it is not a body. Just recently I saw some of my slides cut out and circulated under no name, and strangely I didn't feel angry or "taken".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472101718435721216]: the feeling that "it is a natural physical law in this world that such things happen".
>Good things are copied and often distorted in the copying process.
>In that sense, it's interesting that you don't feel like your stuff is being taken away from you, but rather that it's a waste of information.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472102728923226114]: Let's say you have a tree that produces delicious fruit. You take the fruit and bring it with you, but after you eat it, that's it.
>It is more valuable to know where the tree is located, and even better to take a branch and plant it in your own garden to grow it if possible.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472104027538489344]: But even if the source has been cut or distorted, the search engines know all about it, so they can look it up. But even if the sources are abridged and distorted, the search engines know everything, so they can look it up.

	[A moment of sitting is worth a moment of Buddha's time]

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472106170215444483]: I was walking around tweeting on my phone and my hands got cold, my protein body is totally clunky and not good, I can't wait to get a brain implant so I can just think! I want to be able to do internet just by thinking.
