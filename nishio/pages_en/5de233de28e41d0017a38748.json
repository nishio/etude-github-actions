Live Photos
The [iPhone] camera has the ability to "save a video of 1500msec before and after the time the shutter was pressed in relation to the [photo]".

I couldn't find any information on the resolution by googling, so I looked it up.
	Download from iCloud and it comes down as a ZIP with HEIC and MOV.
	HEIC is 3024 × 4032
	MOV is 1440 × 1920

The resolution is rather low.
	see [iPhone11ProMax camera resolution].
