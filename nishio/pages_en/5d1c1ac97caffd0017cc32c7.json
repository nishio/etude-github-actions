An example of how Scrapbox connects the past
	Write [useless] (2019-07-03)
		When a person says that a method is "useless," it is sometimes due to a lack of ability on his/her part.
	Think about it, "It's the same when you say to another person, 'You're a poor communicator.'"
	I think I've written about this before, I'll search but can't find it.
	Making [poor communication skills].
	I'll search for the word "commie" as I come up with it.
	Unexpected hits: [Selfish is an attribute of directed edges](2018-01-06)
	I realize that the "vertex attributes or edge attributes" perspective discussed here is the common composition of all three examples.
	This should be on a separate page.
	Create [vertex attribute or edge attribute].
	Link suggestions by "attribute" found [attribute of relationship rather than stand-alone attribute](2019-01-24)
		Writing on the same day [jigsaw puzzle instead of scalar] has little to do with the content of this issue.
			I'm a little short on words when I reread it in light of "vertex attributes or edge attributes," and "single attributes or relationship attributes."
			No written description of scalar-like growth.
