Sun Yat-sen's carriage
The strategy proposed by Sun Yat-sen during the horse race between Tian Xia and Wei Wang of Qi in the Histories.
Put your slowest horse against your opponent's fastest horse, your intermediate horse against your opponent's slowest horse, your fastest horse against your opponent's intermediate horse

Why is this a win-win?
 Winning points have a [non-linear] nature where one win counts as one win, even if you win big and win small
 Two small wins +1 and a big loss -2, for a total of 0, but a win point win by 1 with 2 wins and 1 loss as victory points.
