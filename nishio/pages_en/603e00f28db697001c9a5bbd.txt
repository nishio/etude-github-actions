　[Zoom in to see the whole picture when the editor loads].
　 After loading, the canvas display area is now calculated from the content "so that the entire content fits on the canvas" at the time of the first drawing.
　If you start with a blank sheet of paper, there is no "drawing after loading", so the drawing after the first path is the first drawing.
　The coordinate system is set so that the first drawing is in the center.
