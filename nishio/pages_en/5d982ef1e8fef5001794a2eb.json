In the beginning, we would release the video as soon as it was ready and immediately announce it on social networking sites,
Recently, we have been delaying the timing of announcements on social networking sites and observing changes in behavior as a result.
An experiment at about 7 hours timing was to "reply to someone else's Tweet".

I thought the timing of about 14 hours was my Facebook announcement, but I guess not.

	Therefore, we conclude that the rapid increase in views was due to the high click-through rate from Twitter impressions.
	Although this experiment succeeded in increasing views as expected, it did little to increase the number of channel subscribers, which is our long-term goal, so we will probably not pursue this route in the future.
