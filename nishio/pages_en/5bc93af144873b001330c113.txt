GTD and KJ method
The process of my realization of the relationship between GTD and the KJ method is quite detailed and interesting to log.

	I first read about GTD in 2007.
  According to Amazon, I bought both [First GTD] and [One More GTD] on 7/8/2011.
 I hadn't read it in seven years because of an interview in 2014.
 	[Without a deadline, you run toward a very distant goal that you will never reach.]
 I learned about the KJ method in 2011.
 He stressed the importance of "bottom up" in explaining the KJ method back in 2014
 By reading back on GTD, I realized that GTD also has a common mindset.

>I re-read [GTD] for the first time in years and found unexpected things. There are so many similarities with the [KJ method] model.
>Well, that was seven years ago... I should have reviewed it more closely.
>I didn't realize that GTD also emphasizes "bottom-up", which I have been emphasizing in my lectures.

We believe that this realization must be communicated in language. The process is summarized in [Languaging the Analogy between GTD and the KJ Method].

Fragments of the ideas that emerged at this time will be utilized in various parts of [The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production] in 2017.
