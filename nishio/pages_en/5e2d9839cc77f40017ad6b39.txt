Preparing for the demonstration
	Smooth flow of editing link with QR code, and then the person who took the picture can try it out on their iPhone and write it down.

	[Do we need unframed text?"]
	[I don't think the group needs a nameplate.]

	Ability to move in and out of groups after groups are created.
　The inability to do this now has made me resistant to forming groups.
　Would it be better if we could pick a group and "demolish" it?
　The question is what to do with the nameplate sticky note.
　Need to enter the nameplate again the next time it is grouped.
　If you want to do some serious demolition, that's fine.
　When you want to add to a group, "take it apart, delete the nameplate, select the lasso including the sticky you want to add, and re-enter the nameplate" is not possible as a hassle.
　No nameplate is better than no nameplate.

 		Adding and Deleting to and from Groups
 		[Drag stickies in a group to move them in and out and rearrange them.]
 			If a group does not open when you drag-drop into a closed group, you can create a trash group, for example, and put unwanted items into it as you go.
 		[When you want to create a group, the nameplate for that group already exists].

 	No way to open the middle heading.

 		This is because the function to change the position of stickies by dragging within a group or move them out of the group is not yet implemented.

	>When I group stickies, I am prompted to enter the nameplate name, but the text of the previously entered sticky is still there.

		TODO: This is another bug
			I'd prefer a placeholder.
			I'm beginning to think it's not a good idea to force people to name their nameplates.
				Better to have a nameplate, especially when grouping paths, but I was thinking a thumbnail would be fine.



	Parallel move with two finger gesture on iPad -> do the same thing on Mac and it zooms.
		This is because two-finger gestures are not implemented on the PC, and the Mac default function maps two-finger up/down to wheel events.

	The phenomenon of short dots remaining as garbage
		I'm assuming that Simplify for too short paths is causing some vertices to be NaN or something.
			Only one stroke of a Chinese character can be trashed.
			Short paths do not need to be Simplified in the first place.


	UNDOing a delete will UNDO one path at a time.
		I think I've implemented UNDO unit control.
		how?

 Images can be put on gyazo now, even if it means OCR.
		Images have low priority.
	 I hope you can write it down with a scribbler's picture on it.
