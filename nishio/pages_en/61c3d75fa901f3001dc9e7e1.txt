Productivity in two ways
>Those who measure "[productivity]" in terms of "[production per unit time]," which has nothing to do with humans, force humans to work long hours in order to increase productivity, while those who measure it in terms of "[production per unit working hours]," which is the human standard, believe that people should take proper rest because long working hours reduce productivity.
