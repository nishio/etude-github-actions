Footnote 23 for (5.2.3.1) Flow of KJ method
If we can determine the "[relationship likelihood]" between labels mechanically, we can mechanically generate spatial composition, for example, by using the [self-organizing map] algorithm proposed by artificial neural network researcher [Teuvo Kohonen]. The algorithm maps from high-dimensional space to 2-dimensional space keeping the distance between items. Also, an algorithm [word2vec] proposed by Google researcher [Mikolov et al.] in 2013 embed the meaning of words and short sentences into vector space. The advance of those technologies may make the computer possible to support the spatial layout of the [KJ method] in the future.
