	Problem with words such as "OKR" and "MBR" being broken into new lines
		I really want three letters side by side.

		[Automatic font size adjustment for stickies]
	English words try to avoid folding as much as possible.
	But if you don't wrap it, the font could be very small.
		So, if it is a "wrap-around character all the way from the beginning of the line", I'm going to wrap it.
		The result is only three characters, but it's folded.

	OKR" is broken into "→/OKR" because "→" is not alphabetic and the line should be broken here.
