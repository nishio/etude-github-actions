[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "clear" is that "clear"?
I'm [/nishio/human.icon]kind of fuzzy-headed, and I'm not feeling refreshed or comfortable at the monitor, so I'm hoping to get out of it, so I'm taking a walk and consulting with you.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about that "refreshing"?
[/nishio/human.icon]I don't want to make progress working properly in an uncluttered state, I want to be crisp and clear.
