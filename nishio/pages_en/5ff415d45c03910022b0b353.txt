Sharpen particles and conjugations (manual work, would like to support this mechanically as well).
code::
	me
 What we're working on now
 Lots and lots of atoms.
 often
 Multiple components
 Depends on one atom
 There are components that depend on multiple atoms.
 Change atom
 I want to redraw only some components.
 The Recoil Approach
 Looks like it fits very well.

code::
 input
 I'm used to making short stickies, or shortening a long sentence, but people aren't used to it, so they put in long sentences and make "stickies that are too small to read".
 
	expected output
 me
 Make a short sticky note
 Chop what you've written in long sentences into shorter ones.
 I'm used to it.
 worldling
 I'm not used to it.
 I'd put it in a long sentence.
 Sticky note with letters too small to read
 I'll make it.

This is a failure in the engage analysis.
