 *1245848123*Herb + Cola
 An annual herb in the same family as mint and lemon balm, it has broad oval leaves that emit a distinctive fragrance when they are crushed. It is said to have the power to revive the dying, and in its native region it is named for its unique color and medicinal properties. Its scientific name is Perilla frutescens var. crispa.
