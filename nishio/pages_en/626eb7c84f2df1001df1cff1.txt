Clarify the final decision-making mechanism regarding expenditures
It is not good to delay action due to lack of clarity on the final decision-making mechanism on spending
　Specifically, I didn't know if it was two AND's or OR's, and there was a wait to see if one of them OK'd and then had to wait for the other one to OK.
　Clarified to be "or."
　However, if the payment method is unprecedented, it is necessary to confirm whether it is administratively feasible or not
　　Example
　　　Tried to subsidize travel expenses for creators coming from outside the country under the guise of part-time work.
　　　but middle school students are not allowed to work part-time except as child actors and newspaper delivery
　　　→After discussion, it was concluded that "travel expense support with a cap" would be straightforward.
