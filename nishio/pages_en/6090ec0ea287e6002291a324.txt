 *1431096320*I guess I like Yuki.
 I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&field-keywords=%E7%B5%90% E5%9F%8E%E6%B5%A9&linkCode=ur2&rh=n%3A465392%2Ck%3A%E7%B5%90%E5%9F%8E%E6%B5%A9&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks ">I guess I like Hiroshi Yuki</a>. His "<a href='http://www.hyuki.com/writing/writing.html'>Mindset for Writing</a>" has helped me many times when I do my own writing. I like the sincerity that is sometimes evident in his diaries and other writings, in which he strives to deliver something better to his readers. I used to dislike all things religious, but as I read his diary as a devout Christian, my dislike has lessened. After all, there are good people and bad people in every group.
 
 So how do we deal with bad people, the philosopher born in 1601<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/? _encoding=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&field-keywords=%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B6%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B0 83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3&linkCode=ur2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks">Balthazar Gracian</a> says.

 Ignore people's slander. It is wise to respond with silence. Do not appeal to the power of the pen to clear your name. What is written will remain forever, so instead of punishing your enemies, you are helping them to keep your name. There is no revenge better than oblivion.

 I see...400 years have passed, but human society hasn't changed much, has it?
 
 
 Life time is finite and a precious resource. Therefore, "whether it is beneficial to my life" is a more useful criterion than "whether it is objectively correct. You cannot read every book and judge whether it is good or bad. When I judge from a person's past behavior that he/she is a good person, an invisible resource called "trust" is created.
 
 For example, I have encountered Eijiro Sumii's explanations of functional languages several times in the process of learning functional languages, and although his writing is not always easy to understand (sorry if I offended you), I felt his sincerity in trying to convey the concepts correctly. That experience has given me a positive trust in Mr. Sumii as well.
 
 On the other hand, if a new person who has not accumulated such trust appears and writes, for example, a blog entry that does not look very good to me, or if he speaks out against those whom I have trust in, he will accumulate negative trust from me. And I will believe the opinions of those I place positive trust in and ignore the opinions of those I place negative trust in, unless I feel the need to "scrutinize it myself to determine if it is correct or not. My life is a finite and precious resource.
 
 Whether you call this kind of thinking authoritarianism or achievement-oriented, such a labeling debate is not beneficial to my life. To me, this way of thinking is a branch of philosophy "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&field -keywords=%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B0%E3%83%9E%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A0&linkCode=ur2&rh=n%3A465392%2Ck%3A%E3%83%97%E3 83%A9%E3%82%B0%E3%83%9E%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A0&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks">pragmatism</a>.
 
 
 Now, what is the purpose of this article? Some may see it as a positive statement, "I hope that many people will benefit from this article by spreading the word about a concept that I think is beneficial," while others may see it as a negative statement, "He is just promoting his own book. Let's just say it here. This entry was written to promote his own book! (Doo-doo!)
 
 My book "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/477415654X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=477415654X& linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">The Technology Behind Coding</a>" is a book about the syntax of various languages and what kind of problems they were created to solve, and how to learn how to solve them by considering the problem consciousness of language designers and comparing several languages that have made different design decisions. Of the 10 customer reviews, 4 gave it 5 stars, 5 gave it 4 stars, and 1 gave it 3 stars, out of 10 customer reviews, 4 were 5 stars, 5 were 4 stars, 1 was 3 stars, and none were 2 stars or 1 star. That's great. (Self-praise).
 
 In fact, this book had chapters on philosophy and business administration in Chapter 0 at the planning stage. However, we decided that it would not be good to leave readers behind with too much abstraction from the very beginning, so we cut it out. Later, when it was decided that a column was needed to fill the page margins, part of the chapter was reused. The column was more popular than expected, and in response to reader feedback that they would love to read more, it was written as a special Web+DB Press article, "<a href='http://gihyo.jp/lifestyle/feature/01/engineer-studying'> How Engineers Learn</a>". It is now available on the Web.
 
 The article's popularity led to the launch of a series of Cybozu-style "<a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/search.html?tag=%E7%B6%9A%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8 %E3%83%8B%E3%82%A2%E3%81%AE%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%B3%E6%96%B9'>The Way Engineers Learn</a>". The series will resume next week after a four-month break due to editorial reasons.
 
 Also, expanding on this special article, the author gave a <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20140918/1411009426'>keynote speech</a> at PyCon JP 2014. This keynote was a bit too abstract. Therefore, I started a series of articles in <a href='http://gihyo.jp/magazine/wdpress/archive/2015/vol86'>WEB+DB PRESS Vol. 86</a>, which was recently released, to try to put it into more concrete terms. The title of the series is "Let's Change Perspectives. It was a challenging experiment to publish an article in a technical magazine that incorporates a business administration perspective. We are looking forward to seeing what kind of response we will get.
 
 Okay, I've finished promoting my book at one point! You are free to trust me or not.
