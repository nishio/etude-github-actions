[Observation] and [judgment]
xlix Observation and judgment.

He who has these rules is the thing, not he. He rings the profound abyss at once. He is a phrenologist by physiognomy. If he sees a person, he understands him and judges his essence. From the slightest observation, he deciphers the most hidden depths of a person's true nature. Through keen observation, subtle insight, and wise reasoning, he discovers, realizes, grasps, and understands everything.
