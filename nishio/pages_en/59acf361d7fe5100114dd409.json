Difference between Bachelor and Master
I was chatting with someone who was interviewing for a position and it was interesting, so I made a note of it.

Many bachelor's (undergraduate) students talk about "what they did" when I tell them to talk about "[their] contribution" of what they did in college.
Many masters (master's degree) can talk about that in a separate way.
