Minimum mathematical knowledge required for machine learning
Q: What is the minimum mathematical knowledge required for [machine learning]?
A: I don't see why someone who simply uses a library would need mathematical knowledge.

Q: Don't say that...

So brainstorm what knowledge is needed for people who just use the library.
Move up what looks important.

scientific methodology
 Proper experimentation and observation of experimental results.
 If it is not disprovable, it is occult.
 I was able to identify them with 90% accuracy using the Deeper Plugin!"
  We should check and compare more basic methods to see how accurate they are.
  Using Deep Learning to achieve 90% accuracy on a problem where logistic regression gives a 92% system is just stupid.

[dimensional analysis https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AC%A1%E5%85%83%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90]
 Do not add different units.
 70% plus 60 kg equals 130!" is no good.
 With a metaphor like this, you think, "You wouldn't do that, would you?"
 But there are a surprising number of people who do things like "add the number of pieces and the probability" without a hitch.

Explanatory and Objective Variables
 To talk about whether there is labeled data or not, we need to understand what labels are in the first place.

graph
 Graph reading is required.
 A histogram would be absolutely necessary.
 And scatter plots?
 Do you also have a box-and-whisker diagram?

Basic Statistics
 average
  Mean, median, and mode are different.
 Variance and standard deviation
		What is the probability of how many standard deviations and how much
 What happens to the variance when the amount of data doubles?

[scale level https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B0%BA%E5%BA%A6%E6%B0%B4%E6%BA%96]
	This could be bad if you don't know what you're doing.
 Don't feed nominal scale data to a library that wants interval scales, or something like that.

Concepts of space in more than 3 dimensions
 Some people think of vectors as arrows in a two-dimensional plane or in three-dimensional space, and when you get to four or more dimensions, they think, "Time axis?" Some people get like.

vector
	It's just a string of numbers!

matrix
	It's just a two-dimensional array!
 You don't do matrix operations or anything like that.

differential (e.g. calculus)
	A working person who is not good at math will not be able to do it after reading one lukewarm article.
 You can understand that and use the library instead of implementing it yourself, it's faster.
 If you want to implement a multilayer perceptron from scratch yourself, or if you want to know how a multilayer perceptron works, you need to learn.
 I would suggest reading a first year college calculus textbook or something like that.
  Read a linear algebra textbook on matrices as well.

log rule

normal distribution

Curse of the dimension
	I want you to have a sense that a large dimensional space is a bad idea.
	But even if I don't have a sense of dimensionality, I feel like I could just say, "We need a lot of data."

probability
 Do we need it?
 I would need basic probability and Bayes rule to understand what's in the naive Bayesian.
 But there's something in the documentation about how to use it differently.
 >Like MultinomialNB, this classifier is suitable for discrete data. The difference is that while MultinomialNB works with occurrence counts, BernoulliNB is designed for binary/boolean features.
