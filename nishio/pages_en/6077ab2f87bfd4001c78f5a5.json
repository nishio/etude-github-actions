Independence means more dependents.
>When I was a full-time university faculty member, I had the feeling that my career would be ruined if the power-hungry elders around me didn't like me, but once I started writing books and taking analysis jobs on my own, I felt more comfortable saying, "Well, at worst I can quit. I think this is a good example of how independence means increasing one's dependence on others.
>On the other hand, power-harassers tend to tell young people to "focus on one thing," which is a rational thing to say in that it increases their influence if there is no escape route. At the very least, "one thing" should be a personal mission, not a position, and you can do any number of jobs that lead to that mission as long as they are within your capacity.
