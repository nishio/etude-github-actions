　Thoughts.
　　I get partial points for N=20, but why are the restrictions so loose?
　　You say the range of monotonically increasing and monotonically decreasing is a mountain, so why not just take one lick from the head to the other?
　Official Explanation
　　I was getting to the full score solution no-stop.
　　The assumption was "O(N) for all three pairs, resulting in O(N^4)"
