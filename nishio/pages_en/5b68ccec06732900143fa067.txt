Speed up from the point where the time consumption ratio is large.
	Minor acceleration
 For example, in an editor, it is faster to jump with search than to use the cursor keys to move the cursor.
 	For example, if you want to move the cursor to the "n" position in the string abcde..., you can do it with two touches of `Ctrl-s n` in Emacs.
 That in itself is true if you only focus on that narrow area, but how much of your life is spent moving the cursor?
	Pre-optimization profiling
 Compare the time you spend moving your cursor, looking for your missing smartphone, or reading a news article you don't really want to read as an escape from a task you know in your head you have to do but don't feel like doing.
