Chasm and Population
>[tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1419039949685362691]: I got a comment on this diagram
>[Doesn't the [chasm] diagram assume that the population distribution is uniform?
>[In the demographic bonus period], there are many young people, many in front of the chasm, and therefore new businesses will flourish.
>[Population ous period] has more elderly people, more behind the chasm, hence more conservative companies, more difficult for new businesses.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1419139696760745990]: The original chasm is merely a normal distribution sliced by standard deviation to determine population ratios, so the horizontal axis is meaningless, but if you assign a concept like "new innovation If you assign a concept like "hiring trends", then of course that trend and age don't seem to be independent.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1419145595906707459]: not a simple composition of age only, but "people who saw it for the first time" appreciate it more highly than it really is and get excited, and "people who have seen something similar in the past" are subsequently disillusioned The image of stepping on the brake after remembering the period

>And when you get caught up in [pessimistic misconceptions], you can't get out of it because it inhibits you from "trying," and over time people move from optimism to pessimism.
>If a certain balance is optimal, then a society that has increased its life expectancy from that point is overly pessimistic. Is this what you meant to say?

>[tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1419159672477536256]: ...... that doesn't have to be forcibly explained by hype cycles, the human capacity to learn You're assuming too much that the human capacity to learn doesn't change throughout life.
>It's usually explained adequately by a decrease in curiosity [due to aging] and a decrease in the ability to learn,
> Conversely, at younger ages, in addition to the reverse of the above, idiosyncratic consumption activities are associated with sex appeal

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1419167804121518087]: It is true that the ability to learn new things declines with age, but I think that in addition, "[disregard for new things]" is causing the behavior of "not devoting resources to learning it," and that has a significant impact. I think that the "disregard" and "sadness" of the "disregard" and "sadness" are the main reasons for the decline in the ability to learn new things with age. And what causes this "disregard" and "pessimism" and "[learned helplessness]"?

>[tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1419170605971034114]: I think I can roughly explain it in terms of sex appeal
>Because in human society "[adaptability to the new]" appears to be an indicator of sexual excellence,
>As the need to appeal for sex disappears, the ability to learn is reduced

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1419173693469589506]: hmmm. I think that hypothesis is a bit overstated when you consider, for example, whether people who enthusiastically tinkered with computers in the early days of computers thought that it would lead to sexual appeal to the opposite sex, or whether it did in fact lead to sexual appeal.
>It's an observable fact that there are small wealthy first generation men who study youth culture to attract the attention of young women.
