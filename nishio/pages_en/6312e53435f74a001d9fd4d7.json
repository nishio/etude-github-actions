Japanese speakers give low ratings in reviews, so they don't sell in Japan.
OLD TITLE: [Japanese speaker] will not implement Japanese version because [Japanese speaker] will give a low rating in [review] and [product value] will decrease.

[https://togetter.com/li/1938934 Are Japanese people becoming more and more avoided by other countries because they are quick to give low ratings and make crazy claims in reviews? - Togetter]

> The fact that Stable Diffusion and midjourney did not get flamed for the function of giving reference images and having them generated, and mimic, which was more considerate to the artists in its terms and conditions, got flamed (for being a wet blanket), does this not set a precedent that "it is better to cut off people below a certain level of knowledge by making the service English-only"? I don't want to live in such a world. I don't want to live in such a world.

> I sometimes hear from developers on Steam or Appstore that they deliberately don't implement Japanese language because Japanese speakers will immediately give low ratings in reviews and the value of the product will drop. And they say it is difficult to sell apps and games made by Japanese people because they are generally rated low. They are a peculiar people who dig their own graves.

> I know this very well as I work part-time in China in promotion. Japanese people would lower their review ratings, and there were a lot of bizarre complaints, and quite a few times people said they wanted to get rid of Japanese people or didn't want to sell to Japanese people. Even if there is nothing wrong with the product, they are giving 1 star for box damage during shipping, and they are becoming the hated people in the world.
> In addition, Japanese people seem to be getting poorer for sure, and the price per purchase is obviously lower than customers from other countries.
> This is one of the main reasons why we are no longer dealing with Japan.
