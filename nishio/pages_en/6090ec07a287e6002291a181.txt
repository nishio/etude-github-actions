 *1306241044*Nikoli's Ripple Effect Day 2
 I wrote in a recent <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110514/1305384332'>Nikoli's Ripple Effect</a>.
 >>
 What is the minimum size that would determine the answer if we created a space of 9 3x3 squares and initially placed no numbers at all?
 
 In the case of 2x2, and I realized that it is quite a pain to describe the shape in a blog after writing this much
 <<
 A continuation of the story. However, I have not yet written a script to make it easier to see on the blog, so I don't think it would get much of a response even if I did. (It's not that I haven't written any scripts, it's just that I haven't done anything until today, and I suddenly had an idea during my lunch break and noticed something interesting when I was writing on a piece of paper.)
 
 To begin with, "What is the smallest size, uniquely determined without a clue, that contains a 2 x 2 space?" is too big a question. Let's start from the smallest. "Is there a way to divide an n x m puzzle that is uniquely determined without clues?"
 
 1×1 has it, of course; 1×2 has only two ways of division, with AA the solution is not uniquely determined (hereafter "indefinite"), with AB there is no solution (hereafter "impossible"), 1×3 is uniquely determined by the division of ABB; 2×2 has no determined division; 2×3, after a little thought (and a good puzzle), a division exists I found that there is a division for 2×3. Then I thought a lot about 2×4 and could not find a division, but I could not prove that it does not exist because I did not enumerate the divisions myself to make sure I did not leave anything out.
 
 On the train ride home, I gave up on 2×4 for now and considered 3×3. There's a split on this one; there's a 3×4; there's a 3×5; there's a 3×4; there's a 3×5. Huh? Maybe it's easier to find if one side is odd? So I tried 4×4. Once I had a detour to my initial goal of trying to "include an empty square of 2 x 2" and failed, but I found a division for this one, too.
 
 Also, I was explaining this problem to a friend and I noticed that 1xn has the division ABBCC....ZZ when n is odd. ZZ when n is odd. (Added on 25th: This is wrong. After the ABB part of ABBCC becomes 121, CC can be 21 or 12, which violates the constraint. Well, this is easy to understand if you write a program because the enumeration of division is simple.
 
 Notes on unsolved problems (probably in order of difficulty)
 - What is the smallest even number n with a partition uniquely determined by 1 × n?
 - Is the expectation that "there is no uniquely determined division method for a 2x4" correct?
 - Is the expectation that "there exists a partition that is always uniquely determined if it is large enough (3 x 3 or larger)" correct?
 - What is the smallest puzzle that contains a 2x2 room? (Added on 25th: I can make a puzzle that satisfies the condition 5x5)
 - What is the smallest puzzle containing a 3x3 room?
 
 Note that so far I have checked everything with pen and paper and visually, so I cannot deny the possibility that there are some mistakes. It would be more interesting to try to come up with your own example of division, but if you don't write it down, I'll forget about it.
