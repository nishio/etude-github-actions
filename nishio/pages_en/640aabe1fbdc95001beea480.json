What is one trait that young Steve Jobs felt was common to "great people"? It was quite surprising that he would say this.
This video's "don't change your attitude depending on the person you are talking to" reminded me that when I was having a drink with Tony, the founder of Zappos, in San Francisco once, he said, "I want to meet as many people from different worlds as I can. And I want to be someone who can understand their values," he said humbly.

I didn't know this, but it's so important... (Maybe that's why I feel a certain freshness in chatGPT, because "they always answer my questions seriously"...)
there are no stupid questions, only stupid answers.
