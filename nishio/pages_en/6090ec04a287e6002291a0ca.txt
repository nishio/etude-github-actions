 *1277019980*Tweets about sensitivity and theory
 Reprinted from Twitter, 6/17~18.

 @sijyo_no_oteire Why should sensitivity come before theory and methodology? Because if your sensitivity cannot identify when and what kind of theory or methodology to use, no matter how much theory or methodology you have, you will never know when to use it, and it will be a waste of treasure. Even if you know a recipe, it is no good if you have no sense of taste. Furthermore, like a recipe, there is not a method for every dish.

 When you're choosing theories and methodologies based on sensitivity, you're screwing up.

 For me, "sensitivity" is something that cannot be taught, learned, or accumulated, while "theory" can be taught, learned, and accumulated. If I were to compare them to a monkey and a banana, sensitivity is the jumping ability and theory is the springboard box. You jump from the top of a pile, not from the top of a pile after you jump.

 If you want to do something no one has done yet, i.e., get a banana that hasn't been taken yet, you can't just jump without stacking boxes. There are no more bananas where you can reach them that way, because countless numbers of monkeys have done it in the past thousands of years.

 Of course, it does not mean that either opinion is correct, but rather that the terms "sensitivity" and "theory" are not clearly defined. And if you agree with my definition that "sensitivity cannot be built up," then you can draw the conclusion from that that "a stance that emphasizes sensitivity over theory does not produce anything new.

 @tcsh Replace it with insight based on experience RT @nishio: You're screwing up when you're choosing theories and methodologies based on sensitivity.

 I have defined "sensitivity" as something that cannot be communicated to others and cannot be accumulated, and "theory" as something that can be communicated to others and can be accumulated. However, there are other things in the world as well. For example, if you learn how to ride a bicycle, it is not something that can be conveyed to others through words, nor is it something that you can learn to ride a bicycle just by having it conveyed to you through words. And if you can't ride a bicycle, you probably can't ride a motorcycle or an acrobatic bicycle. In other words, it cannot be communicated to others and built up.
 
 According to my definition, this kind of "non-verbalized experiential knowledge" is categorized as "neither sensitivity nor theory," but it is also possible to call "non-verbalized experiential knowledge" "sensitivity" and to call what I call sensitivity "sense.

 @Nikoriks Wasn't it Edison who invented a way to get bananas to his minion monkeys @nishio There are no bananas where you can reach them that way anymore.

 Indeed, "I must take the banana by myself" is nothing more than an assumption. Drucker also said, "The greatest achievement in the history of technology in the 19th century was the invention of invention. From invention by floundering geniuses to invention by systematic development and research units." (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4478000646?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& creativeASIN=4478000646">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Drucker's Famous Books)</a>) and we must not forget the possibility that working as an organization makes it easier to reach bananas than working alone. I had completely forgotten about that. I guess I lack an organizational perspective.
