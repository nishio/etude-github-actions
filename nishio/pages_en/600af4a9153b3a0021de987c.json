I am an imposter!
[Imposter Syndrome].
If the problem is that you are an imposter and you feel guilty because you feel like you are cheating people, then I thought, why not just declare "I am an imposter! I am an imposter!

　If indeed it is an imposter,
　　I'm being honest and stating that I'm an imposter.
　　So I'm not deceiving you.
　　No more reason to feel guilty.
　If not an imposter
　　It is not correct to declare that he is an Imposter.
　　But he's lying, but he's lying in the direction of his own loss.
　　I'm not causing others to lose money.
　　There's no reason to feel guilty because you're reaping the rewards of your own incorrect representations.

I got the idea from the drama, The Umbrella Academy, where the character who was feted as the guru of a new religion confessed in front of his followers, "I am a fraud."
