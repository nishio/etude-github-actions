　Thoughts.
　　The answer can be obtained by sorting pairs of starting point and +1, and ending point and -1, and accumulating them from the beginning and taking the maximum value.
　　　Even if they're covered by the same value, the -1 comes first, so no fraudulently large value is created.
　　200,000 O(NlogN), so I think you'll be fine.
　　　[Estimated computational complexity].
　　　Hmmm, it still looks like you can afford it.
　Official Explanation
　　Officials use the 1000000 sequence, but yikes.
　　I wonder if my solution method is equivalent to [coordinate compression] and [imosu method].
