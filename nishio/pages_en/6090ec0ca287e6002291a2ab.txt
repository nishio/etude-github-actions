 In the recent "<a href='http://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-18540949'>How to Learn What? </a>", I wrote about how to grow from concrete knowledge to abstract knowledge. So how can we efficiently input that concrete knowledge? This second chapter answers that.
 
 In my book "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/477415654X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=477415654X& linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Techniques Supporting Coding</a>" is written in the form of columns scattered in the margins. However, after writing it, I found that the technique of "sutra copying" was misunderstood more than I expected due to the meaning of the word, and I was worried that the strict limitation of the number of characters and lack of words might contribute to the misunderstanding, so I decided to supplement it in the slides.
