Not "0 to 1" but "undefined to 0."
	The expressions "[0→1]" and "[1→100]" are on the same number line, which is strange.
	I find "undefined to 0" more satisfying.
	If it reaches 0, it can be incrementally improved "+1".
	If you do "+1" with undefined, it becomes NaN and you are stuck in a ditch you can't get out of.
