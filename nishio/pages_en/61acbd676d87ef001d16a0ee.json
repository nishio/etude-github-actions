WheatSeedsSystem development memo
　✅[Cactus Arm and Flowers]
　　I want to allow users to create cactus-like flowers with different textures.
　✅[Laptop, Desktop and Keyboard]

　 INFOBAR
　  https://www.au.com/mobile/product/featurephone/infobarxv/
　 AirPods and AT headphones
　 glasses
　 mug
　 　The mugs should be released in independent packs with different colors & customizable textures.
　 On the Chairs thread, "Do you have a desk?" I was asked, I have a few, but...
　✅[Colorful Chairs]
　✅[Mechanism for combining multiple resource packs].
　✅[Umbrella Pack]
	✅Lights
　Wall Lights
　　This will add some other lights to the light series.
　　Light series, rather fun to make, so maybe we can package it first.
　　I don't know why the flicker is happening, I don't understand the principle.
　✅[Diagonal Blocks]
　✅[Customizable books]
　　✅I'm only taking care of the front cover right now, but I'd like to take care of the spine and back cover too.
　　I want different sizes and thicknesses.
　　I wish I could build a bookshelf.
　　　Like a model with about three books stacked on top of each other.
　Desks
　　✅ Glass desk
　　Some wooden desks... ✅
　traditional (Chinese or Japanese) dry landscape garden
　　I was thinking that if I leveled the panel, I could make it into a carpet.
　　Even if you make a shining floor, it can only be used for that.
　　It would be interesting to create a karesansui unit.
　　Only ✅beds made, no stones.

　Invisible Holes
　 ✅ Dirt and stone with no hit points
	✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅
　[Customizable panels]
　　Things associated with white
　　Edges need better UV mapping of textures
　　If you get a brick block texture at an angle, it'll look like a roof.
　　　The sides and intersections are problematic, though.
　　　Diagonal panels can be put up in Experimental or
　　Arrows on sample

　[Customizable monitors]
　　Laptops should also be texture-switchable.
　　That's after releasing the one we have now.
　　Attach low-resolution textures?
　　Finish the release at the minimum.
　　　Black, Blue, Micra
　　Desk monitors, conference room monitors, wall monitors
　Anything not included so far?
　　Reception monitor and videoconferencing system monitor
　　　Is this another display series?
　　　I'm not willing to change it so I can customize the screen, so I'll mix it up with the Laptop pack.

　　Meeting Booth
　　　I don't think I want it because it's not good enough.
　　I have a misc pack made.
