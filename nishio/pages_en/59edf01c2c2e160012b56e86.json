Inheritance of helplessness

 I think there are a lot of adults who, whether implicitly or explicitly, give off an aura of "you can't do it" when a child tries something they have tried and failed at, or something they have never tried without thinking they could do it, not just in IT. And a sense of helplessness is [inherited].
 We need a filter that converts "X makes it impossible to do" into "It can be done, and even if it doesn't go smoothly, there is a way out, but X makes it impossible, so be careful about that.
 Helplessness is a contagious disease, and as an adult you can take steps to "keep your distance if you see an infected person," but it's very difficult when you're a child and your parents are infected.

  >Many parents (both explicitly and implicitly) want their children to "do well," and by that logic, they should stay away from anything that might go wrong. Parents who praise them for doing well usually do. It's very hard to get them to see otherwise. I wonder if it's partly because those parents are also imprinted on them from childhood.
   I suspect that the parents and I have different definitions of "doing well."
   Doing well" means trying many "things that can go wrong," succeeding in some of them, and of course making many mistakes, but they don't happen, and as a result, when outsiders look at you after the fact, you become "a person with some amazing achievements.

  [hidden hostility propagated].
   Parent A stops Child B from doing X, which Child B is trying to do.
   Child B feels anger, but endures. It becomes [hidden hostility].
   When grandson C tried to do X, child B said, "I was made to quit, why you! and gets angry and makes grandson C stop his behavior.
  I see [nishio.icon], it's the same composition as [the chain of abuse].
