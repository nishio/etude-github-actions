[Avoiding [Constraints
	From [Current Situation] to [Ideal Situation
		From the current state to the ideal state
		I want to move with simple implementation.
	left
		However, unexpected constraints may be discovered during implementation
		We work around it haphazardly.
		Actually, I should have turned left instead of right at the first end of the street.
		Lessons Learned Here
			Having willingly run into the constraints, I realized that the constraints existed.
			I should have looked into the shape of the constraints instead of haphazardly avoiding them.
	right
		Patterns that occur because of the well-known pattern on the left
		There is a vague "there may be constraints" concern up front.
		When you willingly run into constraints, you need to change your policy.
		Fear of it avoids a great deal of vague anxiety.
		But in fact, they didn't run into any restrictions if they went straight ahead.
		Lessons Learned Here
			Avoided a major detour due to anxiety/interpretation that "we might run into a constraint."
			This also neglects to examine the "shape of the constraint" as a fact.

　Fear of things I don't understand.
　　A version of avoidance by fear of [attack without looking closely
　　[The fact that there is a wall in the way is not a reason not to go forward.]
