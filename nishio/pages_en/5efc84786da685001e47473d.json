　I did np.zeros where I made a two-dimensional array filled with zeros, but in raw Python it's TLE, so I made a raw list and then PyPy'd it.
　chr is doing this to change the characters back to a string since they are integer values when buffer.read is done.
code:python
 def solve(S, T):
     sizeS = len(S)
     sizeT = len(T)
     m = [[0] * (sizeT + 1) for _i in range(sizeS + 1)]
     for i in range(1, sizeS + 1):
         for j in range(1, sizeT + 1):
             m[i][j] = max(
                 m[i - 1][j],
                 m[i][j - 1],
                 m[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 if S[i - 1] == T[j - 1] else 0
             )
     result = []
     i = sizeS
     j = sizeT
     while i > 0 and j > 0:
         if m[i][j] == m[i - 1][j]:
             i -= 1
         elif m[i][j] == m[i][j - 1]:
             j -= 1
         else:
             result.append(chr(S[i - 1]))
             i -= 1
             j -= 1
     print("".join(reversed(result)))
