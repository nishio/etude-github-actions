Tower of Sin Babel
Machine translation services will stop after machine translation becomes widespread and the know-how to learn foreign languages is lost #SF setting

>Future "No work today because Master AI has bent the whirlwind and is out of service."
ã€€(Context: [ChatGPT] failure)

>[https://twitter.com/tomoyaman/status/1628189953221087232?s=20 @tomoyaman]: @nishio I guess we will continue to need fortune tellers and prayer warriors as always.

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1628190327344623617?s=20 @nishio]: @tomoyaman Maybe the giant language model is the oracle-giving temple and the chat interface is the priestess
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1628191011301359617?s=20 @nishio]: @tomoyaman Ah, so there is a clergyman to please Master AI? Is that the question? Of course the clergy will be at the top of the [caste] (see below).

>[https://twitter.com/tomoyaman/status/1628192309291663360?s=20 @tomoyaman]: @nishio It's the age of the [Brahmin].
>Then, I suppose, some unreachable person will emerge from among humans and try to analyze God. Even though the suppression of the act continues, God will still continue to be analyzed, and when people begin to understand God in a cursory manner, it will be called science, and those who run science = scientists will arise, and scientists will use science to create AI....

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1628197751334006786?s=20 @nishio]: @tomoyaman I think that if we destroy machine translation, it will be like the fall of the Tower of Babel. If we destroy machine translation, it will be roughly the same as the collapse of the Tower of Babel.
