	Faster paths
	[Resolution of "Rendering process blocks path draw
		Paths are written on the overlay.
		Put into pathBuffer
		The number written is displayed.
		When I tap on the display, it drops down and a heavy redraw runs for the first time.

concern
 The pathBuffer should be flushed when switching tools, how should such code be written?
 　→ refactored and created code that is always called when the tool switches.
 Undo will not trigger unless you drop down the path, which is counter-intuitive.
 After dropping down the path, when I Undo, they are Undo'd one by one. Should they be done in batches?
