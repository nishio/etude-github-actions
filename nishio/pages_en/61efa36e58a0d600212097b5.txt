Two Lines of Why and How
There are two ways of thinking when the ideal is X but the reality is not X
　"[Why] not X?"
　How can we [do] X?"

Q: Isn't digging into the why a way to X?
A: Wrong. Digging deeper may result in something unchangeable.
　The condition that "why" leads to "how" is that it can be attributed to something that can be changed and retried.
