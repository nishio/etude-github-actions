 *1262833551*[cpp]Floating point number is 0 or not.
 For example, when doing 1 / x, if(x == 0.0) return ... I think it's because I added -Wfloat-equal, but I get a warning "warning: comparing floating point with == or ! = is unsafe" warning, I was wondering if I have to rewrite it in the form of abs(x) < EPSILON, how much should EPSILON be, etc.

 @nishio fpclassify(x) == FP_ZERO and so on.

 I decided to use this for now, so I made a note of it. I will think it over later.
 
 *1262835414* Continued: How many times does a perfect shuffle go back to normal?
 How many times does a <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090623/1245759753'>perfect shuffle undo</a> made six months ago?

 to be circular.

 I was able to do it.

 The diagram shows that after five shuffles of 30 cards "divided into halves and combined with each other", the cards return to their original sequence.

 If there are six cards "abcdef", first divide them in half, abc, def, and then combine them alternately to make "daebfc".
 
 Each shuffle, the first becomes the second, the second becomes the fourth, the fourth becomes the eighth, the eighth becomes the sixteenth, the sixteenth is the first of the second half when divided in half, so it comes back to the first on the next shuffle. five times.
 
 The third one becomes the sixth one, the sixth one becomes the twelfth one, the twelfth one becomes the twenty-fourth one, the twenty-fourth one becomes the seventeenth one because it is the ninth one in the second half, and the seventeenth one becomes the second one in the second half, so it comes back to the third one. It is still five times.
 
 The same is true for other cards, but I won't explain them.

 @atusi Too beautiful, is this 2D?
 @nishio 2D. implemented in C++, scribbled into a 2D array and output directly as PNG

 @taichino Are you talking about mapping 30 sheets and a period of 5 to some formula? Hmmm. But I don't know what the colors indicate.
 @nishio It's like this: you paint 30 cards with rainbow colors, and they start out lined up in rainbow colors (in the x-axis direction), then shuffle them once to make them alternate (1/5 counterclockwise around the circle), then repeat 5 times to get them back together.
 @taichino I see, so you are aware that the geometrical pattern was generated not with a formula, but with an event, which can be expressed naturally and beautifully?
 @nishio Yes, the formula is just using cos to make it a curve. This is what happened when I tried to describe the phenomenon of "shuffling back and forth."

 When writing a date, type up to 200 and then backspace one zero off.
