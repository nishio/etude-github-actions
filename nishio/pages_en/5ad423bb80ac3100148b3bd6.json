A book that should be chewed and digested well
Some books are enough to be tasted, some are enough to be swallowed whole without chewing, and only a very few need to be chewed and digested well.
ã€€[Very few books to chew on]

>Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.
 [Francis Bacon]
 Some [books] should be [tasted], some [swallowed], and some [books] should be [digested] with a good chewing
