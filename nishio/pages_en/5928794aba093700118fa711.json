I can't decide if my opinion about life is right or wrong.
There is no guarantee that what the sender writes is also good for the recipient, even if the sender intends it to be good for the recipient. An extreme example is when the sender is into religion. There is no right way to live, and everyone has only lived once, so they only know the world as they see it. It is impossible for those of us who live only once to judge which opinion is "generally correct. We can't even judge what the people around us are like.

You can't judge whether an opinion about life is right or wrong. But "how" is another thing. If his opinion is accompanied by a description of "how to improve your life," you can test it yourself to see if it is correct. If not, you can only accept his opinion without evidence or ignore it without evidence.

And the sender should not assume that he/she is able to transmit a "good way of life. They can only talk about "the methods they believe to be a good way of life" and "the results of those methods. And the verification of that method must be left to the reader.
