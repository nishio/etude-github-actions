(5.2.4.5) Benefits of reducing burden by classification
If there are hundreds of pieces of information, there is a merit of reducing the burden of classifying and focusing on only a part. For example, in [(2.1.4.2) Make a base],I introduced a method to classify tasks to be done today or not, and focus only on things to do today. This technique reduces the burden of cognition by classification when there are too many tasks.

When I wrote the manuscript of this book, there were about 700 pieces of paper. With this number of pieces, even if I spread them, I can not see them in a glance. (*24)

I'm familiar with the KJ method, but handling hundreds of pieces is hard. So I divided them by chapter and focused on pieces for only one chapter at once.

However, this chapter was not determined by top-down. First of all, I wrote out pieces and grouped them up in a bottom-up manner. This work emerges a chapter structure. A detailed story on how I did it comes in "Making a nameplate when it is huge" (â˜… page). #TODO link

Footnote: (*24) If you place the pieces on A4 paper, there are around 25 pieces of paper per sheet. So with 700 pieces of paper go 28 sheets of A4 paper.
