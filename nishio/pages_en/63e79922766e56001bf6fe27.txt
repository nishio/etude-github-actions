What did you do last week?
 To prepare for the [Programming Change Study Group].
 　I'm also testing a new feature of Kozaneba that I created the other week.
 　[Kozaneba: Changes in programming languages in the last decade].
 　I've updated it to reflect that.

 I realized I hadn't switched digital notebooks at the beginning of the year.
 　My current notebook was used on 2022-01-03 and the one before that on 2021-01-02.
 　My current notebook has 668 pages.
 　I'm saving in PDF format to Dropbox with automatic backup, but I'm wondering if there are any problems if the file size keeps increasing.
 　　It was 168 MB.
 　　You have to wait a while for it to open on Dropbox, and that's not good.
　I used to think, "My handwriting is so bad, it's probably no good anyway," but over the years I've gotten much more accurate.
