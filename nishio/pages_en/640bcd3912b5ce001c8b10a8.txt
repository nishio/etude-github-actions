> A note on how to use awareness when capturing information. At first, you see a clear, definite outline. By becoming hazy, you start to see something like a cloud, abstractly. If you keep that state, like a mirage, you will see the [shadow] of the essence.

> When creating, increasing the resolution of observation does not necessarily mean making the outline of what you see even clearer, but I think there is a filter that loosens the focus a little and generates something like a fog or a cloud.
>
> Too busy and the mirage will not occur. Too often it is too correct and not deep enough. I'm not sure if this is a technique, a hunch, or an error, but a note that I have that feeling.
