Blogs and Books
When blogging
	Write what you feel like writing.
 Write about how you stumbled, then solved the problem, and then say, "With this article, I wouldn't have stumbled in the past.
There are two patterns, and the same pattern applies when writing books, but if you write in the latter pattern, readers will say, "I wish this book had been available to me years ago!" and recommend it to their juniors.

Before the Internet, a place to "write what you feel like writing" was the exclusive domain of a limited number of people who wrote books and newspapers, but since the Internet, many people have been able to publish their thoughts in writing due to the decline in information distribution costs.
As supply increases, competition becomes more intense. Those who were in a monopolistic position as information providers when there was no competition tend to interpret the spread of the Internet as "we are now getting opposition from the Internet, and the Internet is not good for us". In reality, however, it is the same as when a monopolistic company in the past tended to interpret the situation in which its monopolistic position collapsed and it became involved in competition as "a new entrant with low quality appeared. The competitive environment has changed.
It is the customer who makes the choice. Not the creator.

A similar competitive relationship is emerging between books and blogs, so books, which have a disadvantage in the speed of information dissemination, must focus on features that blogs do not have. Providing solutions to problems at a higher level of abstraction.
	After writing all this, I thought, "No, why don't we use Burogu to provide more abstract solutions to these problems?" I thought to myself.
 What exactly are books written for?
