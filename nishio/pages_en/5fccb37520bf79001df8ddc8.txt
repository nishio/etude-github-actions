D The problem is to read the displayed values from the LED lighting information. It is guaranteed that nothing other than the pattern to be recognized will come in, so I made a list of patterns to be recognized and compared them with perfect matches. Of course, this list of patterns is used in the program, a quick transformation in Python's interactive console.
code:python
 N = int(input())
 S = [input(), input(), input(), input(), input()]
 
 PATTERNS = """
 ####.##.##.####
 .#.##..#..#.###
 ###..#####..###
 ###..####..####
 #.##.####..#..#
 ####..###..####
 ####..####.####
 ###..#..#..#..#
 ####.#####.####
 ####.####..####
 """.strip().split()
 
 result = ""
 for i in range(N):
     char = "".join(S[j][i * 4 + 1:i * 4 + 4] for j in range(5))
     result += str(PATTERNS.index(char))
 print(result)
