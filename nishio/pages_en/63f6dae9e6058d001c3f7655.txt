Do not attempt to give to those who are unwilling to receive

>Do not give holy things to dogs. And do not cast pearls before swine. The dogs and pigs will trample them under their feet, turn around and chew you to pieces!
	from New Testament, [Gospel of Matthew] 7:6, New Revised Bible Center (Translation), The Bible, New Revised Translation 2017.

>I'm trying to teach a starving person how to fish, not give him a fish... The problem is that starving people don't understand the value of learning to fish and ask you to give them fish, or they resent you for not giving them fish.
> "Your axe is very rusty, shouldn't you sharpen it?" > "I'm so busy chopping wood I don't have time to sharpen my axe!" Like that.
	from [ask someone and search].

>We don't move on our own unless you tell us... They won't move on their own unless they say... If you don't see how [serious] they are, you know you're going to hurt them.
	from [top tier won't tell you unless you ask them to tell you].

There were stories of people who reached out to poor households out of the goodness of their hearts, and instead of gratitude being returned, hatred and violence was returned.
　But there's a slightly different cut-and-dry interpretation of this.
　　[Gratitude trumps money.]
