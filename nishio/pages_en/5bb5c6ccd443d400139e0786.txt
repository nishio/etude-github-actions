Originality v.s. Top market share
There is person A who thinks it is good to be [original] and person B who thinks it is good to be [market share leader
A does not imitate the actions of X that were done before him. Because imitation does not make one an original.
B will imitate if they think they can catch up and overtake by imitation.
What is important to him is to get to the [market share] top, and the order in which he starts is irrelevant.
