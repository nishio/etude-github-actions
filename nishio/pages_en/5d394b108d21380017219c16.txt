Trade-off between interoperability and uniqueness
[Interconnectivity] increases the potential for value creation through combination.
Uniqueness increases the likelihood of demonstrating unique value.
	Interconnectivity is often an overhead in achieving uniqueness

The two are [trade-offs].
	So "which is better" is a low-resolution argument
	We have to recognize the situation with a higher resolution and find the right [good] point.
