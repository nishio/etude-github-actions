parking lot
>A space in a desk or a corner of a whiteboard is used in a discussion to temporarily hold off on topics that are not considered to be discussed at the moment. It is said to have the effect of avoiding confusion and unnecessary discussion. It is used to [isolate] topics that are off-topic, but it is said that the topics reserved in the parking lot may become useful as the discussion progresses.

Using Jiro Kawakita's vocabulary, it's a place to put [a monkey away from the monkey].
　Discussions in this era were [voice communication] where only one thing could be said at a time, so it was easy to miss the "[possibly related] things" that came up by association from the topic.
　Record it and keep it close by so you can use it later.
