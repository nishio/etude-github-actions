Slide making after KJ method
 There are many things I want to include in the [presentation material
 The way it's been done so far
 	write out on a sticky note
  [Use the KJ method to place stickies in such a way that as many as possible are connected to other stickies.
  Create a document with most of the sticky notes pieced together in a mousy, organic way.
 This is a lot of work.
  They say it doesn't translate into much customer value for all the hard work.
  for some reason
   It seems that the way to connect what is "connected" to me, is not apparent to the average person unless there are three extra slides.
    Thoughts on [IT and Management].
   The result is a vast sea of information that seems to be connected, but we cannot be sure that it is.
 They say it's more satisfying to define the start and the goal first and then connect them in a precise manner.

 How to do it after visualizing the network by lining it up using the KJ method.
  The way it's been done so far: "find a path through the whole thing."
   The KJ legal way of doing things is the right way.
   New ideas are generated by trying to include the information somehow without throwing it away.
  A new way of doing things: "Set a start and a goal, and connect them smoothly."
 Let's aim for a new way of doing things.
  If you do that, though, the ones that appear in the stickies will be cut off with a bang.
 I want to encourage action, not just listen and "hear a good story" and be done with it.
  So the goal is inevitably determined.
  The majority of the audience ends up presenting Next Actions that are feasible and mostly beneficial to the majority of the audience.
  We can logically connect to it.
