collation
>8. I was troubled by the lack of a suitable word for "refer" or "reference" in Japanese, but I decided to translate it as "collate" or "collate". I was troubled by the lack of words that fit the Japanese word "refer" or "reference," but I decided to translate them as "collate" or "collate. I thought about using "refer" or "referrance" as they are in the original language, but I decided to go with "collation" because I thought it was a rather good translation and would be easy for Japanese to understand. Therefore, I decided to translate "direct reference," which was made into an academic term by Gendlin, as "direct collation. I would like to thank Mr. Yo Ikemi for his valuable suggestions on this point. (However, although Mr. Kumagai has taught us that philosophers translate the term as "instruction" or "directs," we have decided not to use the word "directs" in this translation.)
