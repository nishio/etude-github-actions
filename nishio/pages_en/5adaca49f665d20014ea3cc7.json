The Dictator's Strongest Speech Technique
The book compares Hitler's speech and Hashimoto's speech and explains how they fit into the golden rule of storytelling proposed by the author.
I'm going to get sued by Toru Hashimoto.
Roosevelt and Kakuei Tanaka will be there.

Aside from that, the content is very observant.

The author had previously written a book titled "Why That Speech Moved People" and wanted to feature Hitler, but it was dropped due to an editorial decision. That is how this book was born.
