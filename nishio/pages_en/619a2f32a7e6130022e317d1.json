ELIZA
>ELIZA is one of the early naive natural language processing programs. It is interactive, but it is not a spoken conversation system. It works by processing the user's responses to scripts, the best known of which is DOCTOR, a simulation of a therapist in client-centered therapy. Although it had little or no information about human thoughts and feelings, DOCTOR could engage in surprisingly human-like dialogue; Joseph Weisenbaum of MIT wrote ELIZA between 1964 and 1966. It is the software that gave rise to the so-called [artificial anencephaly].
