	The Goal = corporate goal = to make money.
	There are too many different indicators, especially in the management of a factory.
 	As a result, we make the mistake of focusing on something that is not a measure of the achievement of this "making money"
  Especially bad for "occupancy rates".
		Example of [incorrect KPI setting
 Financial Indicators
 	[Net income: Amount of profit made
  [Return on investment: The amount of profit made in relation to the amount invested.
  [Cash flow: money in and money out
 Values commonly used in factories, such as the number of units produced per hour, are not directly related to this financial indicator.
 Goldratt's proposed indicators
 	[Throughput: Percentage of money generated through sales.
  [Inventory: All money invested to buy what you intend to sell.
  [Business expense: money spent to convert inventory into throughput.
 Reducing production capacity by 100% to match market demand reduces throughput and increases inventories
 	Occurs when there is a [dependent event] that is subject to [statistical variation
  You can slow down to suit the situation, but you can't go faster.
  As a result, statistical variation is not averaged and lags accumulate
 Throughput is defined by [bottleneck
 	The bottleneck is "[constraint]"
 	Improve efficiency of bottlenecks
  	Devise a break time so that the machine does not stop.
			Don't create something you won't need right away.
   Do quality inspections before bottlenecks.
  Reduce bottleneck load
  	If we can work on it in other ways, we'll channel it there.
		Increasing non-bottleneck utilization creates inventory at the expense of operations.
   Non-bottlenecks can afford to make more than the bottleneck can handle
   Throughput does not increase because it is determined by bottlenecks
   As a result, work-in-process inventory builds up.
 [drum buffer rope]
		Pace of bottlenecks determines overall material input timing (drums)
  	Materials needed in the process after the bottleneck should reach the bottleneck by the time the materials pass through the bottleneck to get there
  Reduce work-in-process inventory before bottlenecks by not feeding front-end processes at a rate faster than the bottleneck can handle (rope)
		Accidents and other unforeseen statistical fluctuations are not a problem because there is power outside the bottleneck, but they are a problem when the bottleneck is affected, and there is a buffer to prevent the bottleneck from stopping.
	The weakest ring determines the strength of the entire chain.
