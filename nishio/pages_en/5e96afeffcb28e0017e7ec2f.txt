Discord is all about flow.
　[Discord] is allocated to [flow
　In the early days, there was no [permalink] for statements.
　　Contrast with Slack and others that put permalinks on each post.
　Because it comes from real-time game chat?
　Maybe the culture is to write in [Wiki] what should be saved in the first place?
　　The thought that chat logs that may be mentioned in the future should be reprinted
　　Clear switching between flow and stock
