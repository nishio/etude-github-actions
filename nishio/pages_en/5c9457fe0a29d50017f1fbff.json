Auto Bracketing
2019-03-21
Automatic bracketing is not good because if a large number of low-quality links are generated, only garbage will be suggested, resulting in "trashing" the site. However, it is the "low quality" that is the problem, not the automatic nature of the links. What is [link quality]?

Consider a bad example
	For example, let's say each page of a book is a Scrapbox page.
		If a certain keyword X appears 100 times, it's not appropriate to make it a link all the time.

			If you see a hundred links, it's just "Wow, that's a lot of links.
			Then it would still be better to present only the information, "You will find that keyword in book A.
			This is [a case of finding unexpectedly in a search].
				A keyword is unexpectedly presented as being included in a certain book and feels valuable
				You can open the book and search again to see which specific page in the book it is on.
			There is no straightforward way to achieve this on Scrapbox.
				For example, if each page has a "book ID (name or ISBN)", you can use the ID and a set of keywords to narrow down the search within a book.
				If we try to achieve this with a link, we would need a link that expresses "the occurrence of keyword X in book A".

Narrow links are useful
	In other words, "links that appear infrequently in other text" are useful
		On the other hand, my most linked in Scrapbox is the `KJ method` and the `Engineer's Intellectual Production Method`.
			Words related to the content of interest are naturally frequent.
			The dilemma of choosing something that simply appears infrequently is to choose something that is "uninteresting".

	Similar concept to [IDF
		If all links are equivalent, then it is a function of IDF
			In fact, the links are not equivalent.
				The same "five times" but these are different in usefulness.

	Links between distant objects are beneficial.
		So there is "near" and "far" as a relationship between pages
			How is this defined?
			[page close].

	What is [page proximity]?
		Pages belonging to the same chapter are close pages
			This should give the chapter structure as metadata
		Pages belonging to the same author's book are close pages
		Book > Chapter > Section ... Hierarchical Structure
		When the lower structure contains keywords, the upper structure also contains keywords.
			This has a [pooling] feel to it.
			Hierarchical structure is a good fit for Given
				A keyword that appears five times in the same book is different from a keyword that appears five times in the same chapter or five times across chapters.
				[pooling], the former will be one time, the latter five times.
				Higher IDFs in higher tiers are more valuable.
		What if the hierarchical structure is not Given?
 		Assuming a book, adjacent pages are close pages
 		Pages with similar content (= many keywords in common) are close pages
 		The hierarchical structure could be created by [agglomerative hierarchical clustering].

	Can't we [determine proximity by search]?
		[nodal point of thought 2019-02-18#5c6a9ccfaff09e00004ee473] as it relates to
	Bonus if the link already exists in Scrapbox
	I want it to be able to run incrementally.
	I hope it can be improved incrementally.
