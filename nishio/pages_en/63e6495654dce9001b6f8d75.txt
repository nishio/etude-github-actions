CNN is able to learn without classification.
	I think the reason humans have the habit of naming and [categorizing] sets of things is because humans are poor computational calculators that don't have the ability to remember, for example, a 768-dimensional vector and calculate the inner product with other vectors[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
ã€€ Therefore, we try to compress the information by [clustering] only the information of representative points, so that even a computer with poor computing power can manage to do so.
