 - You have two children. If the question is asked, "Is one of the two children a boy?" and the answer is "yes," the probability that the non-boy child is a boy is 1/3
 - If the question is asked, "Is one of the two born on Monday a boy?" and the answer is "yes," the probability that the non-boy child is a boy is 13/27.
 - Why did the probability increase? Is there information in the "born on Monday" part?
 - Even if the answer to the question "Are either of the two of you Hanshin fans?" without gender-specific information is "yes," the probability that the child of the one who is not a Hanshin fan is a boy remains 1/2.
 - The mixing of "born on Monday," which is useless information in identifying gender, made it impossible to obtain information in the case of a boy born on Tuesday or Wednesday, where information could have been obtained if the question had simply been "Is it a boy? As a result, the probability after hearing the answer approached 1/2, the original probability.
 - Simply put, "the probability did not increase because of more information; the probability did not change much because of less information."
