　Thoughts.
　　N times is enough
　　Never move the same thing twice.
　　　If you only do it the second time, the result is the same.
　　　[Doing it twice doesn't make sense.]
　　So, for a given one, the problem is divided into "move it to the beginning", "move it to the end", and "don't move it".
　　The ones that were not moved need to be in ascending order.
　　Find the smallest sum of a and b such that the remainder is in ascending order when a from the smallest number is eliminated and b from the largest number is eliminated.
　　Order of squares in a naive search.
　　Conversely, find the longest "such columns that are in ascending order
　　Create "number -> position" in linear order.
　　Count while the number is increasing, reset when it decreases, and find the location with the largest count.
　　　This is a linear order
　Official Explanation
　　OK

[Issue split]
　[Sort by number sequence in ascending order]
　[Minimize number of operations]
