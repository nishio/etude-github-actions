 *1215376960*[cpp]Try using alias & boost::assign does O(N^2) copies to add N?
 Suppose there is a vector of some object that is heavily copied (named matrix). When processing the i-th vector, it would be tedious and hard to read to write "matrix[i]" every time. We want to use an alias like "line" here.
 
 
 In Python, variables are fundamentally references, so line = matrix[i] is fine, but doing this in C++ is heavy because it copies the contents of matrix[i]. I had struggled to avoid using pointers in <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20080626/1214499822'>Single Round Match 407 - Yasukazu Nishio's Hatena Diary</a> before, and ended up using pointers. I ended up using pointers.
 
 
 But when I was reading the C++ primer, it says there is such a thing as a "reference type"!
 >|cpp|
 int main(){
   vector<MyValue> maxtix;
   matrix += MyValue(1), MyValue(2), MyValue(3);
   MyValue &line = matrix[1]; 
   cout << line.value << endl;
 }
 ||<
 Oooh, that's what I was looking for! Let's see if "&line = matrix[i]" doesn't cause copying.
 
 >|cpp|
 int main(){
   vector<MyValue> matrix;
   matrix += MyValue(1), MyValue(2), MyValue(3);
   cout << "start assgin" << endl;
   MyValue &line = matrix[1];
   cout << "end assgin" << endl;
   cout << line.value << endl;
 }

 Wait a minute. The assignment to the reference type is indeed not copying, but boost::assign is copying a lot ><

 A mystery my sleepy head can't figure out.

 It was so hot yesterday that I turned on the air conditioning, but I thought I should change into proper pajamas with sleeves when I sleep with the air conditioning on. My tonsils are popping.
 
 -----
 
 My head is pounding. When it's hot, remember to turn on the air conditioning. When you turn on the air conditioner, remember to cover yourself with a futon. Remember to stay hydrated. Eating properly.
 
 Thinking about it calmly, I can't remember what I ate after the eel bowl I had at Sukiya on Saturday morning, and I am pretty sure that I didn't eat it. Also, I haven't ordered any supplements yet. I'm still in a daze.
