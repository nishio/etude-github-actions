The average of a vector is not an Idea.
>[fladdict https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1638562418564673537/photo/1] I have a hypothesis for a "mathematical operation of universal good or idea" using AI, but I would like to know if anyone familiar with machine learning or natural language I would like to know if my understanding is correct.
> First, with GPT or something, make a million or so samples of "good" and "bad" acts (continued).

>[fladdict https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1638562885180993536] If you do it side by side. if ML is well learned, "good" and "bad" should be distributed in a linearly separable way, in a hyperplane space of thousands of dimensions. Like the distribution of male and female faces on StyleGAN.

>[fladdict https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1638563199539871744] and at this point, we just create a vector that leads to "random good/evil pairs". (500,000 pairs for 1 million data)...

>[fladdict https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1638564619387273216] If we can compute a vector of "goodness" that penetrates the hyperdimension, we can ask ourselves, "How good is concept A or concept B? or, if we pull bad act C in the direction of good, what kind of act would it be? I think it would be possible to calculate....

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638562418564673537/photo/1] There's no guarantee that 2 is linearly separable, and if it were linearly separable, it would just be a normal vector without the hassle of 3, You're just describing an idea as a component of a concept you don't understand, and as a result, you can't judge whether the idea is good or bad.

> First, assume that there is an Idea of a certain concept (at least an Idea in Western philosophy) like this. (continued).

>[fladdict https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1638575745311313920] At this point, almost all philosophical thought can be interpreted as "the shooting that each philosopher did his best to do in his own way to shoot through the center of the target, the Idea.

>[fladdict https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1638576290562478081] At this point, the differences in each philosophical thought should be able to be treated as "a matter of accuracy in collecting bullets when various people shoot at targets with various guns".

>[fladdict https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1638576939710689280] In this case, if the number of philosophers and the variety of ideas are sufficiently large and diverse, the edges of each claim (the sum of noise and bias) will mutually If the number and variety of philosophers is sufficiently large, the edges of their arguments (the sum of noise and bias) will cancel each other out...

>[fladdict https://twitter.com/fladdict/status/1638577632060260353] If you can synthesize the vectors of all philosophical ideas and find the average vector, it should approximate with high probability to coordinates close to the center of the Idea. (It should be as reliable as adding people's faces makes them beautiful, or index averages are more stable than active investments).

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638582434865496064] It's not an arithmetic operation to extract the average of vectors or ideas, so if there are too many Westerners, "God is good," and if you put in outliers like Hitler, you get a big pull. And if you select who to include and who not to include, the result will only reflect that because "the person who selected has made a judgment of right and wrong".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638584604788678656] Oh, yeah, and on a simpler note, most of the ideas left in writing over a fairly long period of time have been written by men, so if you take the average vector, of course If you take the average vector, the output would naturally be "men are better than women". You shouldn't say that the average vector is an idea of goodness, because it is just that.
