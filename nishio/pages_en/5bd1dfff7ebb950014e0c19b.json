[OCR Garbled Detection Elimination Model
	1: Model to detect OCR corruption
 	There is a clear difference in the probability distribution of character occurrence between the OCR garbled area and the non-OCR garbled area.
  Could be identified by a character-based CNN or Transformer.
 2: Model to repair OCR corruption
 	The affiliate lengths are different, and it must be difficult to...
  Put the garbled part and its surrounding context into a Transformer or other device that can take variable-length input as a set.
  The decoder then spits out an indefinite-length output.
  It seems that a human being would have to carefully create training data to learn...
  Inverse functions are learned by feeding text with known correct answers to OCR
