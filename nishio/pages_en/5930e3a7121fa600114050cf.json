Parable of the Bicycle Auxiliary Wheels
X is a bicycle auxiliary wheel. It has the advantage of getting people used to bicycles. But only at first. No adult rides a bicycle with an auxiliary wheel.

Just because adults do not ride with auxiliary wheels does not mean that it is wrong for children, who are still in the process of learning how to ride a bicycle, to use them.
It is ridiculous to say things like, "I would rather not be able to ride a bicycle than use something as unnatural as an auxiliary wheel."
