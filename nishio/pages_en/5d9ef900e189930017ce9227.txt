2 times.
First, f(1) = a is obtained. This is the sum of all coefficients.
The fact that the coefficients are non-negative indicates that each coefficient does not exceed a.
Then f(n) is obtained for any integer n greater than a.
Since each coefficient is non-negative and an integer of at most a, f(n) corresponds to placing each coefficient at each digit of the n-decimal notation.
So we can find all the coefficients by dividing by n and repeating the process of taking the remainder.
