The Parable of the Too Many Seedlings
Even if a lot [sprouts], the amount that can be planted in the field is limited.

Why is a reasonable spacing necessary? Will it lose light? Will it reduce ventilation and become infested with disease?

What I thought was different
　Field with [weeds
　　Weeds are unnecessary and there is no hesitation in pulling them out.
　　All of them are "seedlings that would be reasonably fruitful if planted and grown in a field," which is the essence of this problem.
