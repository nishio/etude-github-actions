All should learn X.
When the proposition that "it is beneficial to learn X" is True, some people jump to the conclusion that it is also True that "all people should learn X." This forgets about [division of labor] and [comparative advantage]. Even if not everyone learns X, if those who did not learn it pay more and those who did learn it receive it, society as a whole can be more efficient than if everyone learned X.
