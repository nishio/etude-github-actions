 **1407141333*Kyoto University Summer Design School 2014 Participants wanted (first-come, first-served)
 <a href='http://www.design.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sds2014/'>Kyoto University Summer Design School 2014</a> is a design workshop that will take place over three days from September 24-26.
 
 From Cybozu, myself and Takezako will conduct a workshop called <a href='http://www.design.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sds2014/ja/theme01.html'>"Designing the Way You Learn - Finding Blind Spots"</a>. The purpose of this workshop is for each participant to reflect on his or her own learning style, find problems and blind spots, and devise a plan for improvement, in other words, "design your learning style.
 
 In addition to the Cybozu workshops, there will be workshops on a variety of other topics. We would appreciate it if you could tell people you know who might be interested in this event. Working people are also welcome.
 
 The lecture material</a> for the workshop <a href='http://nhiro.org/kuds2013/'>"Designing Teamwork" we conducted last year is now available. This year's workshop will be largely the same as this one, based on the KJ method.
 
 Please note that starting this year, theme selection will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Themes that reach capacity will be closed, so there is a possibility that you may not be able to apply for the theme of your choice. Please be careful.
