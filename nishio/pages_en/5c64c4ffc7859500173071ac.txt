	The [writing out method] is to write down thoughts as small fragments.
		What you write down will not disappear.
		You can think further as you look at what you have written down.
	[Bottom-up] [grouping] of [KJ Method] expresses [relationship] of information by [physical proximity].
		Output sensations that are difficult to put into words in a non-verbal way
		The output will not disappear and can be the subject of thought.
		This assists in the discovery of structure
	[Scrapbox] represents [association] with [link
		Link to written or copied and pasted text after the fact.
		Bullet points are recommended when writing, a concept similar to the "in small pieces" writing method.
			Write short sentences instead of trying to write long sentences from the beginning.
		Turn phrases that "sound important" in your written or copied and pasted text into links.
			Whether or not the linked page exists at this time is irrelevant.
			Even if you can't verbalize why you think it's important, you can still make the link.
		Link to associated pages, etc.
			Even if you can't verbalize why you think it's relevant, you can still link it.
		The output link will not disappear and can be the subject of thought.
		The presence or absence of a linked page is indicated by color.
			= You can follow one link and realize that there is something there.
		2-hop link
			= You can follow two links and notice what's there.
		These features support associations
	[Search] strengthens the "ability to find" for the "verbalized" in this figure.
		Currently my KJ method is done on paper and is not searchable. I would like to digitize it.

		I was going to write "Digitizing and searching", "Writing out method/KJ method", and "Scrapbox" as the "Three sacred tools of intellectual production", but I wrote that "Digitizing and searching" "strengthens the ability to find information and pull out detailed information from fragmented information" and "Writing out method/KJ method" "strengthens the ability to find patterns by writing information down in small units and then assembling it from the bottom up". I couldn't figure out what Scrapbox was supposed to enhance.
		>Kouta Uchida, the connection between the pieces of information?
		>I think scrapbox is like a long term KJ method.
		What kind of intellectual capacities are enhanced by the existence of "[information fragment connections]?
		I thought that search enhances "the ability to recall details after keywords can be verbalized", while Scrapbox enhances "the ability to recall hooks before keywords can be verbalized", but keywords are explicitly linked, so I guess not!
		>Daiki Teramoto: Since Scrapbox is a tool that is also useful when you want to "write out and KJ method" and can "digitize and search", I thought that the third one should also be a purpose or method, not a tool. Languaging, diagramming, and so on.
		Sure > Scrapbox is also useful when you want to do "how to write and KJ method" and a tool that allows you to "digitize and search".
		>>Taiki Teramoto: As for what Scrapbox strengthens, when I observe Nishio-san from the outside, I see him writing down "Scrapbox this later," which seems to me to be a way of "strengthening the motivation to record small bits of awareness in a public scrapbox". I think so.
			I had been writing about this on my blog, Twitter, and Facebook before Scrapbox. When I see something scattered in the [This Day in the Past] function, I put it in Scrapbox and add a link to it, and I see the benefit of "the scattered things reconnecting and becoming a network".
	>Kuikei Jun In Stock
		Not even close.
	 If you just want to stock something, you can do it with a blog, Evernote, or a text file at hand, but for some reason I feel that Scrapbox has a value that goes beyond them.
	 The wiki-like feature seems to have some impact, but I'm still trying to verbalize what the heck that "ability to link between pages" is enhancing.
	 >I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I'm not sure........
	 Oh, right, you can stock subjective "associations".
	 Stocking associations increases the scope of associative search with the aid of 2-hop links.

[IT technology can be applied to the output].
