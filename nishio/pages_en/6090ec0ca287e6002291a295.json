 *1360416801*Made a box of light.
 I made Taizo Matsumura's <a href='http://plaza.harmonix.ne.jp/~taizo/n_hp/work_page/kit.html'>"Box of Light" kit</a>. It is interesting to see how the pattern and the sharpness of the light lines change depending on the direction of the light. It is a pity that the photo does not show it as I see it.

 I took a video of it, but my wife gets mad at me for not fixing the camera, and I think to myself, "Why did I put the camera in portrait mode?

 The circle's edges look blurred where there is a gap between the tracing paper and the mirror film tube on the front side due to insufficient workmanship. The blackened areas are where the mirror film is pressed against the tracing paper and the edges are turned up, creating shadows. I was in a great hurry to make it because it came out in the cleanup before the move and was almost thrown away before I could make it, but I thought it would be nice to take the time to make it again. If I ever have a relative's child to take care of, I might buy two sets and make them together.
