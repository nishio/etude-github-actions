Will/can/must and project adoption
from [node of thought 2021-05-06].

I thought there was a relationship between will/can/must and project adoption. Also, I thought these three were low resolution and should be separated more.
　I recently talked about [Will/Can/Must and Agile] on Twitter.
　In relation to this, I have reorganized the [Will/Can/Must] statements that were written in the past.
　　I also noted that it's not a monolithic concept and there are swings in usage.

　　What hypotheses will be tested in the prototype?

　　Feelings on the part of the mentor
　　　[strong/interesting/important/want to cooperate]
　　were written independently of each other.
　Aren't these three interrelated?

　summary
 　Project proposals are [Will/Can/Must]. It is important that this Must be voluntarily set.
 　The project with the largest "Want to adopt" (Will) in Nishio will be adopted. The strength of the Will is determined by the compatibility between the proposal's Will/Can/Must and Nishio's Will/Can/Must.
