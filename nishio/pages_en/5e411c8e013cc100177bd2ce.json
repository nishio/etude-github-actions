Indication when there is no nameplate in the closed group
Indication when there is no nameplate in the closed group
	What should happen when a group "folds" without a nameplate?
	Proposal to use the top leftmost sticky as a nameplate
 	If you can change the placement within a group, it is KJ-legal natural to use the top left corner as the nameplate.
	Proposal to make it a thumbnail
		Thumbnail -> unreadable
		Thumbnail, I was thinking of an image rendering, but maybe it could simply be a scaled-down version of the image.
	What about when folding illustrated items?
		If you fold a set of paths, without sticky notes, it is a natural thumbnail
	Can there be more than one way to digest?
		If you can switch after the fact.
		The rules for which way to default need not be clear now.
		If you try it and it doesn't feel right, just fix it.
	Thumbnail for paths only, top left for stickies only
