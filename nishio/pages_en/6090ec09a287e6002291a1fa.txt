 *1329881717*Story about being told to use w3m instead of telnet.
 I was trying to check the response header using telnet, which I am not accustomed to, when I said, "Oh, no, it's not there." I was not familiar with telnet and tried to check the response headers.

 $ telnet localhost 8101
 Trying 127.0.0.1...
 Connected to localhost.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 GET /static/t
 
 <html>
 <h1>hello</h1>
 Connection closed by foreign host.
 ||<
 
 The correct answer was.
 
 >||
 $ telnet localhost 8101
 Trying 127.0.0.1...
 Connected to localhost.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 GET /static/t HTTP/1.0
 
 HTTP/1.0 200 OK

 However, I was told "telnet is so tedious, why don't you just use w3m", so I made a note of it.
