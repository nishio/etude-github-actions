All I can do is study.
>I have never seen such a person in my life, but I wonder if he/she really exists, and I have a feeling that it is a delusion thought up by people who cannot study.

I feel that there are people who "cannot learn new things without [textbooks]," and if you pair such a person with B "who cannot give proper education to such a person," B will say, "A can [study] but cannot learn the job, he is a person who can only study," but essentially both parties are at fault [mistake communication], which is essentially the fault of both parties.

This miscommunication is especially likely to occur when B is the type of person who learns from actual experience rather than from textbooks.
