Make the problem small.
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems

　Can be recurrently split if the split problem has the same structure
　　Crush it down to a small enough obvious problem.
　　quick sort
　Split problems are in different forms, but each can be solved independently.
　　square partitioning
　There's a dependency on the split issue, but it's a DAG.
　　The minimal source when the DAG is viewed as a semi-ordered relation can be solved without dependence
　　dynamic programming
　　mathematical induction
