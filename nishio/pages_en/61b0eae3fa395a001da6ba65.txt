To express is to be aware
>"For the subject who speaks, to express is to be aware. He does not express himself merely for the sake of others. He expresses in order to know for himself what he is aiming at" ([Merleau-Ponty], Takahashi (trans.), [Issues in Phenomenology]).

I'm writing this not for others, but for myself to know [you may read it].
　That's [half, but not all] of the reason why I write things in this Scrapbox.
　Sometimes I write a summary article with the feeling that "since I have received charity from the world, I should also give charity to the world."
