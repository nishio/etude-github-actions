Re: verbalization
from [/villagepump/language].
	If you describe something that is hard to put into words in one language, wouldn't you only have [one way to look at it]? [/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon].
	Make a "[tentative verbalization]" A of something X that is hazy, and then recheck whether that verbalization "[feels] right"[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
	 If it fits, I can point to it in words, since no difference between X and A has been found at this point.
	 If it doesn't feel right, we can ask, "What's the difference?" we can separate "the part of X that is included in A" and "the part of X that is not included in A" by asking, "What is the difference? This is a change in the direction of increasing [cognitive resolution
	 We don't know in advance which way it will go, but [it will be beneficial either way].
	 Does it feel right?" question must be repeated from time to time, or you will stay with the first answer.
	 　I think this is what they mean by "if you put it in one language, you can only see it in one way."
	 　This is not a problem of having verbalized, but of not [asking] the question

Fits well: [direct matching].
Question again: [double-loop study].
