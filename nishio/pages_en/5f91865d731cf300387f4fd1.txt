	Thoughts.
	　The floor can be interpreted as expanding into a one-dimensional array and painting an area of length N+1
			Pattern of no sentries for [Add sentries when loading map].
	　I wonder if the minimum number of times is good because they are applied in order from the end, sounds good, but I want to prove it.
	　If a section is painted starting from the smallest square that has not yet been painted, there are equal or fewer squares remaining than if the section is painted from further to the left.
	　If you paint more from the right, you will have leftover paint, so you have to paint again from the left to paint it.
	　OK
	　To recap.
	　　When painting a minimum number of moves, there exists one move that is painted from the left-most square. It is shown that there exists a minimum number of moves painting such that this is the one starting from the left-most not yet painted square.
	　　When the starting point is more to the left, the "unpainted squares" after that paint is done are non-decreasing, so there is no possibility of a less labor intensive paint job
	　　When the starting point is more to the right, the square of interest is left unpainted, so it is necessary to paint over it separately. This is inconsistent with being a "move that paints from more left".
	　　Therefore, it is shown that the first move is made by painting starting from the leftmost square that has not been painted.
	Official Explanation
	　OK
