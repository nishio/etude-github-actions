 **1266699738*[Dominion] Throne + Lab.

 I started with a compressed deck of witches + chapels, then bought more villages, thrones, labs, and so on until I had 1 witch, 1 chapel, 1 village, 3 thrones, 2 labs, 2 gold coins, 2 silver coins, and then started pulling 8 coins. Personally, I feel like I have to compress and remove the curse cleanly in a set with witches and chapels.
 
 I thought the compression strategy would be weak against curses, but I felt it was rather strong because curses are removed quickly.
 
 It's a delicate problem to generalize, but since there are only 30 curse cards, if the witch is not guarded by a moat, it will be depleted as soon as the witch is played 10 times, turning the witch into just another +2draw card. The expectation is that if one person has a witch, the other three will have 10 each, and if two people have a witch, those who don't have a witch will have 10 each, and those who do have a witch will have 5 each, and so on, so those who don't have a witch are forced to play 10 curse cards, and the 10 "right not to take a curse" cards are taken by those who used the witch. So having the first witch is a +10 win advantage and a deck dilution effect, and once someone has the first witch, having a witch yourself is a reduction of 5 curses. if 3 people have 1 witch each, it takes about 10 turns to draw a witch once every 2~3 turns. Counting the cards above after writing this far, I see "1 witch, 1 chapel, 1 village, 3 thrones, 2 laboratories, 2 gold coins, 2 silver coins," a total of 12 cards, so 10 turns after buying the witch + chapel. I think I finished a little earlier because I bought more witches than just me, but the curse must have still been in place when I bought the throne.
 
 *1266735507*[Kaizen]Talk about not using ScanSnap lately.
 I often write blog entries not only on scanners but also on gadgets and games when I am in the "bought it, received it, tried it out, and wowed" stage, but rarely do I write entries when they are quietly forgotten and gathering dust in some corner of the house.
 
 For a while after I received my ScanSnap, I was also happily scanning various things and throwing them away. But then I thought about why I was throwing things away. It's to reduce the number of things I have and to increase the space I can use freely. I have a box of home appliance manuals, and if I took the rice cooker manual out of the box and scanned it, would I have more free space to use?
 
 Maybe it's different for those who already have a clean and tidy room, but there are still books piled up all over the room, or you take a mysterious box out of the closet and find it filled with T-shirts and say, "If I had these, I wouldn't have had to buy T-shirts last summer!" What a developmental stage I'm in. You have better things to do than scan books.
 
 With a scanner, you can "just scan everything without thinking about whether you should throw it out or keep it!" is a good theory, but it is a technique for maintaining an "already tidy" state, not a way for people with a room full of books to clean up their room. We need to improve our techniques for throwing away things that don't need to be scanned, or for not acquiring them in the first place. If we don't do that, we will just accumulate a pile of books one after another that we say, "I'm busy right now, so I'll scan them later. In addition to "I'll read it later," there will be a pile of "I'll scan it later and throw it away. Why is there a Kaiji I bought at a convenience store in the "let's scan it later" pile? Keeee! I'll throw them away!

I read "The Art of Tidying Up</a>," and the five-story tower of cardboard boxes that had been piled up in the middle of my room unopened for nine months since I moved in has been cleared away, and I've cleaned up enough to pull out the hot carpet, but there are still things in the closets and on the shelves. It was only yesterday that I found a T-shirt from an unopened box in the back of the closet. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4840123411?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&  <a href=" creativeASIN4840123411">Simply put it away! <a href=" creativeASIN=4840123411">The things you need are right at your fingertips! I learned from this book that the skill to keep things tidy and the skill to put things away are two different things. For example, it is often written in books on organizing that "it is good to make a space for the time being," but this is based on the premise that "a home position is prepared where you should put the things, and when you are done with work or when you want to change your mind, you return to that position. People who are tidy think this is a prerequisite, so they don't mention it often. However, people like me and the author of this book have not mastered this prerequisite, so we end up with "clumps of things that we put away for the time being" all over the place. It is no good trying to use advanced skills before you have mastered the basic premise. You have to improve step by step.
 
 So I guess the ScanSnap was premature for me. I should have introduced it when I had more things to do.
