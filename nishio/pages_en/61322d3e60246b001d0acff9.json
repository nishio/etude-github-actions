Failed thinking by doing the same thing over and over again.
A variant of [type thinking that was similar in the past

There are those who think that "the same thing has been done many times before and all have failed, so this time it will fail too" in response to the current attempts being made.
　Is it "the same thing?"
　　If you look at the details, the surrounding conditions, etc., are different each time, so I am merely saying that "they look the same to me as a result of abstraction by some standard".
　　How closely is the speaker in a position to observe the current situation?
　　　Often they are totally out in the open and have little information.
　　　　That would make everything look the same to you.
　　　　These people's opinions are worthless.
　Is it true that "everything failed?"
　　This depends on what you define as success.
　　Often people fantasize about "great results" that ignore the constraints of reality and then describe themselves as "failures" because they do not materialize.
