Display and organize each Scrapbox page as an item
[https://gyazo.com/eab30e0ea204f3f6df0f241e65d8d047]
	I just poured in the text from Scrapbox using [Multi-line import].
	Would "[display and organize each line of Scrapbox as a sticky]" be more appropriate?
	If there are links in a line, bring up both the entire line and the individual links.
