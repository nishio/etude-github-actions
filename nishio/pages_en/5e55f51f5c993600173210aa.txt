Improved style change UI

　I want an after-the-fact style change.
　Change "Current Style" from the menu
　Change style after the fact] after making a selection.
　Right now it's a text menu, but I'd like to make it graphical.
　Should be the same for both pathways.
　Create a dialog
　Better to paint on canvas than to work hard on DOM, unity of appearance
　When I select a pen and change the style, does the current pen color change as well?
　　If that is OK, then the "current style" change can be a style change for an empty selection.
　　Let's just follow that policy for now and get a dialog from the balloon menu after making a selection.

　We made it this far.
　　Semi-transparency (used for marker-like emphasis) and dotted lines still don't work well together.
　　In the first place, the transparency is not a style, which is a specification of PAPER.
　　I didn't save it on the server, or something.
　　It's a bit of a mess, like it looks different when you're tangled up in those things, but then you reload it and it goes back.

	[translucent and dotted] Got it.


　In the future [the style currently selected should be visible on the screen].
