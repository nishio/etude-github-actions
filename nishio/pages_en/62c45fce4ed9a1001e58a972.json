code::
 Over 200 classes were generated for component styled.div with the id of "sc-gKXOVf".
 Consider using the attrs method, together with a style object for frequently changed styles.
 Example:
   const Component = styled.div.attrs(props => ({
     style: {
       background: props.background,
     },
   }))`width: 100%;`

An article I happened to see

　Very important story.
　[Bicycle parable]
　　There are certainly things you don't know unless you try.
　　But it's negligence on the part of those who teach to use "there are elements that you don't understand until you try it" as an excuse and skip verbalizing the whole thing as "something you don't understand until you try it".
　　Some things should be communicated in language.
