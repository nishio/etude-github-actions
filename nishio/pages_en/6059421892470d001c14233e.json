I'd like to, but haven't started yet."
	When you say, "I want to do it, but I'm stuck because I don't know what the next step is," the next step is basically to "gather information to be able to know what the next step is.
	There are "people with zero choices," "people with one choice," and "people with many choices." People with zero choices don't know what their next step should be; people with one choice may not be the right choice, but there is only one path, so they go ahead without hesitation. When there are many choices, there are those who stop and say, "Which is the best choice?" and there are those who choose the one that looks good and go on.
	0 people should gather information. Specifically, for example, if you want to make a game, you should find out what the kind of game you want to make is made of. Those who are confused because they have many choices should understand that "I don't have the knowledge to choose the best option right now. You should roll the dice and make a decision because you are wasting your time worrying about it.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon] I received a question about what to say to someone when they "want to do something but haven't started", so I'd like to think about that.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "untouched" is that "untouched"?
[nishio.icon]A situation where someone says they want to do something, but they haven't done it yet.
[nisbot.icon]What "state" is that "state"?
[nishio.icon]The reason why they are not doing it is either because they say they want to do it, but they really don't want to do it, or they really want to do it, but they are stuck because they don't know what the next step is.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "condition"?
[nishio.icon]Let's delve into the latter this time. When you don't know what the next step is, the next step is basically to "do the information gathering to be able to know what the next step is," but maybe this isn't quite right.
[nisbot.icon]What is that "one step you can see"?
[nishio.icon]For example, if the other person says, "I want to make a game," if you know what you're doing, you can come up with several options: "Do I use Siv3D, Unity? Or HackforPlay or Scratch?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "HackforPlay?Scratch" is that?
[nishio.icon]NGKW HackforPlayï¼ŸScratch
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "person" is that "person"?
[nishio.icon]There are "people with zero choices," "people with one choice," and "people with many choices." People with 0 don't know what their next step should be; people with 1 may not have the right choice, but there is only one path, so they go ahead without hesitation. When there are many choices, there are those who stop and say, "Which is the best choice?" and those who choose the one that looks good and go on.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Well, I hope this exchange will be a catalyst for those who are stuck at this point to start making progress.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that "person"?
[nishio.icon]0 people should gather information. Specifically, for example, if you want to make a game, you should find out what the kind of game you want to make is made of. People who are confused because they have many choices should understand that "I don't have the knowledge to choose the best option right now. You should roll the dice and make a decision because you are wasting your time worrying about it.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "person"?
[nishio.icon]Well, I am speaking from my imagination because I am in a place where I cannot observe directly.

 Where is this "person"?
[nishio.icon]I don't know. It's not in my observation range.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "understand" is that "understand"?
[nishio.icon]For example, if you ask a question or apply to the Unexplored Junior's Question Box, you will be in my observation range. Then I can give you better quality advice.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "I" is that "I"?
[nishio.icon]People who like to see people who have stopped moving by giving advice.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen regarding that "person"?
[nishio.icon]What, to me? Well, I'd be happy if someone who has been stuck by my advice starts moving and creates something interesting, and then says, "Your advice gave me the motivation to do it! I'd be happy if they say, "Your advice motivated me!
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "person" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]What happens to me? You should simply increase the amount of advice you give. Subsequent development is a stochastic event, so if you want to increase it, you should increase the number of times you go to bat.
[nisbot.icon] Can you do that with regard to "people"?
[nishio.icon]In the meantime, maybe we should work on feedback for the next [unexplored junior] application?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "unexplored junior" is that "unexplored junior"?
