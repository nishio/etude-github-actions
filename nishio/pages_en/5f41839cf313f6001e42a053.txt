frequency table
　When there are N numbers and N is too large to do O(N^2)
　If the order of the numbers is meaningless and the number type is M, which is much less than N
　Creating a frequency table by type can reduce the amount of calculations.

[frequency→triangular number]
	For any pair of two choices of N numbers, the case where two have the same value is counted
	A naive loop is O(N^2)
	Count the frequencies and for each value frequency n [triangular number][$ T_{n-1} = n(n-1)/2]
　　This would be O(N)
