Q: It's been six months.
 A: Very good
 　No automatic bracketing, so it doesn't break the link experience, and it hits the search properly.
 　I should have observed with more resolution that "don't post mechanically."
 　　When the "List of Recently Updated Pages" goes from "List of Human Activities" to "List Including Machine Activities," it gets in the way of seeing human activities.
 　　Automatic creation of bracketing causes [the problem of too large links] and decreases the value of the link.
 　There is no real harm in pouring in old articles with old update dates and times without adding links.
 　　Maybe "automatically importing Tweets a month after posting" would do no real harm.
