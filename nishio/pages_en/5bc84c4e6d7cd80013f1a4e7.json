dumpfb
Something I made a long time ago to export Facebook activity logs to a file.

	2018-10-20 node-webkit was old and rewritten to work with pure browser
 	However, unlike the previous version, which was grinding the DOM more and more and spitting it out to files, it is heavy because it inevitably piles more and more on the DOM.
		Now I would use [Puppeteer]...
