 *1335612941*Don't take ideas with a grain of salt - how to get people from all over the world to help you.
 We came to <a href='http://info.nicovideo.jp/conference/cho-engineer-meeting/'>Super Engineer Meeting - Happy Hacking! Hacking!
 
 <Theme: Don't take your ideas with a grain of salt - How to get people from all over the world to help you.
 >>
 Do you have an interesting idea but no time to create it?"
 
 An idea is as good as nothing if you don't create it and put it out into the world. Based on my experience of working with Ukrainians to complete an idea that was once almost salted away, I will talk about the advantages of crowdsourcing.

 *1335615379*Logic Puzzle: Cowardly Liar 2
 The last <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20120427/1335523143'>Logic Puzzle: Cowardly Liar</a> was generated by Alloy and I solved it to make sure it was solvable before releasing it to the public, However, I have not solved the puzzle yet, because it seems to be working fine for the moment. However, it seems to be more likely that I make a mistake in transcribing the puzzle than that Alloy makes a mistake.
 
 ** General
 
 The characters are either liars or honest. Then they make statements such as "X is a liar" or "X is a coward. If the speaker is honest, all statements are true. A cowardly liar tells only one lie; there are three liars and three cowards among the five.
 
 ** Q1
 
 The problem of three "liars" in a loop.
 
 E: B is a liar
 B: No. C is a liar.
 C: No, no, no, E is a liar, and also D.
 E: C is a coward.
 D: The liar is A.
 A: Hmmm, I don't deny that, but D and E are cowards.
 D: It's B that's cowardly.
 B: No, no, no, A.
 
 ** Q2
 
 The problem of four "liars" in a loop.
 
 C: B is a liar
 B: D is a liar
 D: E is a liar
 E: C is a liar
 A: ......D is a liar
 D: A is a coward.
 A: It's E that's cowardly.
 E: No, B.
 B: No, no, no, it's E.
 C: Hmmm, I think D is the coward.
 
 ** Q3
 
 Problem of lying paths merging once separated.
 
 A: Lying is e
 E: No, C is a liar. And B, too.
 C: Ummm, D is a liar.
 B: I agree with that, D is a liar.
 D: A and B are cowards.
 B: It's E that's cowardly.
 C: Yeah, I agree. It's E that's the cowardly one.
 A: No, it's C.
 
 ** Aside.
 I used to draw the diagrams by hand when making these problems, but then I thought to myself, why not have Alloy output them as well? The arrow with L means "X says Y is a liar" and the arrow with C means "X says Y is a coward.

 This is the same as Q1, just with a different mapping of people.
 
 
 [f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120428211813p:image]
 Is this the same as Q3?
 
 
 [f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120428211812p:image]
 I'm not familiar with this one. Two loops of three people have been created to call me a liar. Probably a new species, Q4.
 
 
 [f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120428211811p:image]
 This is probably the same as Q1. I am beginning to think that I would like to automate the determination of whether they are the same or not. If I stop naming people, I wonder if the graphs with the same shape will disappear on their own from symmetry.
 
 
 [f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120428211810p:image]
 Is this actually the same as Q1, even though the shape is very different?
 
 
 [f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120428211809p:image]
 This is Q3.
 
 
 [f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120428211808p:image]
 Hmmm, this is an unfamiliar shape. There are five C's. Oh, two of them are bidirectional? A new species, Q5.
 
 
 [f:id:nishiohirokazu:20120428211807p:image]
 This is the same as Q5 in that L is looped by three people, and one of them has an arrow going in and an arrow going out, but there is no bidirectional C. I guess it's a new species. q6.
