 tokoroten: read tama no koshikake vol.2. 35 yrs old cute, 35 yrs old.ã€€I'm sure he's an HPC researcher...
 dmikurube: I know your husband very well.... . w
 tokoroten: ah, I knew it... Jujo-kun looks like @nishio before his marriage.
 voluntas: I'd like to read the comic that @nishio is in
 tokoroten: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4832267140/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247 &creative=7399&creativeASIN=4832267140">Tama no Koshikake 1 (Manga Time Comics)</a> You can probably meet @nishio before he got married, because the author's husband is too much on our side.
 voluntas: the only difference between @nishio before marriage and @nishio after marriage is whether it has an external storage device or not.

 It's like an FPU (good at computation but lacking versatility) with a CPU and external storage, maybe.
 
 PS: When I saw the image of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4832267140/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& Creative=7399&creativeASIN=4832267140">Tama no Koshikake 1 (Manga Time Comics)</a>, and I said "Oh, it's an absolute area when I peel off the obi" and my wife said "You may be fooled by the cute picture, but it's 35 years old. It is a secret that we exchanged a few words.
