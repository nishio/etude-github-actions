 *1330861701* I saw the Jackson Pollock exhibit.
 Well, I was under the impression that he was an "ink blotter," but it's not good not to eat.

 The Pollock exhibition was interesting. I thought it was just ink dripping, but it was surprisingly controlled from a close distance, and the artist corrected it afterwards. I also liked the ink painting style.

 A day after that, I realized something more important. There was a person's life there, I guess. A young age that didn't go poof. Trial and error, imitation of others (like Milo). Jealousy of those who succeeded before him (Picasso, etc.). Discovery of an original technique, public attention and success. Then boredom with that method and the challenge of a new method. The world ridicules his challenge as if he had turned his hand back. Suffering, drinking, and death.
 
 Public recognition has nothing to do with your efforts or the quality of your work, so why don't you just make what you want to make without worrying about what the world thinks of you? You can say such things because you are a stranger to the world, but would you really feel that way if you were in the same position?
