They raise mysterious expectations and disappoint you on their own.

>[4mimizu https://twitter.com/4mimimizu/status/1406863710275006466]: I am giving a "visual thinking course" for a company next week.
>Originally, the request was for a "graphic recorder training course," but as I listened to what they had to say, I realized that they needed the [visual thinking] skills that recorders possess in drawing in real time, so I changed the direction of the course.

>[4mimizu https://twitter.com/4mimimizu/status/1406864627032477698]: "I want to be able to grareko!" When I heard people say "I want to be able to do grareco...
>> I want to draw a nice stick figure.
>> I'd like to try one at an event.
> >I want to draw a little illustration.
>> I want to draw a note
>> I want to use it for [facilitation
>> I want to do some visual thinking
>> I want to use it for business
> Hearing is important because it is really disjointed.

>[4mimimizu https://twitter.com/4mimimizu/status/1406865742457229317]: I think "I can grareko" has as many different ranges as "I can speak English".
>from the level of being able to greet people to the level of conducting complex negotiations.
>I want to make the front door wide, but I want to keep showing the depth and possibilities of the endless visual language.

>[4mimimizu https://twitter.com/4mimimizu/status/1406866609709322241]: Visual thinking, in Japan, is somewhat like thinking while drawing a picture, but what and how to think is Visual thinking is a way of thinking while drawing pictures. I don't think it is yet clear what and how to think visually. I don't think that mechanically drawing pictures = visual thinking.

>[4mimimizu https://twitter.com/4mimimizu/status/1406867376268726273]: "Grareco makes you logical!" I feel that the hand skills to draw and the way of thinking are connected, but they are competing against each other. I think it's because the thinking of a person who was originally logical becomes visible visually, and the work of a logical person to translate it into pictures is rare, so maybe it looks like GRARECO = logical.

>[4mimimizu https://twitter.com/4mimimizu/status/1406868356603408386]: I'm glad to see "Graleco" spreading, but it's painful to see the technology there, such as "Graleco will make you logical / make you earn money / find a way to live". It pains me to see that there are more expectations than what is expected. The only thing Grareco can do is graphic recording. You need to find a way of thinking, a business mindset, and a way of life separately.

>[4mimimizu https://twitter.com/4mimimizu/status/1406869362649141250]: I'm seeing a whole stream of "design thinking" getting too many mysterious expectations, being worshipped by non-existent [silver bullets], and then being disappointed on its own. So I feel that I would like to dismantle the expectations that mysteriously gather around "Graleco" observed around me each time.
