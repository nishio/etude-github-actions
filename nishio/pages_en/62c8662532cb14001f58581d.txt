After all, isn't everything subjective to oneself?
[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork]
>In the process of writing it all down and trying to summarize it, I find myself thinking, "Isn't this all subjective? and I don't know what I should base my recommendation on with confidence.

It's [subjective] to say, "This and that seem to be related," and "This group is, in essence, like this." That is not the part that Jiro Kawakita took issue with.

Suppose that you look at the data, and before looking at it carefully, you think, "This is what it must be like," and organize the data according to that idea. This is "taking into account [* prior subjectivity]". When you organize the data in this way, you tend to ignore data that does not fit well. This is the problem.
