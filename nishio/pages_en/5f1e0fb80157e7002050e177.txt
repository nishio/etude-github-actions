How can we communicate when we have different meanings of words?
[joint note]?
It's possible you're mistaken in thinking you can do it.
 Are we all acting like we know what we're talking about when we don't?
 You don't understand that you don't understand itself.
  There is no reason to believe that you can know whether you know or not.
  The public cannot know if you know or not.
  Acting on the assumption that you don't know what you're doing is high cost, so you usually act on the assumption that you do know what you're doing.

Spiral encoding of number concepts
　Just as the spiral was a natural representation of the concept of number, there needs to be a natural representation of the concept of meaning (as opposed to vectors).
　　[Learning to add]
　　What is Nature?
　　　Low computational load
   　What is an operation on meaning?
   　　For example, inversion of meaning
   　　Natural units of meaning do not have a one-to-one correspondence with words
   　　　If an operation is frequently used, it is more efficient to create a word that describes the operation itself than to create a new word.
   　　　Not X" "not X
   　　　Auxiliary verbs and case particles
   　　[same relation of meaning].
   　　[The mapping of words to sets of individuals is a metaphor for containers.]
	[finite and recursive]

[Mapping layers of meaning]

chain of suspicion
A: An approach that builds on top of the axioms

usefulness
realization
B: Digging approach

C: An approach that seeks to understand through observation

Both B and C are the same in terms of [digging deeper with questions
　Different methods of verification?
　The method of verification is the same as the composition, but different in the weight that humans place on it.

　　Real profit by output to the world
　　　Crying and screaming to get toys, etc.
　　　Start to improve the output with the input as to whether the actual benefit is obtained or not.
　　　It's a cycle after the fact.
　　Gaining understanding with input from around the world
　　　This is the approach of trying to understand by observation
　　　Begins manipulation of the world in an attempt to gain new input
　　　　experiment
　　　[Understanding is just a hypothesis, and when you think you understand something, it doesn't mean it's right.
　　　　Need to output and verify
　　　　This idea is not self-evident.
　　　　Human civilization acquired it rather late.
　　　　Even Aristotle believed the false understanding that "heavy things fall faster" without verifying it.
　　　It's a cycle after the fact.

　　The right is easier to understand because the goal is to increase the real benefit.
　　Left?
　　　Seeing what you want to see is the real benefit
　　　Understanding what you want to understand is the real benefit.
　　　Here's the problem, even if you don't understand correctly, you are satisfied with the feeling of "understanding".
