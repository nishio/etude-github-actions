 凸 N 角形の[三角形分割の個数]
 	Consider a convex polygon consisting of n + 2 edges, divided into n triangles by drawing lines connecting the vertices so that they do not intersect each other. The number of cases for this division is the Catalan number Cn.
 With n branches (n + 1 leaves) [number of binary trees].
