Shuji Hamaguchi's definition of innovation
[Shuji Hamaguchi] [Definition of innovation].
	Never seen or heard of it.
		Of course, there must be something new, something that has not been seen or heard of before.
	be executable
		1 requirements and can be realized in a given scope and time frame.
	generate discussion
		There must always be agreement and disagreement, and no consensus must be formed.
		>When a concept is presented, if half of the participants say it is interesting and the rest say it is not, and tension is created, it is an innovation. Conversely, if everyone agrees or disagrees, it is not innovation. This is because innovation involves uncertainty, since it is an attempt to create something that has never been seen or heard of before. No matter how much we discuss uncertainty, we cannot agree. What we can agree on is the decision to choose A or B.
