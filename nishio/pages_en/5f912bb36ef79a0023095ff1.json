　Thoughts.
　　When two steps, the top is 2.
　　the time for disasters (similar to 'the witching hour' but not midnight)
　　　3 in a normal arrangement.
　　　For example, 5 1 2 4 3 would be two, so the top would be 2.
　　　Similarly, we can do the same for 4.
　　the time of the four stages of life (birth, old age, disease, death)
　　　7 1 2 6 3 4 5 and the top is 2 2 3 4 4 which is 3
　　Hypothesis: Top only moves in the range of median plus or minus 1?
　Official Explanation
　　Hypothesis is incorrect.
　　If two squares have the same value, then the two squares above them have the same value, regardless of the other squares.
　　　When thinking about specifics, it's not a good idea to think only about the bottom layer, where the different values are lined up.
　　[Once you're in a certain state, you can't get out.]
　　[Median -> What if two have the same value?]
　problem partitioning
　　[Median]
　　[Repeated results of the same operation].
