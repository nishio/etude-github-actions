Intellectual Property Technician Level 1 28th Q22
Contract reading comprehension questions with no prerequisite knowledge required
	A: If Company Y receives a lawful disclosure of the same information from Company Z, then Company Y has no further obligation of confidentiality
  →× 1-4 says "acquired legally from a third party without following confidentiality obligations", so if there is an NDA with Company Z, it is NG.
 d: If the disclosure was made by court order, and Company X was notified in advance, Company Y is not obligated to maintain confidentiality thereafter.
 	→×
  	It does say to give prior notice of any court-ordered disclosure.
   It doesn't say that this would remove the duty of confidentiality.
   1-5 Does the information fall under the category of "information for which written consent to disclose has been obtained from the disclosing party"?
    I don't. Because you have only "given notice" and not "received consent".
   1-3 Does it fall under "became public knowledge through no fault of either A or B"?
    Is there any attribution for the court ordered?
    I wonder if court-ordered disclosure means "not public knowledge because it was secretly shown to the court" or "made public knowledge".
