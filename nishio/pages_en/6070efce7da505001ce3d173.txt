Subject word hunting
The act of making it difficult to use a key concept used in a discussion for a suitable reason during some discussion.

The use of tone of language in reasoning is called "[tone policing]. When anger or distress is the subject of a discussion, telling someone who is expressing anger or distress "Don't be so emotional" and prohibiting them from expressing their feelings will prevent the discussion from moving forward.
