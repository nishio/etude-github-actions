Image Similarity Search
　The URL of the PNG digested locally with the md5 command matches the URL when it is uploaded to Gyazo
　But when I copy-paste an image into Scrapbox, the one automatically uploaded to Gyazo has a different URL
　　Is the content of the file different due to different server-side settings for converting to PNG, etc.?
　　I downloaded this image and looked at the md5 and it matched the URL.
　Hard to determine if the same image is in the original image, the image posted to Twitter and served by twimg, the image saved locally, or the image pasted into Scrapbox.

　　[imgsim] and ImageHash.
　　The former winds up using Torch to create a 768-dimensional feature vector.
　　Maybe a companion to [clip-ViT-L-14].
　　The latter feels like no machine learning.
	　　The latter sounds like a good fit.
　　It was found that ImageHash can determine that images uploaded by pasting with different hash values are identical.
