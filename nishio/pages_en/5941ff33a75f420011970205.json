avalanche of associations
	Associations call for associations, and information is flowing out of the moment one after another.
 The person is very comfortable because the pleasure of discovering new information connections and the pleasure of having them become clear occurs in rapid succession.
 How does the other party see you?
  One-sided machine gun talk
 	Typical "nerd talk."
 	Knowledge mounting, knowledge flaunting
  	He has no intention of mounting it, but he will find malice in it.
   	It's just incompetence. ref. [Don't find malice in being sufficiently explained by incompetence].
		The chain of associations is too weak to be logical, so it looks like "a lunatic talking about illogical and incoherent interpretations of me".
 There are those who are creating new knowledge and those who are simply drawing it out like a tape recorder. A distinction should be made.
 	Those who are creating knowledge are in a kind of flow state of manufacturing and cannot stop.
  	It is necessary for the recipient to have the ability to record, remember, and pass on the information....
  I want to stop the tape recorder people because they are simply too loud.

  1
  	There is a person A who does not understand a certain concept.
   B is trying to dig deeper into "what part of the story A doesn't understand," listening and nitpicking information.
   C begins to output keywords he knows in response to the keywords B has given, like a machine gun.
   A says, "Don't add unknown concepts!" and gets angry
