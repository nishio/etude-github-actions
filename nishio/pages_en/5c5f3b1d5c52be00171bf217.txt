RealURL
Original: [/RealURL].
	Chrome extension that converts and redirects URLs according to the password registered in the browser in advance when the link is 404 Not Found.
	In other words, you can link from a public place, but restrict who can see the link with a password.
	For example, if you link from this Scrapbox, which is public, to a PDF on Dropbox, usually the PDF is visible to everyone!
		https://www.dropbox.com/s/vayss2xht3t5r3h/history_of_com.pdf?dl=0
	Encrypt this URL so that only those who know the password can access it.
		https://www.dropbox.com/s/vayss2xht3t5r3h/enmrrwa_fy%5Bqzj.pdf?dl=0
	The Chrome extension automatically does the work of converting the URL with the password, so it feels the same as a normal link to the person who registered the password
	This is a very useful use case
		If a PDF file in Dropbox is a scan of an article or book that is prohibited for redistribution, for example
		If you are writing reading notes for that paper or book in a public forum, it would be useful to be able to link to the PDF from there
		However, this was not possible with the previous link because the link would be made public.
		By encrypting the URL itself with this extension, you can place the link in a public place, and only you can access it.
		Can be used in the same way as [Private Link
