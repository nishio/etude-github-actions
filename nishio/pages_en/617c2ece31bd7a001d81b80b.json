Similarity -> What is the difference?
Patterns of thought that are beneficial for increasing [cognitive resolution

When you feel "similar" to two concepts, the fact that you did not feel "this is exactly the same thing" means that you feel a "difference" there.
The "difference" is not verbalized at this time.
To equate two concepts is to ignore the differences.
Instead of equating and stopping to think, "What's the difference?" it would be easier to observe things in more detail.

　　I thought of this one first on another occasion after some time.
　　This page was blank, so I just filled it in.
