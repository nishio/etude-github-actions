　　Unexpected things collide...
　　In the meantime, I'll change the title of the Japanese one to think about what to do after importing.
		prefix: `(衝突)`

code:add_icon_on_all_pages.py
 import json
 IN_FILE = "intellitech-en.json"
 OUT_FILE = "intellitech-en-out.json"
 ICON = "[en.icon]"
 data = json.load(open(IN_FILE))
 for p in data["pages"]:
     p["lines"].append({"text": ICON})
 
 json.dump(data, open(OUT_FILE, "w"))

It's done.

Resolving Collision Pages
　Most pages are predominantly in English
　I wasn't sure what to do with just the George Edward Pelham Box.
　　There is a link to the Japanese page.
　　Decided to keep both.
