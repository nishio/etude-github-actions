embedding a state into a vector space
	[Learning the identity map]
		It was found that one-hot vectors of arbitrary dimension can be embedded in 2-dimensional space in a form that is identifiable by the perceptron
	Discrete states can be represented by one-hot vectors
	This means,
	The state is considered a two-dimensional vector.

	I was thinking about something related a long time ago: [vectorization of states].
		At this time I was thinking of constructing a direct
		Why did you want to state vectorize?
		I wanted the state transitions to be acquired and improved through learning.

	[Learning State Transition Diagrams]
		This approach is to create training data from a given state transition diagram and train it with a multilayer perceptron.
		I want to replace existing state transition diagrams written in hard code with neural nets.
		This is the same concept as [replacing the conditional clause of an if statement with a 2-class classification

	State usually [recurrent
		If this recurrent part of the system does not need to be human observable, there is no need to make it discrete.
		Then you can turn it in a compressed vector state.
