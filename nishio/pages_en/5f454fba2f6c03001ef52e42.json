put information on the corner
In "enclosing" puzzles such as [Slitherlink], if we focus on a corner, the number of edge lines between the corners can be 0, 1 or 2.
The case of 0 and 2 can be expressed with edge labels, but other information should be labeled in the corners.
1 corner faces 1; 2 or 1 (hereafter 21) faces 0 or 1 (hereafter 01)

Each numbered square conveys a corner number diagonally
The 3 squares turn 1 into 2. The reverse is also true.
The 2 squares are conveyed as they are.
A square of 1 makes a 1 a 0. The reverse is also true.
This can be used to propagate information diagonally, which can lead to clues such as the presence or absence of edges.
