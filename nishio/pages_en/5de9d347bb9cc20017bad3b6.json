elliptic curve
[$ y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b]
 The explanation that (a, b) satisfying this forms a group is incorrect.
 	Need to add infinity point O
 	We can make this infinite point O a group by defining the addition in a clever way so that it is the unit source

tasty addition
	[$ s = \frac{y_P - y_Q}{x_P - x_Q} ]
	[$ x_{R} =s^{2}-x_{P}-x_{Q} ]
	[$ y_{R} =y_{P}+s(x_{R}-x_{P})]
	This addition, of course, will result in the denominator of s being zero when xP = xQ
		So then we define P + Q = O

The definition of this addition does not include a or b
	Therefore, if there exists an "oracle that receives P and returns nP", then nP is obtained for any point P on any elliptic curve
	By standard, elliptic curves are chosen because it is difficult to make n from (P, nP)
		However, it is possible to obtain (P, nP) on a curve that is easy to compute
		We just need to verify that the P passed is a point on the assumed curve, but most Bluetooth devices do not verify this.
