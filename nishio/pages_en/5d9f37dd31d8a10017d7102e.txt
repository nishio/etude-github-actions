Pasta Logic Naming
2019/10/10
temporary name
Board game development code name

The ["spaghetti code" rule] has been changed significantly as a result of the [20190930 rule modification].
At first we called it ver.2, etc., but it would be better if we gave it a new development code name.
	Since "spaghetti code" is a common noun and not very googlable, how about a little twist?
	Spaghetti â†’ Pasta
