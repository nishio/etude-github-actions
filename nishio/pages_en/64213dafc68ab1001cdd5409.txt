Show the back of your foot in front of you
Improved expression of [stand tall] and [stand on tiptoes
　When you try to stretch [your back], your consciousness goes to your back.
　When you try to stand on your toes, your legs twist and you end up "standing comfortably".
　Wobbly when trying to show [instep] forward.
　　I find myself twisting my legs to try to stabilize them.
　　Solve this by [standing the pelvis up], not the feet.
　　　It's similar to the sensation called [tightening the buttocks].
