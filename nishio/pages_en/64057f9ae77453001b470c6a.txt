	There is no gunicorn.
	　Why would that be the case if there is a venv in the first place?
　	pip install -r requirements.txt
	　numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, mecab-python3, etc. are mocked up
	　Why?
	Will this go through deployment in the first place?
	　Oh, it went through.
	　Python 3.8 in Heroku.
　Local is 3.9, so there's some discrepancy.
		[mecab on heroku] also looks shady

　$ brew install python@3.8
		mecab-python3 is mocking up
			I'll put it in brew, which lacks mecab and swig to begin with.
　$ brew install llvm
　Motion!
