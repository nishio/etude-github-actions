 *1243236980*[SVG]batik memo
 I didn't note it down on my blog in the rush for MTM03, so I'll note it down before I forget.
 - batik defaults to 96 DPI
 - Output to png and jpeg but not PDF output
 -- PS: I think I can do it with batik-rasterizer
 - If you "Output to PDF" from Print, it will be a PDF.
 - However, it seemed that if the original SVG was "marginally larger" in width when printed on A4 using that method, for example, it would be scaled down to fit on the page, including that margin. I will write code later to make the SVG's width exactly the same as the rendered one.
 - Oh, and a code to properly calculate how many pixels A4 is at 96 DPI and cut it at that size.
 
 *1243243963*Subtle milk
 I just drank some milk and it was very astringent. I was surprised and looked at the expiration date and saw that the expiration date before opening was 5/6. Should I not drink milk two weeks past the expiration date? I have no problem with Pirkle, which has an expiration date of 4/20.
