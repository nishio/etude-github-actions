 *1191899614* From my cell phone.
 
 I woke up at 7:00, but I slept twice and was late.
 
 *1191920288* one paragraph
 
 When you have finished your work, do you wonder what to do next?
 More and more time is lost while worrying...
 I'd like to tinker with Aoi or PLY, but I'm on hold.
 
 *1191920413* Regarding yesterday's diary and photos
 
 Only the first photo is being treated specially....
 Is only the first one treated as "one of the day"?
 I mean, it's still treated as "today" even though it's in blog mode.
 
 *1191927709* Uninstall List
 
 I often see "install lists" that tell what was installed on a new machine, but I don't see many "uninstall lists". (Maybe because there is no demand for it?).
 I'm about to delete some extra stuff since the hard disk of my laptop is getting tight, so I'm going to make an uninstall list for the sake of it.
 Note that many of the Python-related files are not Python--; (they are there because they were installed, so deleting them will only return them to 0).
 
 Current HDD free space 1.69GB
 For now, let's try to sort them by size in "Add or Remove Programs".
 First, MS Office...I don't use it much, but I need it occasionally, so I can't delete it.
 Second place, J2SE6, which also cannot be deleted.
 Third place, Glasgow Haskell Compilar. why is it so big?
 Fourth place, J2SE5. hmmm. I can't turn this one off, either.
 Fifth, OpenOffice, which I installed in the hope that it would be easier to embed SWFs in PowerPoint when I was having trouble embedding them in PowerPoint, but it ended up being sadly unused because it was not displayed in the presentation mode, which is the most important part, even though it was displayed in the preview of the editing screen. But in the end, I never used it. Good bye.
 Sixth, Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition. mmmm. I don't know what to do.
 Seventh, OneNote 2003...what to do with that one too?
 8th, JRE can go away.
 Ninth place, Python 2.4 pyusb, which I'm saving for a story.
 Tenth, JRE can go away.
 Eleventh, JRE can go away.
 Twelfth, Windows Live Messenger. I don't even start it in the first place.
 Thirteenth, Ruby.
 Fourteenth, .NET Framework 2.0 Japanese LanguagePack
 
 After writing all this, I realized that it is easier to use list notation.
 - Python 2.4 biopython, I don't need it for 2.4.
 - Python2.4 eGenix mx Base Package
 - Python2.4 pygame
 - Python 2.4 Django; I don't need this because Django is put in with svn. Oh, shoot, I should have made it a "I have to REMOVE Django" story anyway.
 - Python2.3 py2exe
 - Python2.3 rpy
 - Python2.3 pywin32
 - Python2.3 SendKeys
 - Python2.3 wxPython
 - Python 2.5 numpy, this leaves
 - Python2.4 mod_python
 - Python2.4 PIL
 - Python2.4 pysqlite
 - Python2.4 rpy
 - Python 2.4 scipy, erased so far.
 - AcrobatReader I need this.
 
 The free space is now 2.29 GB. Hmmm. Not so good.
 
 *1191945673* Got a bad one.
 
 Too funny.
 
 However, it doesn't work properly on my machine when I launch it with a browser. I'll have to buy a new machine. I wonder if it will work on a Mac, or if it will work properly with Parallel.
 
 *1191953028* Too much fun.
 
 It's already 27:00.
 Also, I cut my nails too much and they bled.
 
 
 *1191958016* High runaway power at night
 
 Because of the high runaway power, weird stuff came out of my brain,
 It would be a shame to go straight to sleep and disappear, so I get up to write it down and eventually can't sleep.

 <body>X41t had a bad HDD. <BR>The 1.8" HDD is specially used and cannot be replaced. <BR>...Any good solutions? <br>Here is what I can think of. <br>→Solution 1: High capacity SDHC card (16G) and SDHC card adapter. <br>→Solution 2: High-capacity CF card (16G) and CF adapter. <br>The external HDD is the best for cost performance. <br><br>I don't know how good it is, but there is also the x61t. </body>
