最大流に帰着
The majority of the problems that are ultimately attributed to the maximum flow and solved.
　First, it comes down to the minimum cut problem.
　Eliminate negative edges and make it a maximum flow problem.
　Solve with the maximum flow library
And it's confusing to think about flow when you're trying to get to the minimum cut problem, so I moved it to [attributed to minimum cut].

Write here if there is a problem, like using the maximum flow instead of the minimum cut.
