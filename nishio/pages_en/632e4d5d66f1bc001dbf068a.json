coach's ear
>[https://twitter.com/damadama777/status/1573433517601882113?s=21&t=fmWnIlglRq28hkorJmvOtg @damadama777]: when you are over 40, the people who give you [advice that hurts your ears]. around you will decrease drastically. It's no wonder, because pointing out other people's issues is a task for everyone that takes a lot of time and effort and only risks being resented. I think the day will soon come when it will be commonplace for individuals to request [coaching], just as companies hire [management consultants] to obtain useful advice.
