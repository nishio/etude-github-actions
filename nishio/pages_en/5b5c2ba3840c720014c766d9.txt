[*** what is intellectual production?]
Intellectual production is the use of knowledge to create value. Writing and programming are probably the easiest examples to imagine. But there are opportunities for intellectual production in all sorts of other jobs as well. I believe that creating new knowledge on one's own is important for high-value intellectual production. Simply using knowledge given to you by others will not add much value.

Let's consider a programming example. Simply copying sample code from a textbook will often not accomplish the objective you want to achieve. To accomplish your objective, you need to crunch the sample code, understand it, modify it to fit your situation, combine it, and create a new program. The same is true for intellectual production techniques. You need to modify, combine, and create new methods, not just copy knowledge from a book.

[*** benefits of reading this book]
Readers can learn about intellectual production techniques by reading this book. I recommend this book as the best way to learn about intellectual production techniques.

Here are some comments from reviewers of the book's manuscript.
 I realized something I wasn't aware of.
 I could verbalize what I was doing unconsciously.
 Very motivating, full of things that will be useful in the future.

I am excited because I feel that the book has stimulated me to notice [blind spots] and to [verbalize] my experiences, and I feel that I can improve further in the future.

On the other hand, there are opinions to the contrary.
 not keeping one's feet on the ground
 "So, what do I do?" I don't know what to do.

If you don't have the right materials, [bonding] won't happen. The "ground" is [experience]. If you didn't feel right after reading this book, unfortunately, you didn't have enough material this time. But that's okay. Experience will accumulate in you day by day, and one day you will connect with it. Read it again after six months. Something will probably change.
