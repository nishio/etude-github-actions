I want to read PDFs on my iPad.
	GoodReader
 	Can be displayed in two separate pages.
  Change swipe direction for Japanese PDF?
		You can download what you put in Dropbox.


	LiquidText
 	Can connect excerpts from multiple sources in a KJ-legal manner
  ...although the concept is interesting.
		Two options: read from local or by specifying a URL?

  I haven't tried.
  Not that I read PDFs?
