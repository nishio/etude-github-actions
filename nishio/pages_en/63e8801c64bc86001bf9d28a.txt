	[/villagepump/new-door-opened] is interesting, but I too was unable to cut it out for fear of breaking it!
	　So I backed it up here.

 I don't know how to describe it, but I feel like [a new door has opened].
 Until now, my [output of images] has been limited to [illustrations] in black marker on a white background for explanations.
 　A World in Black and White? [/villagepump/issac.icon].
 I had tried [sketching] while looking at the real thing, but I thought, "Why not just use a photograph?
 There were no images in the virtual world of my brain.
 　There was no [non-existent world I wanted to depict].
 　I didn't have the ability to [imagine] the non-existent world in a visual way.
 For a while now, I've been doing the "make an image with [drawing AI] -> judge whether it's good or bad" thing, and it's like "I put water pressure on a pipe that was clogged and it started to flow.
 　I don't know how to say this.
 　When I was not aware and thinking before [I was able to move things that I couldn't move].
 　　I felt similar to when I started playing sports[/villagepump/issac.icon].
 　　　Clearly perceive the presence of previously unrecognized body movements and muscles, and try new ways to move them.
 　　　　This is fun.
 　　　It could be when using a ball, shinai, stick, or other equipment.
 　　　　I think of it as a kind of elongation of one's [physical senses] through the tools.
 　　Indeed. I was doing [draw-in] recently and I was like, "I see, this is [pelvic floor muscles]"[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　　 There's something about muscle training that feels like recognizing the existence of muscles first.
 				There is[/villagepump/Haruhi.icon][/villagepump/issac.icon].
 					Mr. [Sekihara] told me that you can't train effectively unless you are aware of where on your body you are working out properly.
 					Mr. Sekihara=person
 					Same with running, etc.
 　[If you compare it to a crane game, you used to be able to move the crane only left and right, but then you realized there was a button to move it in the depth direction, and you thought, "If I press this button, the crane will move back and forth! It's like "I can push this button and it moves back and forth!
 I'm really curious what you're talking about[/villagepump/Haruhi.icon][/villagepump/inajob.icon][/villagepump/issac.icon][/villagepump/kimoto.icon].
 　I've done my best to verbalize it, but if that doesn't get the message across, then it's "just sprouting" and I think the only thing to do is to "wait until it grows big."[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　It appears to be an XX [increase resolution] phenomenon, but I wasn't sure what XX was. Drawing? [/villagepump/inajob.icon].
 　When I say "increase the resolution," I feel uncomfortable because I imagine a situation where something that was originally dimly visible is now clearly visible[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　This one is closer: [/nishio/fog of literacy].
 　It's like something that wasn't visible at all is starting to appear dimly.
 　I have a feeling that the emphasis will be on "[moving]"[/villagepump/issac.icon].
 　I learned that I could move areas I wasn't using.
　　　　　Sensation of moving muscles in muscle training, sports, etc.
　　　　　Likewise, did you know that there is an area of the mind that "imagines images of the virtual world" that we have never been aware of?
 　I got it to work more when I moved it, interesting! like[/villagepump/issac.icon].
 　This is what I expect from [InstaChord] (aside).
 　Good story[/villagepump/nishio.icon][/villagepump/inajob.icon].
 　I think this is pretty close[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　Maybe it's the acquisition of new self-expression[/villagepump/issac.icon].
 Just as we were able to [paradigm shift with Scrapbox], maybe we can shift again with drawing AI[/villagepump/sta.icon].
 I want to remember this as [advantage of trying something new][/villagepump/kidooom.icon].

[/villagepump/inajob.icon]
	I first wrote an application that allows you to play chords while studying [music theory].
		After that, he learned [electronics] and made [RakuChord] as a hardware.
		In the process, I realized that playing the piano with both hands (if you play it in a kindergarten teacher way) doesn't seem to be a superb skill.
			I think there was a sense of [a new door opening] in this area.
			I recently found this[/villagepump/basic.icon].
		And [InstaChord] is having fun.
	An example of how learning electronics in the first place opened new doors.
	[There was also the term "aha experience.
		This one is more like a light "awareness"?
	I think I've started to look at plastic products as "something to make" since I bought a [3D printer].
	　I don't have any knowledge of [injection molding] yet, though,

There is a higher level of abstraction and a lower level of abstraction[/villagepump/Haruhi.icon].
	The former is "a new door (opens)" and the latter is its content, which is concerned with [new door opened#63ad9797aff09e00000cdd6c].
		(I'm still curious about the latter.)
	Interpreted again, it's like a GPU in the head that started to move?
		It was about on-board.

The boundaries are becoming clearer and clearer with all the different opinions[/villagepump/nishio.icon].

　I don't feel that the performance of anything existing has been improved, but rather that new features have been added.
　　Not 1 became 10, but 0 became 1.
　　Both are increasing in number, so to someone else it might be, "Isn't that an improvement in performance?" to others.
　　But he does not feel that it is an improvement in performance. because he was not aware of it when he was 0, so there is no comparison.
　It has to do with "moving it."
　　Cannot be moved at 0.
　　I'm now at 1 so I can move it.
　　Maybe by moving it, it will increase to 10.

[/villagepump/basic.icon].
 There is a sense in which the skill of illustration does not grow linearly with the amount of practice, but rather in steps in the extreme, and this is something that others have often said
  Various people express it in terms of being able to do that when they become "aware."
  Could it be something close?


[** Observe changes due to [InstaChord]]
from [2023/01/03]
[/villagepump/nishio.icon]
　Let's compare going from not being able to draw at all to being able to generate pictures with AI to going from not being able to play an instrument at all to being able to play it with InstaChord.
　Ah, I see, so there is an increase in the axis of "something to play" as well as the perception that a song is "something to listen to" (observation).
　　Level 1: The
　　　Recognizes a song as "something to listen to" and does not recognize the possibility of playing it himself
　　　Recognizes illustrations as "something to look at" and does not recognize the possibility that he/she produces them
　　　This phase is "no"
　　Level 2: The
　　　Recognize the possibility of playing a song and begin to think about which one to play
　　　Realizing that I can generate illustrations, I start thinking about what to generate.
　　　This phase is the "can-do" phase.
　　　[" ["Every song you've ever heard is eligible for performance"]"]
　　Level 3: The
　　　Try to play some and recognize what is easy and what is difficult.
　　　　You'll be able to understand things like, "Oh, I see, this song modulates twice."
　　　Generate some illustrations and be able to recognize what is easy and what is difficult
　　　Maybe it's not appropriate to summarize this place with an illustration and a narrative.
　　　　The former creates from zero, the latter reproduces what is already there with good physical manipulation.
　　　　They share the "moving" aspect, but not the "making" aspect.
　　　　The "making" in music is going to be composing.
　　　　Maybe when you get used to insta-chords and gain some experience in "playing a song while watching the chord progression", a physical sense of "chord progression" will be created in your brain
　　　　If you can do that, you can try to do the chord progression on your own as you see fit.
　　　　And if you play the notes in the chord at random, you can create a melody that sounds like it, and it becomes an experience of "I'm not very good at this, but I was able to generate it from scratch".
　　　　Is this phase equivalent to the "I put in a prompt and a picture came up" phase for the image generation AI?
　　　　AI image generation feels "from scratch" but in reality, just as AI learns a lot from the past, does music generation need to learn a lot from the past first?
　　　InstaChord also said that there is "creating from zero".
	　　　>That feeling of being able to create a song as you are playing along... (With InstaChord), you can do that... Many people say that as they play with InstaChord, they gradually come to understand how a song is made. You can notice that after this chord, it often becomes this chord.
	　　　 [2023/01/05#63b620bee1daa500008fadf7]
　　I think there is a split beyond level 3.
　　　More variations of songs that can be played easily.
　　　Practice to be able to do difficult techniques.
　　　　Things like "arpeggios are hard," which I didn't recognize in the first place at level 1, are verbalized.

　It hasn't arrived yet, but now that I've ordered it, I'm asking, "What song do you think I can play?" The thought is occurring[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　 I haven't even touched it yet, so at this point, "Isn't this going to play?" is probably wrong.
　 Added on 2023-01-14
　 　I thought "The Thesis of the Cruel Angel" was difficult, but it turns out that the part I thought was difficult was actually only [3~→6], and this one wasn't that difficult.
　 　In many cases, there is a twist at the transition from the melody to the chorus, and if you limit yourself to just the chorus, the difficulty level goes down dramatically.
　 Added on 2/12/2023
　 　I thought it would be difficult, but when I tried it, it wasn't that difficult."
　 　This [pessimistic misunderstanding].
　 　By assuming it is difficult and not trying, the opportunity to know it is not difficult is lost.

　I drew what I think at this point[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　[https://gyazo.com/be41f4c1ee39a32f9f4f539eb9b9b329]
　1: I usually only move left and right.
　 I don't see the black zone, nor am I aware of its existence.
　2: Realize that you can move up as well.
　3: Surprisingly, it goes on and on.
　　I'm seeing more and more things I didn't even think were there.
　4: By extension, [I get the feeling that] "maybe we can do this."
　5: If you work toward that realization, you will find a wall.
　　Sometimes it's "what I can't do in the first place" or "what I can't do now."
　　It creates ideas such as whether to find a way to go beyond the barriers to reach a different planet to reach a star.
　　concrete example
　　　Generating "girl pictures" with drawing AI is easier than expected (3)
 　　　However, when he tried to do something like "let's have a balance as a motif of equality" or "let's make a peace in front of the guillotine," he found a wall that didn't work at all (5).
 　　　 The idea of "peace in front of the guillotine" comes from (4)
 　　　 No such idea would come to mind at stage (1).
 　　Playing the chorus of a famous song on InstaChord is easier than expected (3)
 　　 But that's "if you have 'Video Plus' where the code flows along with the video.
 　　 General, information that is just lyrics with chords attached to them can be confusing because it's hard to know "when to play" (5).
 　　  I recognized when I started doing it that often the "timing of the play" does not match the word boundaries in the first place.
 　　   Hard to spot[/villagepump/basic.icon].
 　　  Maybe I haven't developed much of a sense of "beat" yet, I haven't heard a song with that in mind.
 　　  　The 3/4 and 6/8 comparison videos made me "get it" a little.
 　　  I learned about the concept of [stroke pattern] after writing this[/villagepump/nishio.icon].

　I've made some progress on what I thought I didn't say well when I first posted it.
　　I meant to say 5.
　　But 2 would be interpreted as.
　relevance
　　[Afantasia]
　　I don't know if the "door opening" caused me to be able to "imagine" because I didn't experiment before I felt the "door" was "opened" by the drawing AI.
　　Once the "imaginary" pipe was allowed to pass through, it could be passed through with conscious pressure linguistically.

	I imagined a metaphor for mountain climbing[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
		I keep going until I get to a high mountain in front of me, and when I get there, I see another high mountain ahead of me.
		[scenery you can't see unless you stand there].
　It reminded me of [medaka]'s [aerial corridor] experiment[/villagepump/hatori.icon].

	Write how you feel now[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
  I used to think, "There are difficult songs and easy songs; let's find the easy ones and play them."
  Now the definition of "difficult" has changed.
  　Because I can now convert difficult chord notation into easy chord notation in my brain in no time.
  　I've come to believe that Yuichi was right when he said, "You don't have to choose a beginner's chord chart, just ignore the sevens and sus4s.
  　On the other hand, the swap in 3~ should not be omitted and the b in 7b should not be omitted
  　　I can now make this decision without any particular thought.
  [" I sometimes get confused because I don't know "when to play"] [" maybe I haven't developed much of a sense of "beat" yet] [" I learned the concept of stroke patterns after writing this].
　　　Play the upstroke."
　　　　When it took me so long to switch fingers, I couldn't play upstrokes because I didn't have enough time.
　　　　The concept of "beat" is clearer if you are always jerking around, not just jangling the chord changes.
　　　　The chord chart is distorted in time because the lyrics are written in kanji characters and there are many moras in one character, and there are sections of rests with no lyrics.
　　　　　We're naturally expected to compensate for that in our brains.
　　　　　Lyrics and chords are not enough information.
　　　　　When you're doing jaka-jaka, you'll know, "Oh, that's next," or "That's the pattern, 3 jaka-jaka, 1 jaka-jaka, 4 jaka-jaka.
　　The combination of "brain conversion to easy chords" and "acquisition of the concept of time signatures" has changed the way I used to be able to play only easy songs with video plus: I am now able to play songs that are easy to play and have a video plus.

   The code is simplified and the length is specified.

　　　My conversion ability improved as I repeatedly converted [Chord Progression Course for Everyone] and [All Transposition Patterns], which are not written in ICN, into ICN to check by playing them by myself.

   > I was able to get a little ahead of the commentator's explanation in terms of ease of playing in insta-chord, I feel that my music theory knowledge has advanced! [/villagepump/nishio.icon].
			I am able to doubt the given key and determine the key from the code myself.
　　I can now see terrain that was not visible before InstaChord, and I can predict where I will reach and how much it will cost.
　　　It has revealed my own desires.
　　　The animated songs I miss are not on iflet, they are not video plus.
　　　　Find chord charts from other sites and make them ICN
　　　　　I think this is about enough for me personally.
　　　　　　We are starting to be able to determine the key and make it ICN, we can do it.
　　　　　I can't play by ear, but I don't have a song I want to play that badly at the moment.
　　　Not much desire to play complex chords well.
　　　　Not much interest in improving one's physical body control performance.
　　　I'm interested in the structure of the music.
　　　　I want to know how a song I think is good is made.
　　　I'm interested in [differential sound].
　　　　That's way out of InstaChord's scope.
　　　　Can I do it if I'm familiar with DTM software? Do I implement it myself?
　　　　I'm interested in music that is not in the 12-tone scale.

　What I'm thinking now[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　Skills needed to play songs that do not have "Video Plus".
 　　Conversion from code to ICN
 　　Skill in understanding timing from chord charts where the chords are just written in the lyrics.
 　If you know the keys to the former skill, time will do it.
 　　I understand how to do it.
 　I don't know the latter skill.
 　So I was writing on a piece of graph paper or something, and I realized.
 　　In many cases, a part of the words of the lyrics is inserted in the backbeat before the chord change.

   		[https://ototama.com/music/pops/score.php?id=58 sheet music for "The Thesis of the Cruel Angel" / Ototama]
   		I was wondering if my perception was correct, so I looked it up and found just the right sheet music.
    　Words like "wind, chest, beat, me, smile" are split.
　　　　If you're like me, who hasn't developed the skills to feel the measure, you'll recognize this melody in the following blocks
　　　　　[https://gyazo.com/505502a01fcc2ede9053c887d2f3d016]
　　　　　If you play a chord at the head of this block, it will be out of alignment or out of number.
　　I felt like I took a step forward last time with "Play the Upstroke," but today I took another step forward.
　　　Better forget about the melody and lyrics.
　　　It's the melody on top of the chords, not the chords on top of the melody.
　　　Chords are more important than lyrics or word breaks.
		I wrote about a month ago: [" I recognized when I started doing it that there are often cases where the "timing of the play" does not match the word boundaries in the first place."]
			I needed time [for the words to ripen] before I could clearly explain this realization.

	[Introduction to Phenomenology: Toward a New Science and Philosophy of Mind]
		[explain phenomenology to ChatGPT and have him shove it].
			I felt I could explain "a new door opened" with a [Merlo Ponti]-like vocabulary[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
    >Heidegger divided the concept of existence into [thing-like] existence and [instrumental] existence, and considered that [skill] in using instrumental existence [discloses the world].
    >Merleau-Ponty, on the other hand, believed that the movement orientation of the subjective body provides an understanding of the world
    >Heidegger considered tools to be separate from the human body, whereas Merleau-Ponty considered the human body itself to be a tool, and even when artifacts are used as tools, they are subjectively perceived as an extension of the body

  	⭕["Notice that there is a button to move it in the depth direction].
  	❌[" increase resolution].
  	⭕[" There seems to be an emphasis on "moving it"].
　　This is a case where our understanding of the world is being promoted not by "increasing cognitive resolution" but by "improving our skills in using tools."
　　　I wrote "Merleau-Ponty-like vocabulary," but I didn't need to distinguish between Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty on this one.
　　　Can we say "phenomenological vocabulary?" Would that be the opposite, or would Husserl get mixed up and become something different...

relevance
	[real-life example of a process of deepening understanding].
　　This is a description of the process of increasing cognitive resolution in the process of playing the game "Guess my current location by looking at Google Street View"
　　I had the feeling that it was a little different than what we're talking about here.
　　Perhaps it's the difference between "increasing cognitive resolution" and "improving skill in using tools."
