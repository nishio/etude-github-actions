Save all in one place
	question (e.g. on a test)
		When viewing what you have written on the iPad on a PC, if you select multiple paths and move them around, they will be moved and redrawn one at a time.
	cause
		The useEffect triggered a change in state.items to saveToServer.
	cope
		setTimeout if not flagged by useEffect, flag it
  If it's flagged, do nothing and go through with it.
  saveToServer at the timing when setTimeout fires.

code:ts
 let toSave = false;
 useEffect(() => {
   if (toSave) {
     // do nothing
   } else {
     toSave = true;
     setTimeout(() => {
       toSave = false;
       saveToServer(isReadOnly, state, mapname)
     }, 100)
   }
 }, [state.items]);
