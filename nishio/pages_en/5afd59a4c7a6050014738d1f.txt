Ten Principles of Economics
 How people make decisions
  1: People face trade-offs (conflicting relationships)
  2: The cost of something is the value of what you give up to get it.
  	[Opportunity cost]
  3: Rational people think in marginal areas
  	What is "[marginal]"?
  		marginal
  		Minor modifications to the action plan
  4: People respond to various [incentives].
 How people influence each other
  5: Trade makes everyone richer
  6: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
  	Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand
  7: Governments can also improve outcomes brought about by markets
 How the economy works as a whole
 8: A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
 9: If the government prints too much paper money, prices will rise.
 10: Society faces a short-term tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
 	[Phillips curve]

economy model
 [flow circulation diagram].
		Goods, services and money flows
	[Production Possibilities Frontier]
		production possibilities frontier
		Mankiw states that the production possibility frontier bulges outward from the origin
			This approach assumes [increasing marginal cost

Why do economists disagree?
	Difference between empirical and normative claims
	Existence of [trade-offs
	Difference in [values] â†’ [fairness

[Interdependence] and benefits from trade
 [Opportunity cost] and comparative advantage
 	The opportunity cost of one good is the inverse of the opportunity cost of the other good

Demand and Supply Action in the Market
	[Demand curve]
		Relationship between quantity demanded of a good and its price, usually falling right
			The quantity demanded by all buyers will be added together horizontally
			[$ x = f(y) = f_1(y) + f_2(y)]
		When income increases, demand usually increases. These goods are called [normal good
			[Inferior good: Demand increases when income decreases. For example, the use of buses increases because people cannot afford cars.
		[Substituting Goods]: Lower prices for X reduce demand for Y.
			Movie Ticket and Video Rental Prices
		[Complementary Goods]: Demand for Y increases when the price of X falls.
			Gasoline and Automobiles
	[Supply curve]
		Relationship between supply of a good and its price, usually rightward
	The intersection of the two curves is the [market equilibrium point].

Three-step approach to analyze changes in equilibrium
	Identify which curve (or both) shifts
	Identify the direction of shift
	See how the shift changes [equilibrium price] and [equilibrium volume

[Elasticity]
	elasticity of demand
		When it reacts significantly to changes in price, it is "elastic".
  	x/y
			That's just a gradient.
			The greater the slope of the curve, the more "inelastic" we call it.
		It is easy to be resilient when there are closely substituted goods. If margarine is expensive, use butter.
	elasticity of supply
		This elasticity (i.e., slope) only changes the change in [total revenue](xy) when the curve shifts.
		The line of constant total income is hyperbolic

Theory of Consumer Choice
	[Budget constraint line]
	preference
		Expressing preferences by [nondiscrimination curves
			A set of points that provide the same satisfaction
		Four properties of nondiscrimination curves
			The indiscriminate curve of information is more this
			Non-discrimination curve declines to the right
			Indiscriminate curves do not intersect.
			The nondiscrimination curve bulges inward from the origin.
				This makes the assumption of diminishing marginal utility.
		Two extreme examples of nondiscrimination curves
			[Complete substitute goods]: 5 yen and 10 yen coins
			[Full complementary goods: shoes on the right foot and shoes on the left foot
