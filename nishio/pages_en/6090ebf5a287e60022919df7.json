 Thanks to nishiohirokazu for asking me to put a page on the Wiki of "How do you write?
 
 Now, what about the venue? What's the title of the conference? For now, open and free is an absolute must. We would very much like to record, edit, and distribute the conference as well as distribute it in real time.

 I was quicker to notice it by trackback than by hitting you via amachang. viva Web 2.0 (lol).
 
 Please feel free to use such a wiki if you like. Also, I would like to participate in the study group because I am personally very interested in this topic. I would like to improve the design of how to write orgs. If the number of participants is less than 30, we can rent Cybozu Labs, but in that case, at least one employee must be present, so it must be a date that either I or amachang can attend.
