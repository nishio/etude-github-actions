(5.4) It is important to repeat
In [(3.2) The common part between memory and muscle], I explained that repeating is important for making memories. In [(3.5.7.1) Making questions is chance to make memory], I explained that if you did cognitively advanced tasks, the target information goes easier to stay in memory. Thinking about the meaning of sentences is one of the cognitively advanced tasks.

In the KJ method, finding pieces that are semantically relevant and creating a nameplate to explain groups are cognitively advanced tasks. By repeating those tasks, you can create your memory efficiently.
