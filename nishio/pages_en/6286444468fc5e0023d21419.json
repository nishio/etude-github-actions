The value of being able to make stamps
>[https://twitter.com/tsukamoto/status/1527277688003899392?s=21&t=Tk3sTEdP7qC-5KO-SXtY9w @tsukamoto]: business communication shifts to [chat] and even more straightforward It's quite efficient to go through a single word and then shift to a one or two character response such as "Copy" or "Acceptable". With [Slack], it's simplified to the point where you can create a stamp with a few words and everyone can immediately use it, but with Teams, you can't create a [stamp] and that last step doesn't get any easier.
