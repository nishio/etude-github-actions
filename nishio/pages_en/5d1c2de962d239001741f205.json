Create shared links with embedded coordinates
aka [view shared link] [specify viewport by URL].

	I should be able to share with others what I see.
	The aspect ratio is different from the counterpart.
	So, embed the Rectangle in the URL and make the Zoom capable of displaying that Rect
		Center is fine as is.
	Pass Center to Zoom" is inconvenient when passing a large screen view to the iPhone.
	`&cx=155.20097005175816&cy=-159.15570591146707&left=-231.88275288159716&top=-847.4105222489367`
		With a specification like this, the zoom is now calculated and displayed in such a way that the topLeft point fits within the screen.
			If only cx,cy are specified, the standard 1.0 zoom is used and only the center is adjusted there.
		Now we just need to implement the part where we create this URL from the current view.

Create shared links with embedded coordinates
As a use case
	Show others what the editor has created.
		The viewer defaults to zoom, so the first thing you're going to say is, "Wow, how do I see that?" they'll be like, "Wow, how do I see that?
		I knew it was "Zoom to see the whole picture by default".
	 Or, the editor should be able to share the link with the zoom that the editor can see when he/she shares the link.
	â†’"Zoom to see the whole picture" is not good enough.
		What you want to show is not always the whole picture.
 		Close up of part of a larger map
 		Don't show unorganized sticky notes tucked away on the edge.
 		Don't show trash sticky notes.
 	Just use the "Create Shared Link" button to create a URL with the current coordinate system embedded.
 Is it necessary in the first place?
		From the point of view of those who "just watch."
			In the first place, if you are given something that is in a locally editable state...
			I'm nervous that I might have accidentally edited and "broken it".
			Need to read manual for operation.
			Maybe it's better to be shared in an image.
		Group availability is significant.
			If there's no group, it's just a two-dimensional arrangement of stickies, so you can share it with images.
			With the group folded, the image does not show the back of the group.
			[If there are no closed groups, then images are fine].
				Conversely, "[closing groups]" = "[compressing information]" is the key to providing value that has not been possible with images until now.
