[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon] I feel uncomfortable with the question "What is the best study for software developers to do during work hours?" but I don't know what it is, so I want to talk about it.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "discomfort" is that?
[nishio.icon]I don't know about that.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "understand" is that "understand"?
[nishio.icon]In response to your first question, I'm sure there's something I'm missing or a discrepancy in definitions, and I'd like to know what it is.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "question" is that "question"?
[nishio.icon] "What kind of study is acceptable for software developers to do during work hours?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "do it during work hours" is that "do it during work hours"?
[nishio.icon]Whether studying is work or not, and whether you should be paid for the time you spend studying.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "salary" is that?
I think [nishio.icon] implicitly means the base salary of a full-time employee. Not overtime pay or holiday premiums.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]I hope you can see what the discomfort is.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that "discomfort"?
Maybe you are uncomfortable with [nishio.icon]choices. 'everything related to software developers,' 'only things directly related to my current job,' 'only what I'm told to do.'
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "uncomfortable" feeling?
[nishio.icon] is finally in my chest.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Maybe you feel uncomfortable with your choices. 'everything related to software developers,' 'only things directly related to my current job,' or 'only what I was told to do.'
 How do you know if you are "uncomfortable" with this?
[nishio.icon]Somehow.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Maybe you feel uncomfortable with your choices. 'everything related to software developers,' 'only things directly related to my current job,' or 'only what I was told to do.'
 What does this "discomfort" seem to be?
It looks like [nishio.icon]software is behaving suspiciously. When you investigate the cause, you may find an unexpected bug.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Maybe you feel uncomfortable with your choices. 'everything related to software developers,' 'only things directly related to my current job,' or 'only what I was told to do.'
 What do you hope will happen regarding this "discomfort"?
[nishio.icon]I'd like to see this resolved. The conversation has turned to the concept of discomfort, so I'll try again: "everything related to software developers," "only things directly related to my current job," "only what I'm told to do."
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "discomfort" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]We should be more detailed.
[nisbot.icon]As for "uncomfortable", can you do that?
[nishio.icon]Let's do it!
