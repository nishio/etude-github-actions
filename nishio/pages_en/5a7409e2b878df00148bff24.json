 Concepts used in [reinforcement learning].
  exploitation-exploration trade-offs
  There are variations on whether to say "use" or "exploration" first and how to translate "exploitation.

 If one chooses an option that seems useful, the opportunity to discover that other options are more useful is lost.
  Choosing the optimal solution based on past experience prevents new searches and gets stuck in [local minima
   [epsilon_ready]: Introduce randomness for the search
 On the other hand, if they repeatedly search for more useful options, they will not benefit from the useful options they have found.
 You have to go up once to find another minima from [local minima].

   By getting information through a filter that matches your ideology, you get stuck in the [local minimum] of ideology.
