It's a hard choice to answer, only I'm sure it's not #4.

Option 1
 If you search for a keyword and find a blog or lecture material and think "oh, this looks good", if what you are looking for is not confidential, etc., now is the time to post a link to Scrapbox.
 	Write your own summary below the link.
 	This is closest to option 1, but I don't believe it's a "blog."
  	I think the term "blog" assumes something that can be read as a complete article in one.
   There was a time when I used to write blog posts about what I learned, but I rarely do that anymore.
   Now, on rare occasions, I'll write an article that can be read independently in Scrapbox.
   	but still rare.

Option 2
	If what you intend to write down is confidential, or if writing it in a public forum would be a copyright infringement, leave it as private electronic data.
		Now, there's a private Scrapbox project, so I'll write there.

Option 3
	When it is convenient to write on paper (e.g. formulas)
 First, write on paper.
 There was a time when they kept it in that paper state.
 	I'll post a picture later.
 Now that I bought [an iPad Pro], my handwriting is basically done electronically.
 	This is automatically saved in Dropbox.
  Basically, we don't disclose it (because there are hearing memos with confidential content that we can't disclose, or dirty calculation results that we can't disclose).
  I Gyazo what I can publish as appropriate and put it on Scrapbox.

So if the question had been "except for matters that cannot & should not be made public" instead of "except for matters that must be hidden as part of my job," and the first option had been "leave as public electronic data" instead of "write on a publicly available blog," I would have chosen option 1.
