	[Motivational System].
	There was a vague sense that it would be a mistake to focus on "[motivation]."
	A little more verbalization today.
	People who are in a situation where they have fixed "things to do" and are not "motivated" to do them.
		"How do I get motivated?" implicitly affirms the fixation on "doing."
		But I'm not sure that fixation on "doing" is correct.
		Unless it's something that would kill you if you didn't do it, the thought that you "should" do it is wrong in itself.
		'I have to do it because it's my job' - implicitly ignores the option of quitting the job.
		Is it really a "must do"?
		Wouldn't it be appropriate to ignore the observed fact that "I don't feel like doing it?"
		Keep doing what you really think is [interesting].
		If it's not fun, if it's not motivating, then don't do it.
		[related to the KJ method of "interesting"].
		Need a system to collect what motivates you and what does not motivate you in order to encourage verbalization of what you find interesting
