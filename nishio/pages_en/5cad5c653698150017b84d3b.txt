I'm too good at Japanese.

Since I am good at Japanese, I can make sentences that somehow make sense even if I don't understand them.
As a result, they lose the opportunity to realize the fact that they don't "get it".

I have been trying to express sentences written in Japanese into English without using difficult vocabulary as much as possible for a little over three months.
　[The English Project for the Intellectual Production of Engineers].
　As a result, I realized
　The Japanese language we normally use uses too much difficult vocabulary.

Example
	In ["Not changing jobs does not = maintaining the status quo"], I wrote [" Whether or not you can relate to the "changing the company and yourself" part is the difference between the two."]. I wrote.
 	What is this "divide"?
 		I don't understand it well. I can't explain it in other words or simple English.
 		In other words, the meaning is not clear.

 What is [discomfort]? Can you explain this in simple words?

There is a misconception that the meaning of the verbalization is clarified when it is done.
	However, there are sentences in which a word has been placed in a sitting without clarification of meaning.
	He is too good at Japanese, i.e., he has a large number of Japanese example sentences in his brain, which allows him to choose words that sit appropriately by pattern matching.
