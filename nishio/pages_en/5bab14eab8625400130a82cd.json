Walking notes
2018-09-26
	There was some resistance to [voice input].
 I often took notes by flick typing.
 	Especially problematic when walking.
  Massage therapist points out that my neck and shoulders are stiff.
  I walk to get in better shape.
  If you're bending your neck and fiddling with your phone while you're walking, you don't know what you're exercising for.
  So, during exercise, it would be a good idea to take notes using voice input instead of flick typing.

Continue thinking about your output without feedback again
	This seems slightly more difficult.
 	We think it's important to [write and think].
 However, we are able to walk around talking a bit.
 The content may be thinner than if you think about it while looking at feedback on what you've written.
 Everything is an experiment.
 There's a little different difficulty than walking around talking to other people where you're trying not to say [filler] words.

I had some resistance to voice input, but it was great to take notes with flick input, especially when I was walking. If I bend a nail while walking, I don't know what I'm exercising for in the event that I'm walking.

Although it feels a bit like a bumpy ride to continue thinking without the gift of output, if you think about walking while talking for a moment, it's possible that you're actually doing it, but it's more of a national experiment than thinking while writing feedback rice. There is a difficulty in trying not to say peace words, which is a little different from walking around without talking to others.
