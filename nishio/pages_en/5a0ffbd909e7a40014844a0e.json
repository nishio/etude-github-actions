Parallel Work and Workerness
Consider the relationship between the Labor Standards Law's "no more than 40 hours of work per week" and parallel work.
>Article 32 An employer shall not have a worker work more than 40 hours in a week, excluding rest periods.

The definition of "worker" is already iffy, even under current law.

> The status of a driver who owns his own truck and transports goods (chartered driver) as a worker was disputed until the Supreme Court, and as a result, the status of a worker was denied.
> The status of carpenters as laborers was also disputed until the Supreme Court, where it was also denied.

>The Supreme Court recognized that the interns were engaged in medical treatment provided to patients at the time and place specified by the university hospital, in accordance with the instructions of their supervisors, and that the hospital even withheld tax at source from the money paid to the interns as scholarship money. The hospital even withheld tax at source for the money it paid to the residents as scholarships, etc. The hospital recognized the residents as workers because they provided labor under the direction and supervision of the hospital.
>In a case in which the court terminated the employment of a chorus member who had signed a basic performance contract to perform in operas throughout the year, the court held that the chorus member had the freedom to accept or reject the conclusion of individual contracts, that the time and place restraints were not labor provision under supervision because they were caused by the nature of the work of performing in operas, and that the core of the work was singing in lectures and performances, and that participation in rehearsals was merely secondary. The core of the work is the singing in the performance, and participation in rehearsals is only incidental to the work.
