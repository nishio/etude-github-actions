Elderly people without IT literacy stand in line all night at the window.
[Ibaraki City, Osaka, suspends over-the-counter reservations for vaccines, flooded with elderly people prepared to stay up all night | Mainichi Shimbun https://mainichi.jp/articles/20210510/k00/00m/040/161000c]
>The company set up a window for the elderly and others who could not use the Internet, but this resulted in long waits. Considering the health condition of the citizens, we decided to stop making reservations at the counter.
	Expect congestion → numbered tickets
	The 6th and 7th reached capacity quickly.
	Lines of people began forming after noon on the 9th to make window reservations for the week's first 10 days.
	Numbered tickets distributed ahead of schedule
		To avoid making the elderly wait all night.
		Advance distribution of numbered tickets was communicated on the website.
		By around 10:30 p.m. on the 9th, the planned 120 people had been distributed.
	Citizen who visited before dawn on the 10th: "Why are there no more numbered tickets?"

The elderly who visited before dawn on the 10th probably did not see the website of the government office. It says there that they were distributed in advance and that they have already been distributed.
Agility" may not ring a bell, but it is "making it easier to change the way you do things to suit the situation," and those who cannot keep up with the speed of that change were visualized.

When I wrote "[Those who avoid IT literacy will have to wait in long lines]" 24 days ago, I thought it would be much further along, but it occurred surprisingly quickly.
　I envisioned a situation in which the aging of the population with a declining birthrate would cause a lack of resources at the counter, but the same thing was caused by a lack of resources in the form of vaccines.
