　　When people see things, they see things from some position.
　　　Physicists from the standpoint of physics, artists from the standpoint of art.
　　Phenomenology wants to get rid of this position.

 Husserl's argument
 　Consciousness is always oriented
 　Oriented to a given object by intuition.
 　The truth is that its orientation action is enhanced
 fertile, productive field
 　He's a bit of a copyist, but you could say he's the one who revived the theory of clear evidence.
 　[Heidegger], who wrote [Sein und Zeit], was his pupil

[Theory of reproduction]
　When an object is oriented toward some object, the meaning may or may not coincide with the oriented object, and when it does, it is "true".
　　[nishio.icon]Comparing it to drawing a picture by copying a real-life chicken, for example, a picture in which four legs are drawn by mistake is "false" because it does not match reality
　　　I think "true or false" is a false dichotomy, and in reality it's a gradient with "degrees of successful replication."
　　Nishida points out that "the idea of the mimetic theory that truth is the unity of thought and the reality of the external world cannot determine the truth of thought without a correct knowledge of the reality of the external world."

　Revived by Husserl's phenomenology
　Truth is something that "compels us to think so".
　[Empirical knowledge gained from the senses is confused and unclear knowledge.
　Cannot explain accidental truths without "logical necessity that it must be so" such as historical facts.
　　Leibniz distinguished between "truth of reason" and "truth of facts" for the sake of this discussion
　　[Nishio.icon]At that time, in the 17th century, the Christian view was still strong, and they would say, "There is no such thing as coincidence, but God's will has made the choice. Therefore, it is the will of choice that underlies the truth of fact.
　　　About 100 years from here, Kant starts doing [the underage state], [Critique of Pure Reason], and so on.
