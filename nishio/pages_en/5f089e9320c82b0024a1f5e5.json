	Given a sequence of numbers, count up the contiguous subsections of the sequence whose sum is greater than or equal to K
	Sequence up to 10^5
	First, a simple one (although [cumulative sum] has been used, so it can be written in a more simple way...)
code:python
 def solve(N, K, XS):
     from itertools import accumulate
     acc = [0] + list(accumulate(XS))
     ret = 0
     for i in range(N):
         for j in range(i + 1, N + 1):
             if acc[j] - acc[i] >= K:
                 ret += 1
     return ret

And this is 10^10 in the order of squares, so change one of them to log N
ã€€[bisect]
code:python
 def solve(N, K, XS):
     import bisect
     from itertools import accumulate
     acc = [0] + list(accumulate(XS))
     ret = 0
     for i in range(N):
         lb = acc[i] + K
         j = bisect.bisect_left(acc, lb)
         ret += N + 1 - j
     return ret
