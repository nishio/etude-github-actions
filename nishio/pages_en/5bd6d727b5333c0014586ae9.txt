Always make them look at you.

	You can easily make it with [Quaternion.LookRotation].
code::
 for(int i = 0; i < slides.Count; i++)
 {
     GameObject obj = slides[i] as GameObject;
     Vector3 relativePos = obj.transform.position - camera.transform.position;
     Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(relativePos, camera.transform.up);
     obj.transform.rotation = rotation;
 }
