 *1407679799*[cat] I made a tail.
 Recently, I developed the skill of swinging catnip with my toes and thought to myself, "It's just like a mother cat playing with her kittens with her tail," but then I got a limp.
 
 So I thought, "Why not have a tail for me in the first place?" So I made one.

 Washing scissors -> rubber -> "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00IAEEB5I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B00 IAEEB5I&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Mayu-Toothpaste Long String</a>" structure. When you walk around with the clothespins around your waist, the toothpaste is dragged along with you, and the cat goes wild.
 
 It is rather important that there is an elastic in the middle. When a cat catches Jarashi, if it is a string, the energy of the cat's walking will be concentrated on the cat's claws or on the clothespin, and it will come off.
 
 Furthermore, when the cat releases its claws while the elastic is extended, the elastic shrinks and the jalousie shuffles, which seems to raise the tension as if it were an escaping prey.

 Notes. This is fine when you are moving around cleaning up or doing housework, but it does not help when you are sitting at the computer. It is useful when you occasionally stand up to go to the bathroom. However, you need to be careful not to accidentally submerge it in the toilet.
