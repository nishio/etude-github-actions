Those who have narrowed their vision around the axis of filling the valley of the axis are looked down upon.

When people have a clear value axis, they tend to prefer to focus and delve only on that.
　For example, once people recognize the value of camera resolution or communication speed, they will pursue higher resolution and higher speed.
　Often ignores whether it really leads to customer value

As a result, what is along the "axis" is created in the world first, and what is not along the "axis" is relatively delayed.

Customers are not just along the axis.
　Often, if you actually observe it, you'll find that clients are falling into the troughs of the shaft.
　There is social value in creating something B that covers the "off axis" in these situations.
　This newly created thing B is seen as "inferior" by those who are "narrow-minded on the axis".
　　'A, which was there long ago, is better than B, which is made now.'
　　This makes the implicit assumption that "[* when mapped onto axis X and compared in one dimension] the A that was there in the past is better than the B that was built now."
