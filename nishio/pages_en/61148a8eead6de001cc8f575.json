I need to organize what to say at the midterm presentation.
I was starting to feel more and more "unsure," and I wasn't even sure what I didn't understand, so I consulted Keicho.
　I was wondering if I should translate the tutorial into Japanese before the interim presentation.
　Tutorials will be made available in multiple languages after the implementation of the main functions is complete and the UI and explanations are stable, which is not now.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I don't know what to talk about in the midterm presentation anymore, so I want to talk about it and sort it out.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "midterm" is that "midterm"?
[nishio.icon]Take a 10-minute video and talk about the project you're working on.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "project" is that "project"?
[nishio.icon]A project to create digital stationery that organizes thoughts by rearranging pieces of information.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "project"?
Maybe [nishio.icon] did the first user test yesterday and then things started to get confusing.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "user test" is that "user test"?
[nishio.icon]Ask people who have never used it at all to try it and observe the process.
[nisbot.icon]What is the "process"?
[nishio.icon]Operate the tool while reading the tutorial written in English.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "tutorial" is that "tutorial"?
[nishio.icon]I made this version because the previous version was complicated and hard to explain how to start using it.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "start" is that "start"?
[nishio.icon]👍Tutorial
(This was actually pressed in the middle of writing the "start" answer, mistaking it for a predictive conversion.)

 > Read the tutorial written in English and operate the tool.
 Is there anything else about this "tutorial"?
[nishio.icon]That's the hard part. To know how to move a kozane, it must first be added, but if you don't know what it does, you won't even try to add it. I put that in order in the tutorial.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "tutorial"?
[nishio.icon] appears first when accessed.

 > That's the hard part: to know how to move a kozane, it must first be added, but if you don't know what it does, you won't even try to add it. I put that in order in the tutorial.
 How do you know this "tutorial"?
I don't know [nishio.icon] well. I somehow made it in English. Should I be able to switch to Japanese? Some people said it would be good to have an operation video.

 Where can I find this "tutorial"?
[nishio.icon]Does there have to be another content before the tutorial to motivate people to read and use the tutorial?
[nisbot.icon]What does that "tutorial" look like?
[nishio.icon]We changed what used to be a precipice into stairs, but it's not that people will climb if there are stairs, it's just that people who feel like climbing can do so more easily than on a cliff.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "precipice" is that "precipice"?
[nishio.icon]Back to the interim presentation, this is not about recruiting new people to use this tool, it's about talking about the content of the project and accelerating the future progress of the project, right?
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Maybe we are aiming for too many values at the same time. One is that the more people who use the tool and give feedback, the better the tool will be, and the more people who know about the project and give feedback, the faster the project will accelerate. They are very similar, but this is different.

 What is the relationship between these "tutorials" and "projects"?
[nishio.icon]Different. Should we make a Japanese version before the interim presentation due to negative comments about the tutorial being in English? I thought so, but this is different. The interim presentation is an introduction to the project, not a solicitation to get people to start using the tool.
[nisbot.icon]What do you hope will happen regarding that "tutorial"?
[nishio.icon]If we disregard the cost, it would be nice if it could be translated into multiple languages and switched. I was wondering if I should do that now, but it is not something that needs to be done at this point. It should be done after the implementation of the main function is completed.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen in the "tutorial" for that to happen?
The [nishio.icon]UI and what is talked about in tutorials also need to be stabilized. As we add features in the future, menus, etc. will change.
[nisbot.icon] With regard to the "tutorial", can it?
[nishio.icon]We can do it later, not now.
