(0.1.2) Benefits of reading this book
By reading this book, readers can learn intellitech, the method to boost your creativity. This is the book I would recommend for studying intellitech.

Some of the comments from reviewers include:

	I noticed what I hadn't noticed before
	I was able to translate what I was doing unconsciously into words
	The book is full of what is likely to be useful in the future, and it motivates me a lot.

These reviewers were excited because they realize their blind spots by the stimulation of this book, verbalize their experiences, and feel that they can improve further in the future.

On the other hand, there is an opposite opinion.

	It is not [ground]ed
	There is no answer to "So, what should I do?"

If there is not enough material, [connection]s do not occur. "Ground" is the set of [experience]s in their mind. If you do not feel connected, there was not enough material in your mind this time. It's okay. As the experience accumulates in you every single day, the time of connection will come some day. Please read again after half a year. Surely something changes.
