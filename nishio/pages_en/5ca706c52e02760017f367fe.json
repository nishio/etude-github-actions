Gesellschaft und Gemeinschaft
[Ferdinand Tennys] (1855-1936) said that there are two kinds of organizations, right?

	[Gemeinschaft] (German: [Gemeinschaft])
		[共同体]組織、共同体社会
		Social groups linked by human relationships such as geographical, blood, and friendship
		Members' relationships and comfort come first.
	[Gesellschaft] (German: [Gesellschaft])
		[機能体]組織、利益社会
		A social group united to achieve a common purpose or benefit
		Priority is given to achieving profits and objectives.

Although [Tennys] himself considered the changes in society as a whole during the process of [modernization], the idea of this dichotomy was so useful that it was frequently cited by subsequent [organizational theories].
Nowadays, organizations are not clearly categorized into either of these two types. Corporate organizations are usually considered gesellschafts, but investments are sometimes made in [employee satisfaction] and in creating a good working environment. [False dichotomy].

	In the classification of [Thiel Organization], Gesellschaft is an orange-type organization.
		Is the Gemeinschaft a green type?
