Slack single channel guest too difficult.

Invitee to [single channel guest on Slack
Where would you like to work from?" I was asked something along the lines of "Oh, you mean which workspace to put the guest channel in?" and chose my personal workspace at random, but it was a mistake.

>Team is currently on a free trial.
> If this is your first time using Slack, your team can start with a free 90-day trial of the Pro plan until February 18. If you wish to continue on this plan after the trial ends, you can upgrade at any time.
>... . automatically revert to the free version of Slack after February 19.
From this description, it looks like I can start a free trial of the Pro Plan here and use it until 2/19. But when I press the button, it asks me to enter my credit card information.

Hmmm, I have no idea.
Interpretation 1
 Free Trial" and "Free Version" are the same concept A, and "Free Trial of Pro Plan" is a different concept B
  Now we are in A, and for some reason we can't move to B.
  　He had once in the past b...
  　It says, "You can do one trial per workspace..."
Interpretation 2
 Free Trial" stands for "Free Trial of Pro Plan" and is the same concept A. "Free Version" is a different concept B.
 　Trial A has already started and when you press the button, the transition is to the "upgrade anytime" screen to upgrade
 　It is natural to not find the screen for initiation because it has started
 　It's unnatural that I can't find the guest channel even though it's started.
Interpretation 3
 All three are different concepts, I just haven't found the pro plan trial start page.

The overall optimal solution is to have this single channel guest in the first place, and since it's part of Cybozu's business, the channel should have been grown inside the Cybozu workspace.

I left it to sort it out after dinner, and before I knew it, it was resolved.
Does this mean that "the inviting party will not know if they are successfully connected as a single-channel guest until the inviting party adds them to the channel"?
