One Night Werewolf
	Well-honed in a [werewolf]-like game
	 PM instructions are only for one night, so by recording the instructions [no need for PM as a live person].
	 After one night of instructions, a 5-minute timer is used for discussion
  If a werewolf is among those hung by the vote, the citizen side wins.
  	All tied for first place will be hung.
   If there are multiple werewolves, the citizen side wins by hanging one of them.
  No one is eliminated from the game and becomes bored because the game ends with a single vote

	You will be playing in different roles repeatedly in a short period of time, which will help you understand

	Humans have the weakness to be quick to think irrationally.
 	A game that makes you feel it keenly.
  And it triggers that irrational thinking.
