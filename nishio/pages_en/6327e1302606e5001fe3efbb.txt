Surprisingly, there is talk of buying digital data from [C3: Computer Created Cats], so I've been trying to organize it!
ã€€The copyright of the digital data is transferred to you
ã€€ã€€You can use this data X for anything. e.g.
ã€€ã€€ Print on T-shirts and postcards
ã€€ã€€ ã€€Wear it yourself, give it to others, or sell it.
ã€€ã€€ You can create another work based on X.
ã€€ã€€  Collage, change colors, etc.
ã€€ã€€  It can be used as a material for img2img of Stable Diffusion and so on.
ã€€ã€€  Anything made in that way is your copyrighted work and you are free to sell it.
ã€€ã€€ It can be NFT.
ã€€ã€€However, you grant an unconditional license to create commentary on this image.
ã€€ã€€ã€€Specific examples [/c3cats/Cat and the Magic Lamp].
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€Thus, it is recorded and published as "made on 2022-08-26 as part of the C3 series"
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€Even after the copyright is transferred to you, we will continue to publish in the form of this page.
ã€€ã€€ã€€For example, if a future C3: Computer Created Cats book is published and sold for a fee, you grant unconditional permission to publish it.
ã€€You can put your name on your work (naming rights)
ã€€ Only names that are not offensive to public order and morals are acceptable.
ã€€We reserve the right to refuse to sell any item that you have offered to purchase.
ã€€ã€€For example, if more than one person applies for the same item, I will make the earliest one win!
ã€€ã€€Also, I'd like to avoid any derivative uses that are already in place, as that would complicate the conversation.
ã€€ã€€ã€€For example, [/c3cats/CAP-tan] will be used to explain the contents in the future
ã€€ã€€It's like picking up a cat that hasn't been noticed yet and naming it and making it famous.
ã€€ã€€ã€€A little idol audition-ish.
ã€€ã€€ã€€You might want to hit the [random button https://scrapbox.io/c3cats/Random_Button] in anticipation of a once-in-a-lifetime encounter!
