People who just read are free riders.
If the idea that those who compile information in internal [information storage] areas without any business obligation are [volunteers] and those who only read documents created by such volunteer activities but do not return anything are [free riders] becomes more widespread, the structuring of information and information design in the company will flourish more. I think this is a good idea.
