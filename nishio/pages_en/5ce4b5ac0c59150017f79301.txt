I thought this is related to the [knowledge consistency] I wrote about on p.167 of [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers].
There is no "right answer" to "what should be prioritized" when there are multiple tasks.
This is similar to the state of not knowing if "knowledge" is "correct" or not.
It is the [consistency theory of truth] ([truth theory]) that brings in the criterion that "knowledge that [combines] without contradicting more things is more trustworthy" in that state.
