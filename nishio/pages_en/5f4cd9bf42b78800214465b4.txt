Links are bidirectional
	Linking in [hypertext]" is one-way, but approaches to making links two-way emerged rather early (e.g., backlinks in wikis).
	It depends on what kind of information you put on the link, but if you put information that "Record A is related to Record B", it is natural to consider it bidirectional.
	Linkage by "common key phrase occurrence" may involve two or more records
		Unlike directed graphs, which consider edges to be ordered pairs, hypergraphs, which consider them to be sets with more than two elements, match better.
