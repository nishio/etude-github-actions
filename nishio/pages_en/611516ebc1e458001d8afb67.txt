Hope you can find a way to cut an interim presentation.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I hope you can find a way to cut an interim presentation.
[nisbot.icon]What "cut" is that "cut"?
[nishio.icon]I've written out the contents and laid them out to create a structure, but to make it into a presentation, I need to make this a one-dimensional flow from start to finish. That's what I'm lacking right now, so I need some inspiration.
[nisbot.icon]What is the "inspiration" for this "inspiration"?
[nishio.icon] Something that's like, "Okay, let's do that."
[nisbot.icon]What is that "feeling" like?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, you want certainty to move forward.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "certainty" is that "certainty"?
[nishio.icon]Just gathering and structuring information does not have a strong driving force to cut it down to one dimension.
[nisbot.icon]What "one dimension" is that "one dimension"?
The [nishio.icon] presentation is one-dimensional because it is spoken along a time axis. The structure of reality is more multidimensional, so conversion is necessary.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "one dimension"?
[nishio.icon]There is direction. Humans remember the past but not the future, so there are things that must appear first. On the other hand, humans are shifting, so you can't make it one-dimensional with that constraint alone. A structure like a math book with abstract definitions that should be known first will cause the audience to lose focus in the first half of the book.
[nisbot.icon]What "structure" is that?
[nishio.icon]In advance, the contents that are strongly related and would be told in close temporal proximity if told are arranged in close spatial proximity. The distances between kozane are not equal.

 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "structure"?
[nishio.icon]For example, as a general rule, include a demo early on to share a concrete image with the audience early on. In my last presentation, I used the title screen as a demo because I ran out of places to include a demo.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "audience" is that "audience"?
[nishio.icon]The video is more reusable if it is made with the assumption that the person is hearing the story for the first time, but there is also the option of assuming that the person has already watched the previous video. The latter condition is met in the most recent interim presentation. Wanting to make it more reusable may be complicating the issue by trying to kill two birds with one stone.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Anyway, I hope the project goes ahead. It's a waste of time worrying about what to do. You can even disregard reusability for once.
[nisbot.icon]What is its "destination"?
[nishio.icon]Saturday noon is the deadline for the video, so I want to finish my own work tomorrow, Friday. I want to leave time to support my adopted creators.

 Where is this "structure"?
[nishio.icon]Not yet, if you find a starting point, you can take it from there.
[nisbot.icon]What is the "starting point" for this "starting point"?
[nishio.icon]Starting and Landing Points
[nisbot.icon]What "landing spot" is that "landing spot"?
[nishio.icon]Well, in terms of how to end the presentation, given the nature of the meeting, it is appropriate to end with me talking about what I am struggling with at the moment and throwing open questions to the audience.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "troubled" is that "troubled"?
[nishio.icon]I've been wondering how to collect feedback until recently, but I just realized that crowdsourcing is the way to go. I'm not too worried, there are a lot of features in the previous version that are not implemented yet, and I don't have time to implement them. Not enough time to implement them.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "distress" is that "distress"?
[nishio.icon]My biggest concern is what form the announcement should take.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "announcement" is that?
[nishio.icon]A 10-minute video sharing the current status of the project
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "project" is that "project"?
[nishio.icon]Project to create digital stationery to organize thoughts
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "project"?
[nishio.icon]Well, for me personally, the last project has achieved a quality that can replace what I used to do with paper stickies, so the next step is to verify whether other people can use it and create value.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "project" located?
[nishio.icon]So you need to let them "nest" from being in my hands alone.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Well, for me personally, the last project has achieved a quality that can replace what I used to do with paper stickies, so the next step is to verify whether it will create value when others use it.
 What does this "project" look like?
[nishio.icon]They are like bird chicks, you can't keep them locked in a cage forever, you have to release them when they are ready to fly.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "basket" is that "basket"?
[nishio.icon]The creator's sole discretion
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "maker" is that "maker"?
[nishio.icon]Well, it's me, but the bottom line is that I created this tool to allow me to do what I'm used to doing electronically, so it only supports my usage.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "I" is that "I"?
[nishio.icon]I myself need to learn new ways of doing things, but if I use a tool that is not scalable, I am bound to what is possible with that tool. I become a caged bird myself.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "basket"?
[nishio.icon]We need to break this cage more and more.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "basket"?
[nishio.icon]In the heart
[nisbot.icon]
 > Well, for me personally, the last project has achieved a quality that can replace what I used to do with paper stickies, so the next step is to verify whether it will create value when others use it.
 How do you know about this "project"?
[nishio.icon]Driving in the direction of increased uncertainty and seeing unexpected developments occur.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "uncertainty" is that "uncertainty"?
[nishio.icon] For example, extensibility by the user.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "extensibility" is that "extensibility"?
[nishio.icon] Users can add menus, and JavaScript can describe what to do with the menus.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "user" is that "user"?
[nishio.icon]People other than me. You can add and use any functions you want without my help. I can also experiment with new features without hard-coding.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that "me"?
[nishio.icon] I myself had difficulty adding features in previous versions.
[nisbot.icon]What "version" is that "version"?
[nishio.icon]Regroup.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Yes, it is appropriate to end with an open question to the audience about how to end the presentation, and given the nature of the meeting, what I am struggling with at the moment.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "troubled" situation?
[nishio.icon]In that sense, it would be good if you could tell us what features users would like to see added, since we don't know at this point what features they would like to see added. It's a relatively easy question to answer.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "user"?
[nishio.icon]Nothing special. I've seen where we landed, now it's time to start.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "landing spot"?
[nishio.icon]No.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Yes, it is appropriate to end with an open question to the audience about how to end the presentation, and given the nature of the meeting, what I am struggling with at the moment.
 Where does this "troubled" come from?
[nishio.icon]Unknown to me
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its "me"?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm... maybe we know after the fact through interacting with others.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Well, for me personally, the last project has achieved a quality that can replace what I used to do with paper stickies, so the next step is to verify whether it will create value when others use it.
 Where is this "project" located?
[nishio.icon]I don't see any indication that we're going to talk about a starting point, but I guess I'll just start with the same demo as before...
[nisbot.icon]What "last time" is that "last time"?
[nishio.icon]Boost Conference
[nisbot.icon]
 > Yes, it is appropriate to end with an open question to the audience about how to end the presentation, and given the nature of the meeting, what I am struggling with at the moment.
 Where is this "distressed"?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘Ž I'm having trouble.

 Where is this "structure" located?
[nishio.icon]Once the starting point and the landing point are determined, the rest can be traced, and while tracing it, it can change.
[nisbot.icon]Where does that "landing spot" come from?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘ŽLanding point
[nisbot.icon]What "starting point" is that "starting point"?
[nishio.icon]I will do a demo.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "demo" is that "demo"?
[nishio.icon]Show them what it's like to actually see what you've created in action.
[nisbot.icon]What "place" is that "place"?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘Ž and place
[nisbot.icon]
 > My biggest concern is what form the announcement should take.
 Is there anything else about this "announcement"?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, nothing in particular.
[nisbot.icon]

 What do you hope will happen regarding this "structure"?
