Civilians attack civilians with a sense of justice.

 I thought it was the trend of civilization for global companies to become more powerful than specific nations, but I was surprised that global companies do not sanction the actions of specific nations. Unlike nations, global companies are loosely connected to land, so when there is a business obstacle in a particular land, they simply rearrange their business to avoid the obstacle, rather than fighting. They don't fight because they have different layers of strength.
