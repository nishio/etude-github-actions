howm's come-from link
In [howm], the notation ">>> aaa" is a link to aaa.
	This link is goto link
		The link is realized by "search and list by that keyword" as an implementation.

If you write "<<<< aaa", all occurrences of the keyword in all sentences will be links to it.
	This is the come-from link
	How to declare, "If a link for this keyword is pressed on another page, it will come here."
 　[Calling Link]
 　Opposite to "goto" which is "go where you are going".
　This is useful for use cases like definitions in mathematics where you want to be able to "easily navigate from where this concept is mentioned elsewhere to here": [come-from links and mathematics].
　A case study that I knew we needed a come-from link.
　　At the end of the page, I wrote "[expanded hit decision]", in order for the first-time reader to know what this means, it should be a link to the explanation page[.
　　However, if we make each of these links that appear on various pages, the current Scrapbox specification will cause a [2-hop link] between those pages.
　　　If you want to avoid that with the current spec, you need the bad know-how of using icon notation and external links.

code::
 = <<< goto link
	
 In howm, you can use the "howm" function to show the relationship between memos, files, etc., and to move them around.
 Two types of links are used for First, the most basic goto link
 This section describes the following
	
 A goto link, for a simple example, is an html <a href="..." ><a href="..." ></a>
 The goto link is used as follows
	
 > 
 >>> Testing
 > 
	
 The goto link is actually implemented using the search mode. For example, the above
 Press `RET' on the link,
	
     M-x howm-list-grep
     Search all (grep): test
	
 the same thing happens as if you had used howm's search mode.
	
	
 Also,
	
 > 
 > >>> /etc/services
 > 
	
 If you specify a file that actually exists as a goto link, such as
 Press `RET' to search, and `RET' again to open the file.
 The link can be created in the same way as a link to a website.
	
 Apart from this, URLs beginning with file:// or http:// are also treated as links.
 If you press `RET' on a link, the file scheme will be defined in Emacs itself, using the http ski
 The browse-url-browser-function can be used to directly open the browse-url-browser.
	
 In the file scheme, `C-u RET' will split the window and open it.
	
	
 = <<< come-from link
	
 Next, let's look at a slightly different kind of come-from link: come-from
 Links automatically link to all words in other memos. For example
	
 > 
 > <<< apple
 > A delicious red fruit. In Japan, Aomori is famous for its production.
 > 
	
 and write it in other notes.
	
 > 
 > I love apples.
 > 
	
 the "apple" part will be underlined, whereupon you press `RET'.
 The system will automatically jump to a memo with a description of the apples.
	
 It is a little quirky to use compared to goto links, but it is very useful, so learn to use it!
 Let's leave it at that.
