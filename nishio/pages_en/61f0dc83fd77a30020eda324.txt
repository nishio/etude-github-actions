(6.2.6) Summary of verbalization
In this section, as a part of the method of [gathering information], we explained with emphasis on how to retrieve information that already exists among you and others. *39
Finally, let's review.

I collected the mention about the [iceberg model].

[Overall picture of the iceberg model]

It is important to pay attention to what have not been words yet.
For example, body sensation, experience and discomfort. 
When trying to make words, it often happens to be in the form of a parable or a metaphor.
The words that just came out may not be conveyed to people without explanation.
But you do not have to be afraid of. 
It is good to take your thought out of yourself first, write it down and keep it from disappearing, and then improve it to a form that is conveyed to other people.
Even if it is written in a language only to you, the words work as handles, and those make you easier to operate your thought.

On the other hand, as in the example of "[voice of birds]", it is also common that the the handle is disconnected from a concrete experience. In that case, you need to go down to a physical sensation or an experience and reconnect it with the [handle]. The purpose here is to connect "what is not verbalized yet inside of you" and "the handle as words". 
Making words without the connection is useless. It is like a [rootless grass]. It will die soon.

*39:
I have chosen "[verbalization]" as a relatively easy to understand word. However, there are many ways of extracting information, not limited to language, such as the arrangement of cards, pictures, and gestures. By using [Ikujiro Nonaka]'s term, "[externalization]" is more appropriate.
