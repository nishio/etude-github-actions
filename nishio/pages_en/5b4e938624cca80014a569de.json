BMOT Special Class No. 3 "Intellectual Production
 2018-08-22 Schedule
 [application page https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlzLCPsUL6F32B7okGgHKK05PjraApvgSoReVOQ3voLDVPAw/viewform]
 Continuing with the theme of "Intellectual Production," a type of physical education class where the instructor does not teach one-way but rather the audience engages in discussion.
  Physical education type class = only the instructor can't be physically active in a physical education class.
  Similarly, there is no such thing as a one-way lecture in an intellectual production class, where the lecturer speaks one-sidedly from lecture slides that have been intellectually produced in advance.
  [class is physical education]

	Review of previous survey results
 >It might have been better to use the chat system together and have participants write freely, allowing discussion among participants while Dr. Nishio picks up salient comments from them. Dr. Nishio's notes are good for picking up key words, so it would be good to use them together. Since some people may not have a device to view the chat, the content of the chat should be displayed on the screen, and hand-raising questions should also be used in conjunction.
 [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon] Next time, would you like to make a Twitter hashtag and try something like the above?
 [nishio.icon]I'd like to try and see all kinds of things, but that venue is so long horizontally that I'm having a hard time figuring out how to get the chat out!
 [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]I think there would be a little too much information if Nishio's notes and Twitter timeline were available.
 [nishio.icon]The ability for participants to discuss with each other via chat is actually a useful method that some conferences have adopted. When I had a regular class, I planned to introduce it. The tool was initially IRC, and now it is Slack.
 [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]slack is convenient and I want to use it, but it looks like about 30 minutes will pass just to give a lecture to the participants on how to use it.
  We expect about 20% of the participants to have experience using slack.
  The two advantages of Twitter are "probably its high penetration rate" and "the ease of spreading the word to the public that you are giving a special lecture".
 [nishio.icon] Twitter is not for discussion.
  If communication among participants is important, chat tools are the way to go.
  If you are not comfortable with Slack, you can use Facebook Messenger.
  If external publicity is important, Twitter can be used.
 [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]I'm thinking that slack would be best if it is available, and I'd like to be able to introduce it smoothly so that participants can use it, do you have any ideas?
 I feel like I can't imagine that there are obstacles to implementing [nishio.icon]slack. We don't use any advanced features, it's just chat.
 [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]If you've never used slack before, just setting up an account, logging in, and so on, will probably take at least 20 minutes.
 [nishio.icon]Oh, I see, you don't have an account...
  I'm feeling as surprised as if you just told me "some people don't have e-mail addresses", but I guess that's true...
  It's just a chat, so it doesn't have to be Slack at all, so Facebook is fine.
 [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]I think one solution would be to create a group on Facebook for participants on the day of the event and chat within that group.
 [nishio.icon]That's a technique that unexplored events have been using for years!

		It was six years ago. By the way, this is a page I wrote thinking about how to do publicity for a programming symposium
  I used to use IRC, but it was a hassle to set up the server, and the announcement cost increased as the ratio of participants who don't understand IRC increased.
   [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]That's why I'm worried about slack this time.
  The Programming Symposium then returned to IRC before becoming Slack last year.
  Unexplored private events have this operation in a private group.
 [nishio.icon]By the way, next time we will try APISNOTE, which was taught to us by a participant of the first meeting. I can still provide the function that participants can write freely in this.
  [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]Sounds interesting, I'll try it myself later and share my thoughts.
   It could be a very good learning experience for participants to be involved in Nishio's notes.
 [nishio.icon]I just realized that most participants don't have a wifi connection in the first place.
  [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]Indeed, there is no wifi connection, so you have to be able to use it from your phone to participate!
 [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]Points that stumbled in the introduction of APISNOTE.
  There is a button for FB login, but I couldn't log in on FB.
  I logged in with a google account, but people without a google or evernote account stumble upon it.
  The operation is not intuitive.
  You learn a little bit more as you go along, but it's still difficult.

   I tried to touch it with reference to the above page, but it took me about 15 minutes before I was able to use the minimum functions.
   Considering the large number of people using the footprint, it would take almost 30 minutes.
  I have the impression that a small group of less than 10 people could just about do it, but more than that would be difficult.
  There's also the problem of no wifi connection. I tried to control it from my phone, but the phone UI is so broken that I don't feel like I can use it.
 [nishio.icon]Trying to write out and structure at the same time may be too much of a cognitive burden.
  How about Scrapbox?
  I can do it on my phone.
  Create a Scrapbox project with write permission for everyone.

  Announce that it is to be used in an unstructured, chatty manner.
   If Mr. Tachikawa writes in a sakura while actually displaying the page at the beginning of class, he can see how it looks to other people when he writes.
		Keep it as a QR code.

	Next time or now, you could ask if they have Google (Scrapbox), Slack, Facebook, and Twitter accounts.


 More time for reflection, so even if you didn't attend the first session, it's okay!
  First, from the results of the questionnaire for the first class and the second [discussion with Toshitaka Tan].
   answer a question
   Here are some interesting ones
  Then the audience was asked, "What was interesting between the last time and the conversation?"

 What Shiozawa Sensei did in his first class
  What is the Civil Code for?"
  Think for yourself for 5 minutes and write it on the paper at hand.
  Then exchange opinions with buddies
  What is a buddy?
   duo
   form a partnership with someone nearby
   If you don't have a partner, just raise your hand and the teacher will match you.

 Plan to experiment with APISNOTE to try it out.
  KJ method is useful for organizing after a lot of information like last time
  But it's hard to share the KJ process.
   Insufficient resolution [KJ method and resolution].
  I received a suggestion at a reception to use APISNOTE.

  But it's not positioned as the main content of this episode.
  A meeting to introduce APISNOTE, a meeting to learn APISNOTE, not a meeting to learn APISNOTE.
  What kind of tools should be available for intellectual production in today's world? What kind of tools should be available for intellectual production in today's age?

  Minimum Rules
   write freely
   move freely
   No pulling each other out.

>It seemed like the same people were always speaking. How about a short question and answer format, one question per person, etc.? Please consider it.

>Why did Dr. Nishio become a specified associate professor?
 It looked interesting!
 Interesting" = "Because I think I'll learn more if I do it than if I don't."

>Which of the various intelligent labor and productivity and which cannot be replaced by AI?

>It would be interesting to do a practical version of the KJ method in the form of a workshop.
 It takes quite a bit of time...

>It was very inspiring that the lecture went so fast that I thought I was going to get wisdom fever. It may not be for the general public, but I thought this kind of thing was possible. Thank you very much, Dr. Nishio and coordinator Mr. Tachikawa.
 More slowly...

>I would like to tell you that it is worthwhile to participate in this class because there is a high possibility that you will encounter something that you did not know.

>I was interested in MOT, but I thought it would be better to have an opportunity to learn about MOT with people involved in product development (RD, BD, QC, design, IR, sales, etc.) rather than with people who want to learn about MOT, so that I could be exposed to diverse ideas.

>The idea of pursuing simplicity and low-consciousness fintech is interesting.

>I would like to tell them that spinning is also an important quality of an entrepreneur!

>This participatory style of dialogue is a great way to train those who participate, so I hope you will continue it and I will try to participate more myself.

>It was like an informal BMOT meeting. I didn't really like Mr. Tan's loose feeling. I guess he has that kind of character, but his speech was not crisp and it was hard to listen to. The content of what he was talking about was also not very informative. Also, the meeting itself, as mentioned above, felt uncomfortable because of the BMOT's internal atmosphere. I think it would be better to have a little more tension in the meeting since there were people from outside. I think it would be better to have a more tense meeting.

>It was amazing to be shown what kind of people are thinking about starting a business, even if it's just one example.

>I like BMOT's homey feel.

>It's great that young people are exploring and starting businesses without fear of failure, but I wish the discussion in the dialogue was a bit more lively.
