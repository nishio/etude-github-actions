Discord Katakana Tsu Incident
Incident in which the katakana character "ts" was changed to a character form between "shi" and "ts".
　2022-12-03 Corrected.
　Emoticons ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ for appearance in the (interpretation)
　Made by a designer who does not understand that there are "ts" and "shi" in Japanese (interpretation).

>Currently, gg sans breaks Japanese sentences' visual.
>Could you revert the design of this?
>tbh, I'm sad cuz my mother tongue's characters are consumed as just symbols
