	Tools that make it easy to do amazing things
	Tutorials are being made.
	Does it work in a browser and output an exe?
		Code created in blocks is converted to python and js.
		I wonder if they make an exe from Python, or if they bundle the JS and it's electron-like.

  >What I like about CodeMao
   >Able to resize the screen.

	I also made a game when I got home https://ide.code.game/we/8984

		Scene management is attached to the original.
			Once I made the game, I wanted to add a title screen later.
				I couldn't figure out how to add a scene to the foreground after the fact.
				I couldn't even figure out how to set the initial display scene.
				So I created a title screen after the game scene and tried to copy and paste the contents of the game screen into the scene behind it.
				Error message that the function name is duplicated even though the original function has been deleted, and reloading the IDE does not cure the problem.
				Even if you change the function name, the function call block cannot freely edit the name of the function to be called, so you have to recreate the whole function.
