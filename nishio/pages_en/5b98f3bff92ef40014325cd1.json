	[The Adventures of the Philosophy of Science: Exploring the Purpose and Methods of Science
	[戸田山 和久]
	[Amazon https://amzn.to/2N6abV7]

	It was written in an easy to follow manner from the basics of the philosophy of science.
 Most memorable was the introduction of the idea that "the truth of science is a [social construct].
 	The author's position is against it.
 It was an opportunity for me to think about "[truth]" that until then I had vaguely assumed to be self-evident.

	After this, I read [Introduction to Philosophy] by [Ikujiro Nishida].
