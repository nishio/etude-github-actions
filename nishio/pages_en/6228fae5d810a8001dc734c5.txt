When something is disappointing, it's your fault.
When you [expect] something, but it's not what you expected, it's not that that's bad, it's you with your "false expectations".

It's not that it's [disappointing], it's that I'm [disappointing].

To blurt out that something was a disappointment is to double down on the shame of having had false expectations and now attributing that error to others instead of to yourself.
