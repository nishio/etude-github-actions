20180726 What we did
	[Highlight multiple slides].
 	I'm using one "red board" right now to achieve the highlighting, but should I make one for each slide or is there a better way...
		I got as far as creating the object with the red border and adding it to the child objects.
  No way to access the child from the object
  Should there be a MonoBehavior to represent slides because I want to store children, indexes, file names, etc.?
		→Created a non-MonoBehaviour class to represent slides.
			[Refactoring 20180726].

 Time measurement of multiple selections
 	Check if it is safe to do every frame
  Let's display FPS using [Status Display on Controller]!
		→ I made one that gives out the FPS in Debug.Log.
  	I prefer the controller status display because the logs drift away.
