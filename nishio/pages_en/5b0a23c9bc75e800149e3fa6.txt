People's interest in the system
 Something doesn't feel right, so I'm trying to verbalize it.
 There's a difference between being interested in people's systems and being interested in people.
 Poor ability to identify people
 I happened to observe a case study of connecting people to create a beneficial community up close.
 I don't understand what they are thinking and doing at all.
 But I sensed there was some logic to it, so I tried to verbalize it through observation.
 I could verbalize it to some extent.
 Once you feel like you understand it, try to implement it and verify that you understand it correctly.
 Not only are they not interested in individual people, they may inadvertently not even be interested in individual communities.
 I'm more interested in how each community is working and what problems they are solving.
