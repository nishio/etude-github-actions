 The more people, the higher the cost, but there is an advantage to having more than one person: "A strong incentive to verbalize the unverbalized is generated.
 I don't know of any advantage to being more than three people.
 So it would be good to focus on the "two-person" method instead of trying to do it with a large number of people at once.

 There are two ways of doing things, one in which the partner can be educated on how to do it beforehand, and the other in which he or she cannot, and the latter can be used in more situations.

 The idea that techniques that encourage others to verbalize, such as [clean language], may be beneficial.

Different context, but quite relevant.
