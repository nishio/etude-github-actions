 Move slide to another [infosphere
 I'd have preferred to have fewer slides to move already in demonstrating the operation.
 In the infosphere after moving, the slides you release move away from each other, and the physics between slides are subtle, which is a bug.
 	The core of the infosphere interferes with the physics, exerting a repulsive force on all the slides and pushing them to their limits where the physics stops after a certain distance from the camera.
