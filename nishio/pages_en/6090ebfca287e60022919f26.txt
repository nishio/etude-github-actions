 *1233114774*One reason to use Python 2.6
 In 2.6, however, it is now possible to pass a timeout as an argument to the socket library. This is done after the socket connection has been made. This is useful because the socket will be disconnected after a specified number of seconds, even if the connection has already taken a long time. I thought that if we had the most advanced BOTs placed on an appropriate server, and if we could make it so that we could send requests via HTTP, third-party BOTs would be happy to be able to play against humans. If the BOT author can set the timeout, the user can say, "Oh, this BOT returns results within 5 seconds, and this BOT returns results within 60 seconds. I want to play slowly against a strong opponent, so I'll go for the 60-second timeout" and choose whatever they want.

 *1233161373* Talk about cheap DVDs on Amazon.co.uk
 Summary: DVDs can be found on Amazon.co.uk at prices 8 times lower than in Japan, and the region code for DVDs is the same as in Japan. The playback format is PAL, so it cannot be played on players that do not support PAL, but it can be played on PCs without any problem. I actually purchased two DVDs of Ghost in the Shell for 890 yen including shipping, and confirmed that I could watch them on my MacBook without any problem. Since many people seem to be bothered by the yen conversion, I created a summary site called <a href='http://ikunozama.appspot.com/'>Ikunozama</a>. You can see a list of items registered by others, including their yen-converted prices and whether or not they contain Japanese characters. <a href='http://ikunozama.appspot.com/price_range/2000/to/4000/'>View by price range</a>.

 This is the DVD-box that contains the famous "Â SPAM SPAM SPAM~" video that caused spam to be called SPAM. 22 pounds, so 2800 yen. This price is for 8 discs. In Japan, one DVD costs 3300 yen.
 
 Well, I borrowed Flying Circus from ymasuda and watched it, so for me, it has a lot of stuff in it, including "Ni!"<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000W8AB22?ie=UTF8&tag=nh06-21 &linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000W8AB22">Monty Python: The Monster Box Set (The Definitive, Outrageously Luxurious Special Edition Collection)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=nh06-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B000W8AB22" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />I'm wondering if I should buy Monty Python's Flying Circus, And Now for Something Completely Different, Life of Brian, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and The Meaning of Life for 7100 yen.
 
 
 I have some information that the region code in the UK is the same as Japan's, and the playback system is PAL, but there is no problem at all (<a href='http://blog.livedoor.jp/yosoys/archives/51014878.html'>Clan Colla Blog (Irish Music Forest): PAL DVD playback</a>). PAL DVD playback</a>), but I'm still a little nervous, so I decided to try DMM's mail-in rental service (480 yen), which I had mentioned the other day. ZEK?ie=UTF8&tag=nh06-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000RF9ZEK">Ghost in the Shell - Solid State Society</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=nh06-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B000RF9ZEK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none ! important; margin:0px ! That's 4 pounds, or 510 yen. If you actually put it in the cart and specify Japan as the destination, the price drops to 3.5 pounds because it is no longer subject to UK sales tax. The postage costs about 3.5 pounds, for a total of 7 pounds, or 890 yen. That's cheap!
 
 
 Unfortunately, even though the MacBook Pro is eye-poppingly inexpensive, Japan is not included in the mailing range. Software cannot be shipped to Japan either. Books, music, and DVDs are fine.

 Considering that the strong yen and weak pound have made it even cheaper, but still only twice as cheap at best, and that it is also cheaper in the U.S., I think it is more correct to interpret this as "DVDs are sold for 4 to 8 times the usual rip-off price on the islands at the eastern end of the country!" I thought it was more correct to interpret it as "DVDs are sold for 4 to 8 times the usual rip-off price on the islands at the eastern end of Japan!

 PS: The Ghost in the Shell DVD I ordered on January 28 arrived on February 4. As it turns out, it was in the mailbox as usual, and when I put it in my MacBook, I was able to watch it without any trouble at all.
