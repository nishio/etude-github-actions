Scrapbox is a flow-type wiki
>Scrapbox could be classified as a Wiki, but it's a flow type, not a stock type (if anything)

While [nishio.icon] does not agree with this opinion, I think it is an important angle.

	The argument of stock versus flow is [a false dichotomy].
		[Flow/stock is a false dichotomy].
	Some people use the Wiki-like service only for stocking purposes.
		I would write a page with neatly arranged, sectional headings.
		And the effort to clean up the page is exhausting.
		as a result
			I know I have to write the documentation, but it's tedious..."
			'I read it because I thought it was correct because of the nicely arranged documentation, but it was actually outdated information! Why aren't they maintaining it!"
			this tragedy takes place
		In wikis that allow hierarchical organization, unless you explicitly create a "place where you can put anything", the process tends to be "first create the page in the right place".
	The problem stems from using it as a "warehouse of [dead text]," to use [Scrapbox's philosophy] phrase.
	Scrapbox allows chat-like [real-time communication
		The term "[chatty]" is a misnomer.
			Chats line up information in one dimension.
			Scrapbox is arranged in a tree-like structure.
		Achieved through strong collaborative editing capabilities.
			It can be said to be a [tree board] that can be edited collaboratively in real time.
		This allows for "flow-like" use, such as chatting, and the logs are stocked.
	Using a wiki as a means of communication is nothing new.
		The concept of [ThreadMode] in Cunningham's C2Wiki, which created the Wiki
			see [Wiki mode].
			　I don't know when it first appeared, but at least it was used without explanation in a presentation at a symposium on wikis in 2005
				　https://www.opensym.org/ws2005/proceedings/paper-09.pdf
				The term ThreadMode is also used in "Wiki Writing: Collaborative Learning in the College Classroom" (2008)
			Discussion in a thread with a notation, then moving on to an unnamed commentary.
		The misfortune is that in the process of popularizing wikis, more and more people are using them as a mere CMS.
			I forgot to use it as a means of communication.
