 *1374462891* Interviewed about "Recommended Graphs" (with supplementary slides)
 We recently received an article about the&#8232;recommended graphs' in our product kintone.
 
 <a href='http://enterprisezine.jp/dbonline/detail/4978'>The "Scientist" Behind Kintone's "Recommended Graph Function" (1/3): Information Site Connecting Enterprise IT, Management and Business EnterpriseZine (EZ)</a>
 
 However, it seems that the scientist talk did not go over as well as we had hoped. So I made supplementary slides.
