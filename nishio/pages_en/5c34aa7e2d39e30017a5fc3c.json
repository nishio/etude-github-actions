Twitter-like review tool
	It would be nice to have a [Twitter]-like UI, where the data I pour into it flows through my timeline, I can like it, once I've seen it, it doesn't come up for a while, I can see as much content as I want with one thumb, I can see what I liked or replied to later, it's easy to [one-person brainstorm], and later on, I can summarize it in Scrapbox. It would be nice to have one that is easy to compile in Scrapbox.
	As for the data to be streamed in, I initially imagined something like "extracted parts of a book that have been read and highlighted," but it may be possible to include the entire book in the first place. The sentences are lined up in a timeline, [fragmented] to an appropriate length, and can be read with a single thumb, and can be liked and commented on. You can stop whenever the train arrives at the station, and the next time you open the timeline, the next time you open it, it will be lined up from the beginning.
		I can strongly promote [Incremental Reading].
		You can "like" something on the train or in an elevator in a small window of time, and then later reprint it to Scrapbox on your PC.
