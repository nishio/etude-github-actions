	The idea was that existing firms would be replaced by new entrants with better technology, and older firms that were no longer able to learn new things would be eradicated
 	[S-shaped development of technology] [Foster1986].
		technology trajectories [Dosi1982]
  punctuated equibria [Tushman&Anderson1986]
 However, it was shown that there are cases of market capture by products with inferior performance
 	disruptive technology [Christensen1997] # disruptive innovation
	The phenomenon of disruptive technology is well known, but the mechanisms behind it are not yet clear.
 This paper focuses on the structure of demand
 	preference overlap
  preference symmetry
 Shows a formal model so you can see what happens under different experimental conditions
 Computer simulation

	Tend to focus on supply-side interactions when discussing technology competition
 	Saturation of conventional technology [Foster1986] [Utterback&Abernathy1975].
  Avoid cannibalizing existing products [Kamien&Schwartz1982].
		Organizational inertia [Hannan&Freeman1977] [Tushman&Romanelli1985].
		Lack of ability to acquire new technologies [Henderson&Clerk1990] [Leonard-Barton1992].
	But even without assuming those situations, technological transitions occur.
 	Existing technology has no limits [Christensen1992] etc.
  New technology does not necessarily produce higher performance [Christensen1997] etc.
  Existing firms are not incapable of learning new technologies [Bower& Christensen1995].
	Suggests that something is being overlooked.
