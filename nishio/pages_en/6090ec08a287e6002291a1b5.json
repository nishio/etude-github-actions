 *1316134422*Society in "Models"-Invitation to Mathematical Sociology Leverage Memo
 The other day, I was writing a manuscript for "Information Processing," the journal of the Information Processing Society of Japan, and while my wife was checking my manuscript, she suggested a few books that she thought would be interesting to read. She introduced me to several books. One of them was "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4326601655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& <a href=" creative=7399&creativeASIN=4326601655">Society in Models: An Invitation to Mathematical Sociology</a>".
 
 This is a story that uses mathematical models to explain 44 "phenomena" in about 4 pages each, and it's an easygoing book that you can read from anywhere. It's quite interesting. Maybe people who would be interested in the title of this entry have heard of the "Prisoner's Dilemma" or "Small World," but the book introduces a lot of keywords, including those. The great thing is that each entry is accompanied by a bibliography, so if you want to know more, you can read the paper or dig deeper as needed. It is useful as an index to various studies.
 
 My argument in my own writing was that it is important to have not only connections within a close-knit community but also sparse connections across communities in order to connect knowledge from different fields and create interesting things, but in the book "Why Wide and Shallow Connections Are More Advantageous for Changing Jobs," Granovetter's "weak ties" theory, as explained in the book, turned out to be quite a hit with what I had vaguely thought.
 
 A quick pickup of key words in this book: decision theory, expected utility theory, game theory, network analysis, social choice theory, Becker's dependency model, St. Petersburg paradox, Ale's counterexample, prospect theory, Akalov's used car market model, reverse selection, Durkheim's suicide theory, the game model of trust, the non-cooperative game model, the prisoner's dilemma, Axelrod's shippe strategy, the differential equation model of bilateral relationships, the imbalance in relationships, the cheap talk game, Becker's human capital model to explain the benefits of marriage, the algebraic structure of the exchange of women (in the context of incest's in the context of incest bans), Easterlin's model of why children do not increase, Signeau's intergenerational dependency model, threshold model to explain booms, Olson's model of collective action, Iannacon's model of religion, why hierarchies form even in democratic organizations, Bonacich's centrality index, small world model, weak ties, tragedy of the commons, threshold model of susceptibility, failure of public authority to resolve, model of self-organized collective choice, self-fulfilling model of prophecy, cellular automata model, Simon's model of group cohesion, FK model of hierarchy image, relative deprivation theory, Sen's wealth, utility, function relation, Spence Spence's signaling model (why famous universities are good at getting jobs), Bourdon's model of educational opportunity (inequality), the paradox of liberalism, the paradox of voting, agenda control, Nash's bargaining model, Richardson's arms race model...Whew, I thought I would just excerpt some key words. I was going to write down just a few key words, but that would be too much to write...
