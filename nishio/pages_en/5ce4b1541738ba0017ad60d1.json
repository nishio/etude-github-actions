Scrapbox page refactor
	A page X is pinned to the top
	I wrote a lot of things down there.
	The result was a very large quantity.
	You're going to lose perspective.
	I want to solve this problem.
	I want to preserve it first.
		案1
			duplicate pageでXのコピーを作る(X2と呼ぶ)
			X2 has unfortunately lost all the data on the update date and time, etc.
			So I want to preserve the X's as original data.
 	Rename X to "X(-20190522)", etc.
 		It asks if you want to auto-update the link, but ignore it.
 	unpin someone
	Create a new X page
		Link to "X(-20190522)"
		Now we have "split logs" for now.
		If you keep writing on a new page, the log will be "divided by date of creation".
	refactor
		At the beginning of the old page there was a line link to the middle of the page
		This is "frequently accessed but buried halfway down the page and unwieldy"
		[line link is an opportunity to cut out].
		Oh, the row links are broken by the above refactoring
		Links to a page as a concept can be switched above, but line links are linked to a part of the page, so if the content of the page is rewritten, they will not be connected.
