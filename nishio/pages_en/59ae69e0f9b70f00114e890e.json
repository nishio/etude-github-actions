Analogy and Innovation
"[Developing Innovations Based on Analogies]: Experience from Design and Engineering Consultants"

The use of analogies in the product design process

[Analogous information transfer can be categorized along two axes
(1) Conceptual distance between source and target domains
(2) Content of communication

	The use of analogies is a common phenomenon in design and engineering consulting firms
 	Twelve of the 16 interviewees "frequently use analogies."
  3 out of 16 did not use analogy and 1 is rare
  18 analogies

 Similarity distance is positively associated with solution novelty and negatively associated with project duration
 Distant rather than close analogies facilitate communication within the project team and between the project team and the client company
 With regard to the content of the transfer, a beneficial effect on the project duration occurs especially when the problem solver transfers existing technical solutions or specific functional principles, rather than general knowledge of geometry or design mechanics
