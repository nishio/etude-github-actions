cannot compile namespaces when the '--isolatedModules' flag is provided
	[React] [TypeScript]
	Automatic '--isolatedModules' flag when [create-react-app
	I get this error when I create a new ts file.
	This is because this file does not export anything.
		Not appropriate as a module, just namespaces
		Error messages are difficult to understand

approach
code:typescript
 let Foo;
 export default Foo;
If you write something like "I'm not sure if this is a module or not," it will take the appropriate form as a module for the time being.
Replace it later when the correct "what should be exported" is available.
