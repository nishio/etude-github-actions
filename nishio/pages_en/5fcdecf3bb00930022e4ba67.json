Lower fixed binomial coefficient → overlapping combination
[$ \binom{A+i}{A} = \binom{A+i}{i} = H^{A+1}_i]

[$ \binom{A+i}{A} = H_A^{i+1} ]
The latter is also possible, but the former seems to be a more natural form of [folding overlapping combinations] since it places a variable ball on a fixed frame.

[lower fixed binomial coefficient]→[overlapping combination].
