 **1214125919*Siteusan T-shirt
 It's T-shirt season...I need to make a Jython T-shirt!
 
 I bought a "Saitousan T-shirt" made by id:gomi-box. : http://hina.sophis.info/character/saito/t/t_2008.php
 
 *1214129731*Regional 1000Speakers
 Watching Kakutani-san's Regional RubyKaigi talk at RubyKaigi, I was thinking that all of them have the same problem.
 
 In fact, the 1000 Speakers Conference has also set up a mailing list to quietly discuss regional conferences, but only a very small number of members are on it because we thought it would be difficult to invite everyone who responded to "<a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20080526/ 1211752283">About the 6th 1000 Speakers Conference</a>".
 
 However, when I hear these kinds of talks, I feel a trend toward "a world where conferences are held by various people here and there (not only in Tokyo). If that is the case, it might be a good idea to have a "place for people who are running conferences or thinking about running conferences to discuss them" without limiting it to 1,000 speaker conferences. A mailing list or something.
 
 *1214132228*[Book Review] My First Ruby
 Yugui gave me <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4873113679/pages20-22">my first Ruby</a>.
 The term "Ruby for Beginners" tends to be ambiguous, blurring whether it is for "people who are new to programming" or "people who are already experienced in programming but not yet experienced in Ruby," but this book clearly states that it is the latter. I see, so the target audience is people like me who are already using Python. This is a good thing I got.
 
 
 It is amazing that every chapter has a "summary of this chapter" and a "what this chapter does not cover" section. Also, the differences between Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 are well written. I didn't understand the difference between 1.8 and 1.9 until now, but in short, Ruby 2.9 is the equivalent of Python 3000, which is "drastically changed to make it better! Ruby1.9 is a stepping stone toward Ruby2.0, which is equivalent to Python3000.
 
 
 I also find the enclosed columns and one point about trap marks very interesting. They list various things that you might get stuck on when you move to Ruby from another language. For example, the phenomenon below, which was recently discussed in 86 chat.
 
 >||
 irb(main):007:0> (10 - 1
 irb(main):008:1> - 2 - 3)
 => -5
 ||<
 
 The newline character is recognized as the end of a minute, as is the semicolon. For this reason, it cannot be inserted anywhere you like, like a space or a tab." So I hear.
 
 By the way, if you do the same thing in Python, you get this.
 >||
 >>> (10 - 1
     - 2 - 3)
 4
 ||<
 
 This is what Ruby's behavior is all about, isn't it? If you understand it, it is a reasonable behavior.
 >||
 irb(main):010:0> (10 - 1 - 2 - 3)
 => 4
 irb(main):011:0> (10 - 1; - 2 - 3)
 => -5
 ||<
 
 Off topic. When people who are used to other languages learn a new language, they tend to make assumptions about how it will work. It may be important to look at examples of such pitfalls before getting stuck.
 
 One last thing. The chapter WW on "Ruby's Black Magic."
 TODO: Do something weird with Ruby black magic.

 PS: I forgot to write something important, it is not a translation, but a new writing!
 
 *1214133878* I'm going to make curry.
 I bought the ingredients for the curry. I had some roux that was given to me, so it was mainly vegetables.
 - Carrot 39 yen
 - Onion x2 78 yen
 - Tomato 50 yen
 - Enoki mushrooms 100 yen
 - Spinach 119 yen
 - Chicken breast 50% discount 95 yen

 Too many onions?
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20080622202507j:image
 Microwave spinach while stir-frying.
 
 
 It is turning much brown.
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20080622204016j:image
 Spinach was ready to be dinged, so I cut up enoki mushrooms and put them in the microwave. I realized that I had not cooked rice, so I set the rice cooker.
 
 
 I forgot to add chicken. I only baked the surface for now.
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20080622205246j:image
 
 
 Gee, the rice cooker stunk!
 
 
 Phase of boiling. I don't recognize the shape of the tomatoes. Also, I was imagining something like sag chicken, but it turns out that a bunch of spinach is not going to make it green. It smells delicious.

 I was told that if I stirred and could see the bottom of the pot, it was overcooked, so I added water.
 
 The water came to a boil, so I turned off the heat and added the roux. Seven more minutes until the rice is cooked.
 
 
 It's done.

 Curry seems fine. Rice that was turned off in the middle of cooking and re-cooked from the beginning is very corey.
 
 I have a feeling that if I leave it at room temperature, it will be damaged soon. I have to get up at a spare time tomorrow morning, eat the curry, refrigerate the rest in a suitable container, wash the dishes.....................................Ugh. I'm getting depressed. I don't mind cooking for myself until I get to the cooking part, but I hate having to wash dishes. And there's garbage.

 Outstanding tasks
 - I bought komatsuna with the intention of making again the boiled komatsuna I made last week, but I didn't make the boiled komatsuna because I was tired by the time I made the curry. It's a leafy vegetable, so I guess I shouldn't leave it until next weekend.
 - Wash dishes.
 - It turns out that I boiled tea last week or the weekend before last, and completely forgot to let it cool before putting it in the fridge. I'll do something about it.
