Adopters are not announced at the time of adoption
ã€€There are cases of dropouts for diverse reasons.
ã€€ã€€Publicizing the adoption reveals the fact that it dropped out because it was "on the adoption list but not in the results report".
ã€€ã€€The information of adopters is not made public at the time of adoption by the Junior Adoption Program because of the belief that "this is too much".
ã€€ã€€There is no prohibition against publicizing one's own actions. The possibility that one's actions may be detrimental to one's future self is not a reason to prohibit others from doing the same.
ã€€ã€€On the other hand, as of 2021, there are quite a few people who will publicize it on Twitter, etc.
ã€€ã€€As to whether this "no-publication stance" is beneficial, that's debatable.
ã€€On the other hand, in the case of "Unexplored IT," names are disclosed at the time of adoption, and if, for example, a presentation is not made at the results reporting session, it is clearly stated that "the presentation by Project X (Y in charge) scheduled for Day 1 has been cancelled due to unavoidable circumstances.
ã€€ã€€It's tougher than unexplored junior, but, well, I don't see why there should be a difference between unexplored junior, where the creator is a minor, and unexplored IT, where the creator is an adult in most cases.

 >In the "Guidelines for Troubleshooting," we provide guidelines for creators of new things, such as the Junior Unexperienced Creators, when they encounter a situation where they are in "troubleðŸ¤”. Although this document is intended for Junior Unexperienced Scientists, I think it will be useful not only for Junior Unexperienced Scientists, so I would be happy if you find it useful ðŸ˜‰.

ã€€This is communicated at the first "Boost Conference" event after adoption.
