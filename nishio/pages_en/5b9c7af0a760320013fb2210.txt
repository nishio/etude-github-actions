Examples of rediscovering new discoveries from your past statements
A case in which a person subjectively went from thinking that he/she had made a new discovery to searching his/her own past statements using the keywords in the discovery and found related past statements.

In [The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production], p. 148, I wrote, "Some people worry that if they spread out their writing over time, they will write the same thing over and over again, but [duplication] is fine. Rather, it is useful as an indicator of [importance]." This is related to what I wrote.

 >Listen to my discovery. Teachers who think that "if you're not going to do it, go home" type reprimands work may be mistakenly believing that their greatest fear is that they will be "sent out of the classroom." Even though that is not true. On the contrary, the teacher's own weakness may be glimpsed there.

 >Yuki tweeted something similar four years ago. You're interested in the relationship between those words and the heartbeat, me.
 	>Often, people attack others for things they don't like to have done to them. In other words, when they attack others, they expose their own weaknesses.

 >I mean, he tweeted the same thing last month...
 	> General Theory. When people attack others, they tend to do "attacks that would be damaging if done to them". Because attacking is an act of trying to damage the other person. However, in doing so, by attacking the other person, one often communicates one's own weakness to the other person.

 > Two years ago...
  > The weaker a person is, the more aggressive he or she speaks. The less defensive people are, the more aggressive they are. People get angrier when their weaknesses are exploited. The more petulant a dog is, the more often it barks. Therefore, if someone is rough, aggressive, angry, and barks, you should act as if you were treating a baby dog. Otherwise, they will bite you.

 > A year ago...
  > "What words and phrases" one person uses to belittle another person exposes that person's values and weaknesses. If you think intelligence is important... if you think physical strength is important... if you think networking is important... (specific phrases are omitted)

 > 1.5 years ago too...you must really like this stuff.
	 > People who attack others do so by the means they deem most effective. As a result, by attacking, they expose their own weaknesses to those around them.

	nishio: I was wondering how you found similar tweets in the past
		>Tweet with "hyuki weaknesses" [search].
		As a viewer of the series of tweets, I was not aware that they contained the common keyword "weakness".
