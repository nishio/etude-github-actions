I don't use it that way.
Suppose that Mr. A uses a certain word X in the sense of Y, and another Mr. B insists that he does not use X in the sense of Y.

This is a [subject unclear] claim of "use".
	If the claim is that "not all people use X in the sense of Y", then it is obviously false because we have a counterexample in front of us, Mr. A.
 If the assertion is, "I don't use X in the sense of Y," that is no basis for denying that Mr. A uses X in the sense of Y.
 	No reason to deny Mr. B's claim.

In many cases, it is appropriate for Mr. B to say that he has never seen anyone use X to mean Y
	To say that it's not using X in the sense of Y [excessive abstraction].
	The type of mistake of thinking that what one experiences is all there is in the world: [one's experience is all there is in the world type thinking].


relevance
	[subject large].
	[subject unclear].
	An example of communication [with a counterexample in front of you] is "That's [common knowledge]" (=everyone knows that)
