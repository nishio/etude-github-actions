	Advantages of using existing terms rather than unique terms include the ability to Google and share stories with others.

 There's a common pattern of having a concept X that you thought of as far as your mind could go, only to find out later that it has a name.
  [/blu3mo-public/ some knowledge I had before I knew about it].
  It would be nice to know the name already attached to the [/blu3mo-public/ concept].
   [the advantage of using existing terminology rather than proprietary terminology]:
   > Googleable
   > Then you can use [shoulders of giants], [wisdom of the ancients].
   > Discussions about the concept (including counterclaims)
   > Post-XX against XX, and so on.
   > Can share the story with others who know the word
   > If others don't know the word, they can easily communicate it by Googling it (depending on the case).
  (With Scrapbox, if you make the concept X a link, you can replace it all at once after you know it was named, which is convenient.)
