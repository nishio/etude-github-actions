PDCA that does not rotate
The [PDCA cycle] is something you turn, so please don't call something that stops at "P" a "PDCA cycle." That is just "an organization that does not act." [Twitter https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1052143727563743233]

Subsequent development (PD, PDC, PDCA by @mogya)
	P: Organizations that do not act
 PD: An organization that never looks back
 PDC: An organization with a broken heart
 PDCA: Once Satisfied Organization
 PDCAP: An organization that says, "Let's make a perfect plan so we don't fail this time," but can't do it a second time because the perfect plan is never completed.
 PDDD: Organizations that have been doing things the way they were created a long time ago.
 PCAPCA: Organizations that repeatedly discuss without executing
 PDCP: Organizations that changed personnel and made new plans before reflecting the results of the checks

PDCAPD and going to the second D is the minimum requirement for the "[PDCA] cycle to be running.
PDDD is not allowed, so it is important that the CAP is sandwiched in between until the second D.
Some people have suggested that it would be better to start with D instead of P, and I think that's possible, too, so..,
I guess the difference between a good organization and a not-so-good one is whether it includes "D→CAP→D."
