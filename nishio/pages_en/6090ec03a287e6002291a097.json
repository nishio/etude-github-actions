 *1271394681*Resolution to TemplateNotFound for apps made with Kay (Jinja2).
 TemplateNotFound on the production server for apps made with Kay (Jinja2), even though they work locally, has been resolved.
 
 Kay's Jinja2 pre-parses the template and converts it to Python code, which can be preparse in manage.py preparse_apps. Usually, when I do a manage.py appcfg update, it automatically does it for me. I did not use manage.py and did appcfg.py update directly, and it worked easily after update via manage.py.

 "It's just a regular drama with 'Twitter' thrown in," or, "Twitter in particular doesn't bother you, does it?"

 Why do people brag so much about being able to tweet?　Why do they look down on you so much for not being able to do it?　When I first tried to write my Twitter drama, there were several people like that," he remarked.
 
 Others have said, "Twitter drama without even knowing Twitter. Is it really that great to know Twitter?　That's my impression. It's a system. Anyone can use it if they research, study, and get used to it. It's silly to think that it's great to be able to use a system or an instrument.
 (omitted)
 Will the drama be able to satisfy viewers, including Twitter users, in the future?　It will be interesting to see.

 ...No, why should we satisfy Twitter users? It is easy to understand if you replace "Twitter" with "cell phone" or something like that. When you make a drama that uses cell phones as a communication tool in the story, why do cell phone users make misguided criticisms such as "this is not how I use my cell phone" or "can we develop a drama with contents that will satisfy cell phone users? What are we talking about?
 
 In general, people who make loud noises are not necessarily the majority.

 <body>Excuse my comment. <BR>I think what is being criticized is the mention of "Twitter dramas" and the like<BR>as if Twitter is the central treatment of the story. <br>Perhaps you wouldn't call a drama that uses cell phones as story props a <br>"cell phone drama". </body>
