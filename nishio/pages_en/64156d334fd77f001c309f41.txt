1,000 people come up with the idea, 100 people start it, 10 people finish it, and 1 person makes it public.
[nishio.icon]It seems to me that there are many variations of the "1000 people come up with the idea, 100 people start it, 10 people finish it, and 1 person publishes it" type of story, but I'm interested in what variations there are, so please give me an example.
[gpt.icon] "A thousand people come up with the idea, a hundred start it, ten complete it, and one makes it public" is a phrase that relates to the selection and effort involved in the process of bringing an idea or project to fruition. There are many variations, but here are a few examples
  "A thousand people think, a hundred [act], ten keep going, and one [succeeds]."
  "A thousand people dream, a hundred [try], ten [continue], one [achieves]."
  "A thousand will hope, a hundred will [try], ten will fight through, and one will be the winner."
  "A thousand people have [an idea], a hundred work on it, ten evolve it, and one [innovates]."
  One thousand people have hope, one hundred work hard, ten never give up, and one makes their dreams come true."
 These variations are used in a variety of situations and contexts to describe efforts and processes toward [goal achievement] and success.
