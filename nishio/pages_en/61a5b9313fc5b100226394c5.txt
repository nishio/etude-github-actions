Not 100%.
[https://gyazo.com/5231445a4efbd251ead559fba0276ff0]
Those who focus on the "not 100%."

In particular, cases of "denial of value" such as "[not worth it because it is not 100%]" or "[not worth it because] this has [flaws]".
　Almost everything in the real world is imperfect
　　So the point that "this is incomplete" is not informative.
　In the first place, the existence of flaws and the existence of value are two different things.
　　If a knife has a flaw that can injure someone and lacks a safety mechanism to prevent it, that does not mean that the knife is worthless.
　　It is important to know whether the disadvantages hinder the use of the thing

　[bug that considers anything that is not 100% to be 0].
　[type thinking that doesn't solve 100% of problems].
