Inventor of the mouse
マウスの発明者は [Douglas Carl Engelbart]

In the context of cutting out the world and putting a handle of words, I didn't see "Well, who's that, not Wittgenstein or Winograd, but the guy who invented the mouse -", so I made a note.

What I wanted to say is this [handle].

(If I post a direct link to Winograd from this page, it's going to be misleading when the related page display says "Inventor of the mouse" and "Winograd"...)
