discrimination
>I studied discrimination for the first time in college. My first lesson was "There is discrimination in this society. If a person is born and raised in a society where there is discrimination, he or she will always be discriminatory. There is no one in this society who is not discriminatory, neither you nor me. The goal of this class is to help you become aware of the discriminatory mindset within you." The class began with these words.
>There is a common saying, "Don't discriminate," or "If you see discrimination, be careful! I think I was finally able to face up to my discriminatory mind, not because of such a beautiful thing, but because the class started with a shocking fact for me as a "good girl" that "you and I are all discriminating against someone".
>If I had not taken that class, I would have never doubted that I was a good person, and when someone accused me of discrimination, I would have said angrily, "What's discrimination? I would have been angry. But there is no one who does not discriminate. I have to accept that I am discriminating and correct it.
