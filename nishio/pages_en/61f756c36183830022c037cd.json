SNS export mode
　The social networking writing mode is to first have a lump of a post that others can see and understand it, and then continue replying to it.
　Make new associations within the context formed by what was written earlier
　　This is not the same as "putting out what is already in me but not yet put into words."
　　exploratory process
　　So others may comment on it.
　　So it's being done on social networking sites.
	When I first started writing [diary 2022-01-31], I felt different from the SNS writing mode
　　When you mention "social triggers," you don't even open that page.
	　Now it's no different than SNS export mode.
　　It was still elusive, so it shouldn't have inspired others.
