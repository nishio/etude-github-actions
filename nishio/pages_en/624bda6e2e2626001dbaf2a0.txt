			>[https://twitter.com/ukkaripon/status/1510933424038559751 Yu Ukai(@ukkaripon)] @nishio Ah, yes. You can't win if you collect 50 cards, lol.

	There are two types of victory points in the world: "victory points that are limited in number and can be taken away," as in Dominion, and "victory points that are countless and can be taken in any number and increase when you give them to others," which Dominion does not have.
	　Life is richer when you get the latter victory points and hand them out.
	　However, victory points from the former are needed to buy victory points from the latter.
	　PS: Resources such as money and tangible objects versus [easily replicable resources] such as knowledge, information and digital content.

	With Dominion, treasure cards don't get depleted very often, cards that don't get robbed.
	　The victory point is a card that is fought for in limited numbers.
	　There are only a limited number of treasure cards in life.
	　Victory point cards are rather plentiful, and special victory points are abundant, so [the means of obtaining victory points] are diverse.

	When 10 different kingdom cards are laid out in front of you, it is easy to wonder what to buy from them.
	　But not placed there, the familiar, novelty-free card, the "silver coin," is often the correct choice
	　[Silver coin theory]
		So is life.

	Action cards are powerful and fun to use.
	　However, only one [right of action] to use it is given per turn.
	　If you want lots of action, you must first increase your action rights.

	The treasures and victory points you had from the beginning [become stronger by discarding them].
	　If you keep it because it is a waste, the average power you can exert in one turn will decrease, and as a result, you will waste precious turns.

	It's fun to get creative with lots of card combinations, but in some situations [striking gold] is the best choice!
