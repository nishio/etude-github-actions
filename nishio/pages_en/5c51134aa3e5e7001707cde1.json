People who want to be interviewed themselves.
	After the dialogue of [Mr. Tachikawa's communication theory], I have a thought.
	There are people in the world who would be happy to be interviewed and have their story published.
	It's hard to sympathize with you.
	Why?
	Dialogue encourages verbalization.
	knowledge creation act
	Matching the abilities of the listener and the speaker
	Ability to elicit the listener
	It's more interesting for me to be the listener.
	Because I can pull in the direction of my interests.
	Not always a good listener.
	Sentences in which my thoughts are elicited by less competent listeners are less likely to bring new insights to me.
	The composition of the "interview" implicitly assumes a one-way transfer of knowledge.
	Two-way interactions are more interesting.
