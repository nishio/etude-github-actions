cheating on area
 My wife says, "I feel like I'm being cheated nicely," after watching the video about the surface area of a sphere, but she asks, "What is the definition of '[area]' of an area on a curved surface that cannot be stretched flat?" I think it is correct that I feel cheated because it is too much trouble to explain the foundation of the question, "What is the definition of 'area' of an area on a curved surface that cannot be extended flatly?
 Historically, Leibniz and others brought in the concept of "[infinitesimals]" without thinking about the details and created calculus, and after the excitement of "wow, this is useful, this is great! But what is this infinitesimal?
 Calculus was established around 1700, and [Weierstrass] established the reason why you can do [limit] calculations as [epsilon-delta theory] around 1860, so mankind has been doing calculus for about 160 years because it's convenient, even though we don't know much.
