> Nicolas de Malebranche (August 6, 1638 - October 13, 1715) was a French philosopher. He was an Oratorian monk.
> In 1664, he was exposed to [Descartes]'s posthumous manuscript, "The Theory of Man," which awakened him to philosophy, and he sought to synthesize the mystical thought of [Augustine], to which the Oratorian Society took refuge, with Descartes' philosophy, which emphasized reason. The result was first published in 1674-1675 as his early magnum opus, The Search for Truth
> Malbranche's philosophical argument, known by the phrase "I see all things in God" (voir toutes en Dieu), attempted to resolve Cartesian mind-body dualism by asserting that man perceives the material world through the idea in God. According to Malbranche, man's senses and imagination did not bring about true perception, but were the catalyst that led him to the idea of God-in-itself. While acknowledging the movement of objects (bodies) as phenomena, he refused to attribute the cause to the objects themselves, and held that the collision of objects and the willingness of the mind were triggered (opportunity) by God, and that God ultimately caused the various movements. This theory is called "opportunity causation" in the history of philosophy.

> While Spinoza's thought was regarded as dangerous as atheism and Leibniz's major works were not published, the mainstream of Cartesian rationalist philosophy was considered to have been inherited by Malbranche in the 18th century, and the Malbranche school = the new Cartesian school, which confronted new currents of thought such as empiricism, sensualism and materialism. The Malbranche school was opposed to new currents of thought, such as empiricism, sensualism, and materialism.
