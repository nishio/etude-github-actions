 I was sleepy from the beginning of the after-party, which reached its peak with a set of back pain, so I went home. I managed to catch the last train.

 It is 1,000 speakers until you go home and write a blog.
 
 Thanks to Mr. Yoshioka (id:hyoshiok) for providing the venue. Trackback for now on my blog: http://blog.miraclelinux.com/yume/2008/02/1000-speakers-1.html
 
 The rest of the story will be written gradually.

 Last time, we decided to "take a commemorative photo" at the end of the second round of drinks, so those who left without joining us for drinks couldn't join us. So this time, I took the photo at the venue. Even so, I didn't bring my camera with me--; earth2001y++;.
 
 Oh, and the entry was up.

 I was surprised when a troll came on the way. I was puzzled as to what to do, but since amachang was offline and coji was probably busy shooting, I decided to change the chat room to a mode where people can't speak without moderator privileges, and grant the right to speak to a human-like person. I was so busy that I decided to change the chat room to a mode where only moderators could speak. In the end, it seems that there were over 10,000 troll posts in that one moment. I guess it was a mistake to try to allow people to speak in the chat room from a browser as well.
