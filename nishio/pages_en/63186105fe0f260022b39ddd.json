Keichobot Premium
The current [Keichobot] is a free trial version of the paid Keichobot Premium.

　Have per-user memory
　　Currently, the emphasis is on being able to start using the system immediately without creating an account, etc.
　　Premium first creates an account.
　　Instead, you'll be able to see your past interactions from your account screen.
　Will be integrated developmentally with the [motivation system
　　I've been thinking that the two have a lot in common from the creator's point of view, but it's still true from the user's point of view as well.
　　[Motivation systems and Keichobot also share similarities from the user's perspective.]
　　The lack of integration in the current Keichobot is around the fact that you want people to remember things like TODO lists, etc.
　　　I don't want to have to explain what the task is every time.
		Interview long-term users of the motivation system to find out when they use the system.
　Developmentally integrated with [Kozaneba] via [Explore Net
　　There was discussion about "getting lost in depth-first search" and "maybe we need a width-first search."
　　But if you naively do a breadth-first search, it feels like you're ignoring what we've said and asking a different question, depth-first for this care.
　　Instead of simply avoiding depth, we can put an upper limit on the length of isolated branches that do not form a network.
