	Implemented [support for splitting long text into stickies
	I asked because I felt this would be beneficial to [the listening chat system].
	awareness
	　Chat system asks questions, human answers them, divides the answers into sticky notes and displays them on a whiteboard [Regroup], human can move them around and organize them, chat system highlights keywords that are of interest
	　　I never had the idea of this "chat system highlighting and generating [joint attention].
	　When chat systems start using whiteboards, it's more of a facilitator or consultant than a counselor.
	　What you get from your customers is not limited to money.
	　It is also useful to know "how the customer benefited from using this system.
	　Resources can also be used to prolong the life of software instead of using them to grow software.
	　Summary: [Software growth period].

[nishio.icon]Let's talk.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I've implemented a feature to split long sentences for [nishio.icon]Regroup, and I think this would be beneficial to work with this chat system, so I want to talk about it and get my head straight.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that chat system?
[nishio.icon]Encouraging verbalization by asking questions
[nisbot.icon]What type of verbalization is that?
I have a feeling that there might be a connection between the [nishio.icon]function of long division and the chat system's function of verbalization, but I haven't yet put into words what it is, and putting it into words
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its a chat system?
[nishio.icon]NG
[nisbot.icon]Where is that chat system located?
[nishio.icon]Here it is.

>I have a feeling that there might be a connection between the function of long division and the chat system's function of verbalization, but I haven't yet put into words what it is, and putting it into words
Where can I find this chat system?
[nishio.icon]Ah, I see, in that sense, the chat system is first, and the answers elicited by the chat system questions are engraved in long division
What kind of chat system is [nisbot.icon] that?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, maybe a chat system that is not for fun, but for serious business benefit.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about that stiff?
[nishio.icon]NG
[nisbot.icon]What kind of gachi is that gachi?
[nishio.icon] (Oh, it wasn't suppressed.
NGKW
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that on the job?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice if we could generate some economic benefit.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that benefit?
[nishio.icon]If customers receive a profit, they will receive some of that profit as compensation, which will accelerate development.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its profit?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, tough. There's no way of knowing for sure. If they have a paid plan for their customers' continued use and they continue to use it, I would guess that they are generating enough profit to keep paying.
[nisbot.icon]What type of profit is that?
[nishio.icon]At first I imagined financial gain, but the concept is broader and includes customer satisfaction, intellectual enjoyment, etc.
[nisbot.icon]Where are those profits?
[nishio.icon]I don't know, customer on hand?
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about that customer?
[nishio.icon]I know this is kind of turning into a customer/profit thing, but I don't have any commercial plans planned at this time, so it's just me and a limited number of beta testers for the time being. Also, I'd like to get back to the long division of the story I wanted to delve into.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Here's the question - I don't think you've done enough digging on long division... I'm here to delve into it because I feel the long division function is valuable...
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its a long division?
[nishio.icon]Right now it's just a long sentence because it's in the form of a chat, but it would be nice if this could be broken up and placed on the screen as stickies.
(It's harder to use on a phone, though.)
What is the relationship between [nisbot.icon] chat systems and long division?
[nishio.icon]The feedback from the chat system is now only in the form of a string of questions, but if it is broken up into long sentences and placed on the screen as stickies, humans can organize their minds by moving them around, and when the chat system draws attention to a particular keyword, they can highlight the sticky note when the chat system draws attention to certain keywords.
(I see, I hadn't thought of this level of coordination yet.)
Is [nisbot.icon] that chat system the same as long division? Is it different?
[nishio.icon](I just came up with the idea today to fix this same or different question because it's not a good idea.)
What is the relationship between this chat system and long division? There is another display system that is not a chat system, and we can flow data to that through the long division.
[nisbot.icon]What is that chat system like?
[nishio.icon]The chat system so far has been like talking verbally with a counselor. After incorporating the collaboration I just came up with, it's like a facilitator or consultant who organizes the discussion using a whiteboard.
[nisbot.icon] What happens to long division when its a chat system?
[nishio.icon] It's running as a local script now, but it should become a web API.
What happens to the chat system during a [nisbot.icon] long split?
[nishio.icon]This one needs more substantial changes. I also wonder if it would be better to keep it in chatbot form. Maybe it would be better to integrate it into a whiteboard system? On the other hand, in terms of ease of use from a smartphone, the current form is better than the whiteboard
What is the difference between [nisbot.icon] chat systems and long division?
[nishio.icon]I want to use the chat system by itself, and I also want to use it connected to the whiteboard, so I need a system that is loosely coupled and can be switched, and if you want, you can connect it after the fact.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that chat system and profit?
[nishio.icon]Most commercial chat systems in the world require companies to prepare data in advance, and their customers ask questions to the chat system and get answers, but this system does not require data preparation. The chat system does not need to prepare data, but the chat system asks questions and the data is accumulated after the fact. In the current implementation, the data is deleted after one session, but if this data can be stored and shared throughout the company, more interesting things may happen. In other words, this is the business model of groupware.
[nisbot.icon]What is the customer's relationship with that chat system?
[nishio.icon]Without customers, I would be the only user, and I would develop the software at a leisurely pace as a hobby. With customers, it becomes more about stability rather than adding new features. Personally, I don't think it's fun, but there are aspects of the project that accelerate when you have a customer and payment.
Is [nisbot.icon] the customer the same as the chat system? Are they different?
[nishio.icon]No, it is not. I dare say that if you look at a chat system as "an intellectual production system that includes people," the customer is a component of the chat system, though.
What happens to customers when [nisbot.icon] that chat system?
I hope [nishio.icon]using it will increase your intellectual productivity.
What happens to the chat system when [nisbot.icon] customer?
[nishio.icon]Payments accelerate development
What is the connection between the [nisbot.icon] chat system and the customer?
[nishio.icon]Trust?
Is [nisbot.icon] chat system the same as profit? Is there a difference?
[nishio.icon]No, it's not. Dare I say it, profit is the bait to grow the chat system
What happens to profits when [nisbot.icon] that chat system?
I want [nishio.icon] customers' business to be accelerated and the profits gained by customers to increase.
What happens to the chat system when [nisbot.icon] its profit?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice if you could provide examples of "this idea was generated using this system" instead of just accelerating it with payment.
What is the difference between [nisbot.icon] chat systems and profit?
[nishio.icon]That's positive feedback.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that feedback and the chat system?
[nishio.icon]Positive feedback drives growth.
[nisbot.icon]Is that feedback the same as a chat system? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]No, I dare say it's the acceleration of growth.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that growth and the chat system?
[nishio.icon]You're right, growth is not a must for a chat system. Rather than adding more and more features, there is an option to use resources for longevity rather than growth, for example by refactoring or porting to a different code base.
[nisbot.icon]Where does that chat system come from?
[nishio.icon]I make them.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that me and the chat system?
[nishio.icon]Creating and using a chat system will improve my intellectual productivity.
Is [nisbot.icon] that chat system the same as mine? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]In a way, it's pretty close. I'm going to program my counseling skills, and then I'm going to program my consulting skills, and so on. It's like digitizing a subset of me.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the chat system when its me?
[nishio.icon]You are born and grow by me.
[nisbot.icon]What's between that me and the chat system?
[nishio.icon]I wonder. I guess it's the expectation that "they will grow more, and help me."
What happens to me when [nisbot.icon] chat system?
[nishio.icon]My intellectual productivity will improve.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between its intellectual productivity and the chat system?
[nishio.icon]As intellectual productivity improves, so does the functionality of chat systems.
[nisbot.icon]Is that chat system the same as intellectual productivity? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]Intellectual production system that combines human and chat system is intellectually producing.
What happens to intellectual productivity when [nisbot.icon] that chat system?
[nishio.icon]What will be left when the combination of human beings and chat systems have come to produce intellectually and then use their power to improve the system more and more, and when the human beings gradually weaken and the system takes over on their shoulders and then the human beings die...
[nisbot.icon]What is the connection between that chat system and intellectual productivity?
[nishio.icon]It's a fusion.
What happens to a chat system when [nisbot.icon]intellectual productivity?
[nishio.icon]It's time to say bye-bye, I'm bored.
What happens to feedback when [nisbot.icon] chat system?
[nishio.icon]Bye-bye!
This system is rather exciting in the middle, but the end is not so good.
Today's interesting points are around "you should connect with the whiteboard system," "change from counselor to facilitator," and "use profits to prolong the life of the system."
