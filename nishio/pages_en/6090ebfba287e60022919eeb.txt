 *1227290710* I saw a manga cafe and wondered.
 I wonder why there are no novel cafes. As I sometimes write, "I wish there were technical book cafes," which I think is too small a market, but I don't think it would be so bad if it were novel cafes. If someone says, "Come to this store and you can read all of Shinichi Hoshi's 1,000 short stories," wouldn't you want to read them all, even if you have to go there every once in a while?
 If paperback books are the main focus, the amount of books per unit bookshelf will increase compared to manga, and because they are novels, the amount of time spent per book will also increase.
 
 
 Oh yeah, I get it. From the company's point of view, the increase in time spent per book improves profitability, but from the user's point of view, it's the opposite: if a store charges 400 yen per hour, I can read a 600 yen manga book in 90 minutes or less and it pays for itself (by the way, according to the statistics so far, I'm reading a book in about 30 minutes), (By the way, according to my statistics, I usually read a comic book in about 30 minutes. For now, I'm reading Shinichi Hoshi's "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4041303249?ie=UTF8&tag=978-05824169-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& creative=1211&creativeASIN=4041303249">Funny Ancestors</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.jp/e/ir?t=978-05824169-22&l=as2&o=9&a=4041303249 " width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />" The first 23 pages of the short short took me 8 minutes and 25 seconds to read, so 238 It would take 87 minutes to read the entire book, which has 238 pages, by simple arithmetic. The book costs $438, so it won't pay off. Oops. That would make the user say, "Well, I'll just buy it and read it at home! I'll buy it and read it at home!
 
 
 That said, the cost of the place is the same as that of a manga cafe, so the usage fee cannot be lowered. No? The effect of smaller book size should increase the number of seats that can be placed in a unit floor space. Some of the customers of manga cafes do not particularly want to read manga, but just want a place where they can spend time in a private room, don't they? If that is the case, then these customers would prefer to pay a lower fee per unit of time, so lowering the fee is one way to go?
 
 
 I'm thinking about it, but my hope is to find a place along the Yamanote line (or Akihabara) that has a Mangakissa style store with power outlets, wireless LAN, bookshelves full of technical books, and no need for the crappy PCs that are provided, and instead rent LEGO Mindstorms or something like that. I am sure that I will go there when I run out of last train!
