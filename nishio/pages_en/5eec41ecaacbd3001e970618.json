>Large software development projects are not agile by nature. Large projects are not easy to implement, they are even harder to implement using agile methodologies. Based on over 6 years of experience building software systems using agile methodologies we found that we can modify agile methodologies to be successfully applied to large projects. In this paper, we will introduce a development practice, which we call Divide After You Conquer to reduce some of the challenges during the development of large agile projects. By solving the base problem first with a smaller development team (Conquer phase) before expanding the team to its full size (Divide phase) we can solve many of the problems that occur with larger projects using agile methodologies.
