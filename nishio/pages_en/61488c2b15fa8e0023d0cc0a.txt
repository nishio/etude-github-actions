Piston Loop

I was struggling with how to automate long periodic operations in [mycla] and you taught me how to do it.

With this minimum configuration, 20 x 0.4 would be 8 seconds apart.
　We could quadruple the number of repeaters with this shape. So 32 seconds.
　If we increase the size, we can increase the number of repeat customers and the distance they travel, which increases the cycle on the order of squares.


I reversed the signal.

　When reading from the observer, it was difficult to handle the 1-tick signal, so it was changed to read from the basement.
　　Redstone block can turn on powder on top of the block below.
　In this configuration, 60 x 0.5 seconds is 30 seconds.
　If you don't put at least two repeaters, you'll get "the piston can't extend because the piston that's out is in the way.
　96 seconds if the repeater is increased to 1.6 seconds.

About 20 and 60
　When the direction of movement coincides with the signal direction
　　Two squares in succession at the corner per piston 4 pushes.
　　So it takes 16 pushes to advance 8 squares.
　　Plus the effect of going around the circle +4 to 20.
　　If each side is increased by one block, each side is increased by 16 pushes, since only one square is advanced per 4 pushes.
　When the direction of movement and the signal direction are opposite
　　One square advance per 4 piston pushes
　　So it takes 64 pushes to advance 8 squares.
　　Plus the effect of circling backwards -4 to 60.
　　If each side is increased by one block, 16 pushes are added.
　　　Lag due to increased repeat business +0.4
　　　That is, when one side is n [$ (0.4 + n * 0.4) * (16 + n * 16)]
　　　If you want to make a 25 minute timer, one side is 14.
