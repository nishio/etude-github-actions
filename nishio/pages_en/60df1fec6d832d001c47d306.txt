New API for Keicho
　Enter bulleted text and add N questions
　　Subtle?
　In other words, use cases that don't come one line at a time like chat.
　We knew there was a need, and the "listen first" mode was still being used.
　　I want to enter a certain amount of stuff, no questions in the meantime.
　I can't keep typing the same thing over and over again."
　Bulleted text (all in the same hierarchy is fine) should be able to be entered.
　If I give you the Scrapbox URL, you can load it.
　That way, there's an incentive to keep the content you want to talk about repeatedly in Scrapbox.
　Write every "first question" properly.
　　Should I increase the emphasis of the keywords included in this?

　Instead of adding a new API, can we just read it when we type in the Scrapbox URL in chat?
