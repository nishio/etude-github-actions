Diary 2022-10-08

I'd like to automate it to the point of img2prompt and load it into the insta buffer.
　There should be an accumulation of unreviewed images now, as well as images waiting to be insta-ready for review.
　　I'd like to be able to see the size of each buffer and the amount of change.
　　You're totally playing as Factorio, yourself.

I'd like to merge the Scrapbox file generation in a swell way that doesn't break the human edits, too.

　Machine-generated messages have an icon at the beginning, so I think mechanical merging is possible.
　　Gyazo link at the beginning of the page
　　Below that [CAP-tan] message
　　In some cases, there's a human being writing something underneath it.
　　　Maintain this.

　There are more than 300 sheets that you said, "I'll inpaint them later.
　　There are several patterns.
　　　The ones that just need to be trimmed.
　　　The one you want to inpaint.
　　　　Remove extraneous material and fill with background texture (this may be done without inpaint)
　　　　Draw no eyeballs.
　　　　Ears on and off.
　　　　Turn off and connect tails.
　　　Good composition
　　　　The one that has a good color scheme, composition and rhythm, but not the details of the picture.

　　　　For example, the details of this one are not good at all, but the composition of "a black cat, a white cat with a little space between it and the beehive" is interesting.
　　　　As for this, there is a way to "simply use it for img2img".
　I put them all in img2img5 for now.
　　I've tried a few things, but I'd like to see a "Keep Prompt".
