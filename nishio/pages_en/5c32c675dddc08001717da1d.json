[目的]の[階層構造]
	For a given objective, "Why are we doing it?" and then [higher-level objectives] emerge.
	For a given objective, "How do we do that?" and then [a subordinate objective] comes into play.
	For a given objective X, "Why do it?" and after the higher-level objective Y comes up, "But the way to achieve it doesn't have to be X, right?" and X may disappear.
	When we think about our personal purpose, we ask ourselves "Why? and finally come to the conclusion that "there is no reason, I do what I do because I want to do it," which is what is called "[life purpose]" or "[values].
	[OKR] considers a hierarchy between the goals of an organization and the goals of individuals who belong to that organization.
		But it implicitly assumes that "the organization encompasses the individual" [the organization-individual encompassing relationship].
		In the age of [parallel work], that's a false premise.
