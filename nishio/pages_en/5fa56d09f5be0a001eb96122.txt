　Build it.
　It doesn't have to be the shortest.
　Is there a case where it needs to be done 2N times?
　　6,5,4,3,2,1 all exceed if you try to meet the condition with only +1, but we don't do that.
　　Is it OK to add the smallest number that is greater than or equal to the first to the second...and so on?
　　　O(NlogN)
　　N is quite small at 50
　　 A larger algorithm with more orders?
　Official Explanation
　　I thought it was tricky that the updated number was used instead of the original number, but rather take advantage of it
　　If the signs are aligned, the cumulative sum can be used.
　　　I didn't notice that.
　　　[Cumulative sum of positive numbers is monotonically increasing]
　　[Aligning signs] can be done with N or less.
