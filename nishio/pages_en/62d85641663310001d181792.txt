Diary 2022-07-21

It was 48 minutes as I jotted down what was on my mind.
　Surprisingly okay.
　 I was afraid it would be over an hour.

I rented a private videoconference booth in a coworking space to record on screen if possible, but the light shone right above me and my head shone and my face was dark, and I also had to wear a mask in the booth.
　I thought I'd fix the sentence by mucking it up in my mouth first before recording it in the first place.
　Also, booths are hot🥵.
