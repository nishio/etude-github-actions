Example of Notation Distortion Discovery in Scrapbox
	Mention "trade-offs between use and exploration" in the chat.
 I looked at the "trade-offs between use and exploration" page to try to show this as an explanation, but it was blank.

 write roughly
 Make the words "local minimum" a link
 Turns out there is the same link in the "blind spot card with no picture yet."
 	This is an incorporation of what I wrote before Scrapbox, with a number of topics on one page

 Found a link to "Tradeoffs between Exploration and Utilization."
 I'll try to trace it.
 It was a blank page.

	I see... "use and search for" and "search and use for" are different notations.
	I posted a link from "Use~" to "Explore~."
 Is there any way to merge them in a nice way if one of them is a blank page?
 	The link doesn't do much real harm, though.
 	After this, a merge function was implemented
