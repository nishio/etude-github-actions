	As quantity increases, the utility of the consumer decreases: [law of diminishing marginal utility].
 As quantity increases, the supplier's cost (creation cost) goes up: [law of increasing marginal cost].
		[The law of increasing marginal cost does not fit the reality.]

	sublation (philosophy)
  Supply is constant in the short term
  	Demand is the primary factor in price determination: [marginal utility theory].
  In the long run, the producers can change the amount of supply.
  	Price is determined by the producer's convenience: [labor value theory].
				It's not just a matter of convenience on the part of the producers, though.

 [Walras Stability]: Stable equilibrium solution is reached through price fluctuations.
  In response, [Marshall] pointed out
   [Marshallian Stability]: A stable equilibrium solution is reached by fluctuations in quantity.
