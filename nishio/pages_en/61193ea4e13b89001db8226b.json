The idea of wanting to do something new is old.
>The first thing I was told when I went to art school was, "Artists who came before you have already come up with all the 'new and innovative ideas' long before you were born. Rather than focusing on originality and novelty, find value in the inevitability of what you are going to do.

Context: art college
[Inevitability over novelty.]
[Inevitability over novelty
[Novelty]

>[kur.icon] I was thinking that this area of thinking may be a bit different from the science field. In the case of science, we survey the research of our predecessors and think about how we can produce our own ⊿t, right? There may be a "new approach" there, but I don't think [peer review will pass] because of "[the] necessity of what I do." [Twitter https://twitter.com/kur/status/1427153738821554185?s=21]
　Context:.
　 The phrase "does not pass peer review" implicitly assumes that "passing peer review is of value."
　 Context: a community that believes in the value of writing papers and passing them through peer review

These two may differ in terms of the community values of "novelty" or "inevitability of what I do" (storytelling?). Maybe it's a difference in community values of which is more important, "novelty" or "necessity to do what I do" (storytelling?)

What caused the value system that emphasizes "the necessity of doing what one does?"
　Because without it, it would be difficult to "[keep] doing it"?
　The type of behavior that takes 10 years to produce results is a big advantage in being able to continue because most people "can't keep up".
　　The only way to go to a great place is to accumulate small things" (Ichiro)
　I guess starting a business or something like that would fall into this category.

　>[tokoroten.icon] I guess "find value in the necessity of 'what you do'" means create a context, since art is not about technique but about context [Twitter https://twitter.com/tokoroten/ status/1427158068584882177?s=21]
　　Context, not technology, is the value.
　　　How it happened.
　　[nishio.icon]I was thinking about how the value of "context, not technology, is the value" arose... and then I thought of the case of the femtosecond laser that created a fairy that you could touch.
　　ref: [https://www.gizmodo.jp/2015/08/fairy_lights_in_femtoseconds.html "Fairy Lights in Femtoseconds" Interview with Yoichi Ochiai: "Art is nothing but technology anymore | Gizmodo Japan]
			I think it's just that the majority of people doing art tend to run in the direction of creating value through context (storytelling) because they are too technically inept to create value using technology...
			If we insist on "human drawing," we will have to "fight on the same level as many people in the past" because human ability will not progress that much.
		>[tokoroten.icon] I think that art when viewed as a market has [uncopyability] (it is an object made by human hands) as part of its value, so context as uncopyability due to information is added to it.

>[kur.icon] By the way, I was just talking with an art college graduate at our company, and he told me that nowadays, the mainstream is to take innovative ideas not as individual works, but as a set of works as dots [to create originality as a surface]. I thought that this might lead to the creation of value as [authorship] or [inevitability of what I do].
	>[tokoroten.icon] From the perspective of the ordering side, if there are multiple points, we can determine that if it's within that aspect, we can place the order. So, if we do several similar jobs, projects that say, "Maybe we can do this too," will fly in.
 >[kur.icon] Maybe that's also in a sense authorship.
