HIU
	Mr. [Takafumi Horie] mentioned HIU as a speaker at [Teamwork Management Symposium] on 2018-03-30
 I've never heard of HIU, but it sounds like it could be useful for [the networking system].
 When I heard about "[hyperactivity]" and "[stupid hyperactivity] over petty cleverness," I reflected that I'm certainly stuck on petty cleverness.
 And I thought about what I would do if I were [stupidly hyperactive], and I would say, "I was moved by Horie-san's lecture," and I would go into the salon.
 So I went in.
 	DMM Online Salon will charge a monthly fee from credit card and will operate in a Facebook group
  10,000 yen per month
	Membership approved as of 4/1 (1st of each month?)
 There are many interesting things, but of course I can't write about them here because I can't disclose information in the salon without permission.
