I would like to put book information in the ðŸ¤”Unexplored Name List.
ã€€Book titles often inappropriate as titles
ã€€ã€€Too long.
ã€€ã€€including square brackets
ã€€Instead of batch generating individual pages, it would be better to create a list page and then do "Organize Titles -> New Page".
ã€€[âœ…I want to display book shadows mechanically in Scrapbox].
ã€€ã€€We were able to create content using data from the 2018 [/mitou-meikan/unexplored-creator's-book] project exhibition.
ã€€ã€€As for publishing in 2018 and beyond.
ã€€ã€€ã€€Make a list of creator names
ã€€ã€€ã€€Running Nakayama's Crawler
ã€€ã€€ã€€Remove same names, etc.
ã€€ã€€requires work that is
ã€€ã€€How to maintain a machine-readable list of creator names...
