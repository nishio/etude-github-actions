Nodes of Thought 20181129
A Facebook post on 2018-11-29 would definitely make a page named "[nodal point of thought]" now, but it wasn't made at the time because the concept wasn't familiar to my hands yet. [Facebook https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10216931441134811]

	The concept of "[trashing]" the programmatic mechanical contributions to Scrapbox makes it uncomfortable.
	On the other hand, it is difficult to perceive the value of linkage bonding without a certain amount of information [cold start] problem
	The case of [unexplored name], which started after mechanically plugging in auto-generated content with a fairly high degree of garbage.
	Mental model of human "[cleanup]" of machine-generated piles of garbage
	I exported the originally separate projects and merged them into one.
		The original creation date and time are preserved.
		If we merged the data after some time had elapsed after generation, we could pour in the data as historical data without [contaminating new arrivals].
	If past blog posts are merged with the actual date and time they were written, they will not appear in the updated list.
	It appears in [Search] and [Random View]. Etc. etc.?
	Mechanically generated is created separately from the main project
	The concept of "[rotting]" [decomposition] in a positive sense.
	Past output to [compost
 Concept of [Tsuji Bracketing
	Composting even other people's work

 	Annotation of human hands saying "I would be happy if articles in which the word appears are recomended in the future.
 If you're going to stream someone else's work in relation to copyright law, it has to be private.
 	But for the social trigger, I want to make the main output destination a public project.
 	the dilemma of "what if?
	The Everything and Everything in the Composter PRIVATE Project."
	[Composter - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC]
	 We need a mechanism for proper merging and updating to take place with [composter] as the hub.
 What should be avoided is "overwritten when a page with the same title happens to exist".
	 Just do a preliminary check and merge the content or put it on a separate page.
	[Most of the garbage is water.]
 [Walking] is a mess, you don't always get a solution to the problem you want to solve.
