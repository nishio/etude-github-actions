[Brainstorming] by [Jiro Kawakita].
[In a brainstorming session, all ideas submitted must be recorded], but if the discussion gets too heated, the person in charge of recording cannot keep up with the work, and the person in charge of recording will not have time to say what his or her ideas are.
So the idea is that each person should make a [point memo] during the [wigaya].

Afterwards, a separate "[renga meeting]" will be held, where the participants will make a clean copy based on the notes and share it with the members.
