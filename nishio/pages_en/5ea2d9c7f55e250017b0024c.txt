Insider Games with Zoom
[Insider Game] [Maintained by https://oinkgms.com/jp/insider]
　There is one "master" who knows the "subject."
　　The subject is, for example, "Middle School."
　Other players ask the master, "Is that food? Is it a building? and other "yes/no" questions to the master, aiming to guess the subject.
　There is one "insider" in addition to the master. The insider knows the subject, but must not let other players know that he/she knows the subject.
　Calling non-insiders the common people.
　If someone is able to guess the subject during the 5-minute time limit, the game moves to the phase of guessing who the insider is.
　Select suspected insiders by means of a round-trip vote.
　　If the person chosen is actually an insider, the common man wins.
　　If the chosen person is a commoner, the insider wins.
　　If the correct answer is not given within the time limit, everyone loses.

Put together the know-how to do this game without physically getting together using video conferencing tools such as [Zoom].

How to do 1 (2020-04-24 [Tomoya Tachikawa] is the master, 3 plays)
　In the original game, the master also participates in the insider's reasoning, but not in this way.
　The master decides the subject and chooses one insider at random.
　Using Zoom's chat messages with a specified recipient (visible only to the person you specify, hereafter "individual chat")
　The master informs each person of his/her position in the individual chat, and also informs the insider of the subject.
　Once the player knows his/her position, he/she tells it to the master.
　　You can decide to say OK back to the chat, use Zoom's raise your hand button, or pause with Maru 🙆‍♂️.
　Master starts timer
　　The original game uses an hourglass, but it's hard to see, so a timer on the phone would be better, and it would be more player friendly if it were visible on the screen.
　Question time, master answers other players' questions
　　The master should ask, "Is it a building?" because voices tend to be covered. No." You can recite a question that sounds like "No.
　Insider guess phase when the correct answer is given.
　　Allow the same amount of time for discussion as time used for question time in the main house.
　　Free discussion on who you think is an insider.
　　This time we voted directly without a guess time, but I think it would be better to have one.
　Voting Phase
　　Vote by entering the name of the person you want to vote for in the general chat and pressing the "send" button all at once.
　　The master reads out who voted and how many, then announces the person's position. Mr. A... was a commoner!"
　　　If the insider didn't come out on top in the voting, you can name yourself.
　　　Master "So who's the real insider?" Mr. B. "It's me!"

Considerations for next time
　Hopefully there's a way for the masters to get in the game too.
　　For this to work, the master must be able to start the game without knowing the insiders (that's how the main house works).
　　Of course, we could do this by creating a separate web app for information transmission, but it would be nice if there was an easier way to do it.
　In this play, the master decides the theme and the insider, but it is also possible, for example, for everyone to send a theme idea to the master, and then the master chooses one person and says, "You are the insider.
