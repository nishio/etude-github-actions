Writing materials that do not exceed the capacity of information
	I am beginning to feel that we need a type of "[writing] tool" that we can refer to and develop over and over again, rather than adding and writing things down as we go along.
	It was difficult to do with pen and paper, so I haven't really dug into it, but digital can do it.
	Often the amount of information exceeds human capacity by doing only "postscripts and additions" even digitally.
	I think we need to support them in controlling them so that they don't exceed [their] capacities.
