WEDGE REPORT
The amazing evolution that took place at the Miura City Agricultural Cooperative, which "reduced eight hours of shipping work to one second.
Ryoko Yamaguchi (Journalist)
With the increasing use of IT in agriculture, the time required to schedule shipments, one of the most troublesome tasks for agricultural cooperatives, has increased significantly.
A new system has been developed to dramatically shorten the time it takes to complete a task that used to take eight hours a day to complete in just one second.
The company will introduce the system. The company that will introduce the system is Miura City Agricultural Cooperative in Kanagawa Prefecture (hereinafter referred to as "Miura City Agricultural Cooperative") and Cybozu. Cybozu, Inc.
Using our own algorithms, we are able to schedule vehicles faster and more efficiently than human calculations.
This makes it possible to
