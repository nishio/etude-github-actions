Revived once a year to bring it to life.
Of the "dead texts" written in non-Scrapbox places, only those written on Facebook are often unearthed and reprinted in this project; Twitter and Hatena Diaries are not; and the "dead texts" written on Facebook are often reprinted in this project, but not in Scrapbox. What's the difference?

Facebook has a [this day in the past] feature that allows you to view texts you wrote on Facebook n years ago.

Wouldn't this ability to "come back to life once a year" be useful in bringing dead text to life?
	[not a warehouse where dead text is placed].
 [How do you bring a document to life?"]

Therefore, we imported Hatena Diary and Twitter into Scrapbox with one page per day, and added a function to realize "this day in the past" on its own.
	Realization of "this day in the past" simply combines the pages of the same month and day in different years into one
	Example: [/nishio-twitter/0909].
