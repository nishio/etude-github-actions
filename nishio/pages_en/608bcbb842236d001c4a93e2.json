Strong/interesting/important/willing to cooperate
　The "this is so bad!" axis and the "I share your awareness of the problem!" axis are orthogonal to each other. axis and "I think I can help" axis are orthogonal to each other.
　I've gone through the whole thing, so I'll go back over my notes and categorize them.
　　There are four attributes.
　　　A: Strong
　　　 Highly skilled in his/her own right (based on what he/she has made in the past, etc.)
　　　 Judgments about people
　　　B: Interesting.
　　　 I personally would be happy if what I am proposing to make were finished and in front of my eyes.
　　　 Judgment on ideas
　　　 People who come up with "bad, crazy (compliment)" ideas often become "interesting people" to others because they are also bad in the past, but the ideas come first.
　　　 It should be accompanied by the power to make it happen, or the power to make people who have the power to make it happen join you (either he/she is an A, or he/she is partnered with someone who is an A).
　　　C: Important
　　　 The problems you point out in your proposal are serious and I feel they need to be resolved.
　　　Z: I want to help.
　　　 I'd be inclined to help with that project.
　　Lots of "C's, so Z's" and "simply Z's."
　　　A and B don't lead to much Z on their own.
　　When I look back at last year, I think "D: The growth rate is amazing" was the deciding factor.
　　　This is a variant of "A: Strong", meaning that the amount of change in strength is large
