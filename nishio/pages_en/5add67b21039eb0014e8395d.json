Losses before and after the fact
 I am negative about [cutting losses] in stock investments, etc.
 	Most of the world's explanations for loss control seem to be written by people who have never thought about it properly on their own.
 	But there are "good losses" too, what's the difference?
  I realize it's either before or after.
 There are two types of stop-losses: [pre-losses] and [post-losses].
 	An advance stop-loss is one in which you decide in advance that you will close the position if it drops 10%.
  Ex-post loss is a position eliminated after the fact because "the stock price has fallen".

	An advance stop-loss is one in which you decide in advance that you will close the position if it drops 10%.
 	When your [risk tolerance] for this position is 10% of your investment, rational thinking [limits risk] by deciding in advance that you will exit when it drops to that level.
 Ex-post loss is a position eliminated after the fact because "the stock price has fallen".
		The decision to buy a good at a certain price X is a decision that the value of the good is greater than X.
  Selling goods at a lower price y than that is not consistent with the decision.
