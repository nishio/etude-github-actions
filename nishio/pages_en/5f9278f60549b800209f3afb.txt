　Thoughts.
　　What do we do with the condition that any five different additions are a composite number?
　　From the condition of being distinct primes, when 2 is included, the sum is even, so the composite number
　　In other words, we can consider the condition that the composite number is obtained by adding five odd prime numbers that are different from each other
　　For example, if all of them are "divided by 5 and less than 1", then any of them can be chosen and added together to make a multiple of 5.
　　If there are 55 prime numbers divided by 5 and less than 1 by 55555, it is OK.
　Official Explanation OK
