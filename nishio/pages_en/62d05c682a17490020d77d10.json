[Project Hail Mary]
　My wife said, "Read it because a number of people who read it said, 'I can't tell you anything about the details, but it was interesting, so read it,'" so I did, and I'm on chapter 3, and I can't tell you anything about it, but it's interesting.
　I now know what the term "Hail Mary" means.
　If you google it, the mystery in the beginning will be spoiled, so please squint and buy it without looking at the synopsis (see below).

[Not "the same thing over and over again."]
