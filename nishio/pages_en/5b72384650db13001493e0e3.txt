Intellectual Production for Engineers Activity Plan
Since the book says, "It's important to actually try it," I thought it might be better to present "concrete ideas of things to do" in the form of exercises, and I thought of this activity plan
I tried to write it but held off on putting it in the paper because I thought it was too abstract.

	(Chapter 1) Once you feel you have an understanding, act on that understanding, observe the results, and verify that your understanding is correct.
 (Chapter 2) Write down your tasks, get the big picture, and do what is actively important rather than being driven by what is urgent. What is important will gradually become clear as you observe what excites you.
 (Chapter 3) To build long-term memory, it is important to relearn at intervals and when you have forgotten. put a relearning schedule on your calendar for a month from now.
 (Chapter 4) After reading the book, you may want to make excerpts for your own review or create and publish materials to teach others.
 (Chapter 5) Writing the contents of the book you read on sticky notes and structuring them in a bottom-up way will help you build your understanding. Try it out.
 (Chapter 6) Read back through the book to see what analogies and parables were used.
 (Chapter 7) Think about how you will apply what you have learned in this book to your future life.
