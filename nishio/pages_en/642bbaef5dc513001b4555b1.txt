Lack of a sense of urgency
The phrase "[sense of urgency] is not enough" for [unspecified] means "the level of urgency that the unspecified has is low compared to the level of urgency that you think is appropriate."
　After all, it is a composition of people who cannot [verbalize] their [vague] "sense of crisis" as an easy-to-understand "[threat]" and are frustrated that people do not [sympathize] with their sense of crisis without explanation.

What should I do?
　After all, isn't it [Tsunami Denko] after all?

Even if the masses have a sense of crisis, don't most of them have a vague sense of crisis like "the heavens will fall" ([groundless fear]) anyway?

What will change and how do we need to prepare?
　You're having difficulty explaining that.
　There is a complex interconnected system with one thickened edge.
　　This change affects a wide range of areas, and its effects have new impacts.
　　It's hard to explain that in words.
　　The better your ability to emulate the system, the more you can read ahead.
　　I'm not confident that I'm making the right decision.
　　　So, "it would be detrimental to teach the consequences of your judgment to someone who is incapable of making that judgment, because if it doesn't work out, they'll blame you."
　　　　Same as [investment decision].
　　The world interpretation itself transmits
　　　Because the principle of information gathering to the sender makes the transmission useful.
　　　Multiple perspectives lead to a better understanding of the world
　　　What actions are taken based on that understanding of the world are not transmitted.
　　　　Because it is harmful when people imitate without thinking.
