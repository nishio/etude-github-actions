Interesting story about a company that introduced rules for [outsourcing] part of their work. There are various kinds of [changes in work styles], and I think this kind of [qualitative change] is more interesting than quantitative change that merely affects the amount of time.

[Sales have increased due to the "outsource what you are not good at" rule and mandatory outsourcing of at least 50,000 yen per person per month.]
