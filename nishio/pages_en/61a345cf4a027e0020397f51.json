>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1464814915189755907]: I tried to buy the BTS music pack after playing once with BeatSaber for now, but it just went into standby and didn't go any further.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1464815314667905028]: I was able to get Immerse to display my Macbook screen, but I had trouble understanding the verbal instructions on how to bring up the Immerse menu. I had a hard time understanding how to bring up the Immerse menu.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1464816632644079617]: So, around here I was told to charge my headset, so I took a break. The other interesting part was the ability to set up a virtual wall so that you can walk around the house and not have any accidents. The wall just appears and you understand your position in the room, so you can sit in front of the PC outside the wall and then remove your goggles, smooth!
　>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1464817008176877570]: It's a very fine trick that when you stick your head out of the wall, you can see the faded real world with the texture of a low-resolution black-and-white TV. I feel a malice toward the old man who can only live in the old world.
　　Maybe this is just a thermal imaging camera....the infrared is blinking and dazzling with Hello face recognition from a Windows PC.
　>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1464819248102928389]: I was talking about surrounding a space of about 2 meters square with a virtual wall, but the great thing is that there is a "hot carpet" of about the same size. I just had to designate it as my play area.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1464875042664173573]: it was a waste of time not to beat saver with proper meta-awareness. At first I could only see the notes, then I could see the combo multiplier on the right, then I could see the combo count on the left, then I could see that the scores were flying off the notes, then I noticed the life in front of me.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1464877444427509764]: I played Easy all the way through and it was B and C, so I studied beat savers. Score 100 degrees of swing, no timing judgment, no penalty for moving too fast in a hurry, hard to notice, but the angle of the hit is narrower, so the miss rate increases, no trigger operation, so you have more freedom in how you hold the trigger.

[Vivecraft] Explaining the VR adaptation of Minecraft: amazingly immersive with the introduction of shadow mods! https://blog.endstart.net/article/vivecraft.html]
[Playing Minecraft with Oculus Quest 2 - Kotobanoutakata https://ktb.hatenablog.com/entry/2021/01/05/235329]
>Error message on black screen after Minecraft starts up.
> To be activated from the oculus screen.
> If SteamVR is up, exit it and try again.
　I don't understand why, but it looks like SteamVR needs to operate the activation from the Oculus side.

Opening the desktop in OculusLink is black.
　https://note.com/itto_/n/nc80de93162af
　This and "Designate as active OpenXR runtime" in the Oculus app.
Visible.

Today's Summary
 I launched SteamVR via OculusLink and launched Vivecraft with the connection status indicator showing -> I was able to get an immersive menu screen, I launched Micra on the VR space!
 It's a wireless connection, so it's choppy due to lack of bandwidth and I can't figure out how to start the game, one break until the cable arrives.

Shockingly, he was playing Micra on a machine with a GeForceGTX1070, but he had never used it before. w When I explicitly specified that he should use it, he said that OpenGL is not supported by the current driver and Micra would not start.

　Install the driver

		Video of him turning on the recording and coming back to find his keyboard gone and he's bewildered.

			It's back unexpectedly while I'm trying to fix the settings, and isn't the display too small? Have they changed the settings for that too?

			At least I got the job of writing my name on the presentation materials, it's still a little hard to do it all. But, well, the "future of working within VR space" is much closer now that keyboards and pointing devices are a reality. It's not an essential difference if the monitor is physically present or not.
			I actually had a mug on my desk, and when I tried to drink tea, it hit my goggles and I couldn't drink it, so I put a straw on it, but I hope I can bring that into the VR space like my keyboard.
		The monitor is bigger, but the keyboard is gone again.

			In terms of monitor resolution, well, it's enough to write a program.

>The audio is indeed audible, but since it is via Bluetooth, there is some lag. This lag was especially severe when playing games. Also, I sometimes felt some heaviness in the game, probably due to the Bluetooth earphones connected.
Wired if you want to play BeatSaber

You could put a sofa or a desk.
　The real ones are there.
