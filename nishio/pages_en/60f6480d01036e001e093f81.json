Reiterate the concept
In my [personal project], [the reader is me], so it is difficult to create a page explaining what I already know.
　When I'm visiting someone else's personal project, I don't create many new pages in the first place.
　I don't "not make it at all" in my personal projects.
　　At what kind of time do you make it?

Scrapbox including adopters was created for the first time in [Unexplored Junior 2021].
　I've created quite a page of explanations here.
　Why?

what kind of thing
　Having made so many of them, I'm starting to see common patterns.
　What's in it for you.
　　Exact name title
　　Brief description
　　External links to sources to look at if you want to know more

 　The "not getting the message" is a way of thinking that assumes information is communicated.

Why did I make it all up in the unexplored Junior Scrapbox?
　After all, "I can't get through to you.
　I think "immer" doesn't convey the same message as "I use immer" or "I like immer too".
　　If it's a push-off style, I'd say, "If you don't know a word, of course you should Google it yourself," but the atmosphere is a bit friendly.
　In some cases, the words aren't used correctly.
　　「Firebase Hosting」と「Firebase」と呼んだり
　　「Cloud Firestore」を「Firebase」と呼んだり
　　Netlify" becomes "Netfly" and so on.

Why did this suddenly climb into my thoughts?
　Perhaps when I considered machine translating the entire Scrapbox project, I felt that a lot of things just didn't "come across" in the translation.
