Scrapbox Page Improvement Case Study 2
[Scrapbox page improvement case study].

	In the page titled `Corpus Refinement`, it was written that `It is impossible to prepare a clean corpus in advance` `A system is needed to put in a corpus at random and clean it up [after the fact] `A system is needed to refine [an imperfect corpus] instead of learning from a given corpus`.
 I searched for "miscellaneous" thinking, "Where's the story about improving that messy corpus?"
 I also searched for "miscellaneous corpus."
 I finally found it by searching for "corpus".
 The word "miscellaneous" was not on this page.
 So I added `[miscellaneous corpus]` and `[miscellaneous] corpus`.

	It was a long way around, but beneficial because in the process I saw that `the more important the project, the more messy it starts,' and it reinforced my feeling that the concept of `miscellaneous' is useful.
 The `miscellaneous` is not actually a link on this page either.
 I made it a link so the two pages are now connected.

	I'll [link]([bracket]) various other things as I remember them.
 	The more repeatedly a page is read, the more linked it becomes and the better it becomes a hub of information.
