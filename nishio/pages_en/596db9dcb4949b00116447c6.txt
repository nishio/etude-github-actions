Consult an attorney.
	Lawyers are the experts when it comes to law and contracts, rely on them with respect.
 Just as we sometimes see cases in the IT field that could have been easily resolved if only we had consulted an expert earlier, so too in the legal field, cases of "if only I had consulted a lawyer earlier..." occur.
	Judging yourself based on a web article instead of consulting a lawyer when there is a legal issue involved is like a cancer patient reading a web article and refusing to accept the doctor's standard of care.
