	[Wabi and Sabi] by [digital nature] [pantheonized computer for ecosystem].

PrefaceNote 4
>After a stage of ubiquitous use in society, highly developed computers will cover the earth as a new ecosystem that integrates with nature. This vision is referred to in this book as "[counted nature]," "computational nature," or "digital nature.
 Example: In a car driving in fog, it is impossible to know the road ahead by sight. They rely on the car navigation system. The map on the car navigation system is a "countable nature.

[Coating of the senses].
	For example, as of 2021, when using a smartphone, part of the field of vision is digital, but when wearing an HMD, the entire field of vision becomes digital. This is visual covering.
	Similarly, if all five senses were coated digitally, the world that humans perceive would not be the physical world of today, but something else.
	　He describes this state of affairs as "mankind's descent into digital nature.

[Hua Yan Sutra] [Hua Yan]
	The way the world is perceived ([the legal world]) is divided into four levels.
	The general human world, the "[koto hōkai]"
	[Riho-kai]" that captures the principle (sky) behind it.
	The "world of the unhindered law," in which principles and events are freely connected.
	[jijo jijo hi-hindered ho-kai]" consisting of a direct relationship between events.
