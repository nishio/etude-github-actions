FAX
If we could work with a digital multifunction device manufacturer to create a device that "when you insert a paper document, it is scanned into kintone and can send a fax," or "when a fax arrives, it goes into kintone for now, and you can select it and send it out as paper," it would replace all the fax machines in the world. I was thinking that, but it already exists.
