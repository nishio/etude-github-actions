Redirect for SPA in Netlify
　In an application (SPA) that is made of a single index.html file, there are times when I want to pass parameters.
　If you put it in the path, it will go to a file that is not index.html.
　　I thought it was a hash or query parameter, which I could work around in the settings, but it would be too much trouble.
	With [Netlify], that configuration is just 4 lines in netlify.toml in the root of the project
code:netlify.toml
 [[redirects]]
   from = "/*"
   to = "/index.html"
   status = 200

	Someone did "write a webpack configuration to put _redirect in build..." but it's not necessary.
