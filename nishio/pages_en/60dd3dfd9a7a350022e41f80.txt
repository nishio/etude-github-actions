There was a discussion about what would happen if GPL code was included in the training data for a model that learns source code and generates source code from comments, but copyright is restricted regarding this usage in the first place.
	Well, if I were on the modeling side, I would remove from the training data any code that explicitly declares GPL, since it is not a very difficult process.
	If the code output by it happens to match the GPL code, it is not an infringement of copyright because there is no reliance.
