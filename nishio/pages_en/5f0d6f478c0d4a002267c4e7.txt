	What I thought was a dual segment tree, is probably a half delayed segment tree.

   >The implementation unintentionally assumed that the action was commutative.
   >Incorrect operation for non-replaceable "overwrite action
   >Timestamping turned it into a commutative max operation.
  This would correspond to the following
   >Two Two-Segment Segment Trees
   >When the action does not change the result even if the order of actions is changed, such as interval add and interval chmin, the action side can be processed like a normal segment tree, which is slightly faster.
   >How to do interval assignment
   >(time, value to be assigned) can be paired and chmaxed.
