Clubhouse
It's a confusing series of stories broken up into multiple walls, so I've summarized them once.

	Can the speakers overlap each other in a chorus -> not overlap well, weird [src https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10223981308457088?comment_id=10223983418149829 ]
		Audience member who heard it: "It sounded like you got it right."
		There was about 1.5 seconds of silence at the timing of the elevation from audience to speaker."
 	(incorrect guess) My guess is that the speakers have a P2P connection to each other and are mixing locally. I think the audience is receiving the delivery of the server-side mixing from the server.
 		It was weird when the speakers tried to sing in chorus with each other, but the audience heard it decently, I guess that's what I mean.
 	 I couldn't think of a way to verify this sort of thing in the field, but using time reports would be a good idea.
	I got the results of the packet capture.
		>The clubhouse server is probably located in Tokyo and does not seem to be P2P while the speaker is participating. Here is Kengo Nakajima's log [src https://facebook.com/ohkubo.kohei/posts/10158086651341476]
		code::
		 Only two places to send it to
   107.155.29.138 4005 This is over 90%.
   164.52.32.58 8913 Sometimes this mixes.
   ...
  The possibility of P2P has been clearly ruled out by the fact that there is almost only one destination for communication.

　　　I guess this is it.
   >Kengo Nakajima: like 50 80 byte packets per second, much different from zoom and others [src https://www.facebook.com/ohkubo.kohei/posts/10158086651341476?comment_id= 10158086740376476]
   You mean the red line is a proprietary UDP-based protocol?
				The small latency ensures that the servers are located in Japan, leaving the money to the major countries? Cities? The server itself may only forward UDP packets.

					Oh, and even if it's not P2P between speakers, I'm not denying anything about "the audience is receiving the stream after it's been mixed by the server with a slight delay", so I guess that's true there!
  >Tatsuya Takahashi: I checked the IP and it seems to be an IP owned by a service called Zenlayer. I think it's an access point in Tokyo. [src https://www.facebook.com/ohkubo.kohei/posts/10158086651341476?comment_id=10158086855531476]

  		Ha, I see. You're building an edge server that throws back UDP packets at high speed with this [src https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10223986141217904].
  		The one written in the small box in the above figure is called Zenlayer.

 Opinion that the server may not be doing speech synthesis.
　>I would like to use Clubhouse, which is based on E2EE and has a whiteboard.
　 Oh, that's what I want too lol.
