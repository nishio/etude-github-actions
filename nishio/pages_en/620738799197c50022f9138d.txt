Find the good in things quickly.

This is the advantage of good sense. Bees put comb in their honey, snakes put poison in their bile. The same is true of taste; some seek the good, others the bad. There is no lack of good, especially in books, in that they provide food for thought. But many have such a fragrance, that they look for a single fault among a thousand excellences, and take only that fault and condemn it, as if they were ransacking the hearts and minds of men. In this way, they lay out all the faults that credit bad taste more than their own intelligence. They lead a sad life of nourishing themselves with bitters and eating garbage. The person who, amidst a thousand and one faults, acquires a single beauty found by chance is the more fortunate hobbyist.
