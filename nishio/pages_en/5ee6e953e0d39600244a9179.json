segment tree
Given a sequence of a fixed number of values, operations can be performed on that interval in logarithmic time [data structure].
　Occurs quite frequently in AtCoder
　[Data Structures in Programming Contests https://www.slideshare.net/iwiwi/ss-3578491] [Takuya Akiba] p.33~

　Update value O(logN)
　Operation on interval O(logN)
　 For example, "sum of the interval" for addition, and "max of the interval" for max.
　 See [Delayed Propagation Segment Trees] for possible operations

It is not possible to delete elements, but there is no harm in doing so, since the sum can be updated with 0 instead of deletion, and the minimum value can be updated with a sufficiently large number.

An efficient way to find the minimum value is [heapq], but since this one is random access and updates are not straightforward, the approach is to achieve deletion by skipping over invalid values.
