Memo 2019-11-04.
	There is no such thing as meaning in writing, only the assumption that meaning exists.
	There is no need for a machine to try to understand the meaning of natural language in dealing with it. Because it doesn't exist.
	Anyone who criticizes a machine for not trying to make sense of it is just being delusional and should be ignored.
	All you have to think about is increasing your win rate in [language games] that deal with natural language.
	You don't have to win every game, just the ones that benefit you by winning.
