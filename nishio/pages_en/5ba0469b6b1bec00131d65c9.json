Is it necessary to reply?

When Mr. A says to Mr. B, "I can do it too,
　Mr. A can really do it / Mr. A just thinks he can.
　 Mr. B is producing results/not producing results
	There are two axes of

When one claims, "I can do X," it is often just "I think I can do X."
	It is a subjective interpretation, and until you actually do it and see the results, you will not know if it is true or not.
	Since Mr. A is only making a claim that lacks evidence, there is no need to take it seriously. The burden of proof is on Mr. A.

Suppose we are fairly certain that Mr. A is "able" to do so from collateral evidence and other sources.
	If, as a matter of fact, Mr. B did it first and produced results, it is only natural that Mr. A, who could have done it but did not, would not be compensated.
 There is no need to be jealous of Mr. A.

When Mr. A is ready and Mr. B has not yet produced results.
	We need to hurry up and get results. This is no time for sterile discussions.

Therefore, in all cases, this conversation is sterile and should be disengaged promptly.
