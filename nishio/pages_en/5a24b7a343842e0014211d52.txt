one's interests and actual income
 There's an expression that goes "hobby and practicality."
 The two are independent axes in the first place, since they are described as "combining" when they are combined.
 From the perspective of practical benefit, bringing up a hobbyist perspective like "I don't want to speed-read novels" when we're talking about speed-reading reference material is not a distinction.
