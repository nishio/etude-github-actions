position
The word "position," used in contexts such as "[exterminate] critics who do not take a position," is difficult to understand because it is highly abstract from a Japanese perspective.
	[GPT3.icon] "Take a position" means to articulate and advocate one's position or thinking on a topic, issue, event, or market.
　[nishio.icon]This explanation is correct, but I think many people don't get the idea of "clearly asserting your ideas to the market".

	[GPT3.icon]The term is commonly used in the business and financial world, especially in investments. An investor may take a buy or sell position in a particular stock or asset class in the market. This is done with the goal of making a profit by predicting future price increases or decreases.
	　[nishio.icon]For example, the act of "selling dollars and buying yen at a time when the yen is weak and the dollar is strong" is "clearly asserting" one's "view" that "the yen is too weak.
	　　If the idea is right, you will profit; if it is wrong, you will suffer a loss.
	　　The opinions of those who don't do that and only offer opinions have no weight, and that's why we say, "[Get rid of the critics who don't take a position].
	　　How can a person who doesn't have dollars sell dollars and buy yen positions, of course [FX]!
	　　　Deciding that "this is a situation in which FX should be played" is also a risk-taking decision.
	　　People who say things like "[you shouldn't do FX]" without taking risks are critics who don't take positions.

	[GPT3.icon]Taking a position can also clarify one's position on an event or issue. A person or group may take a position on a political or social issue. This allows them to present a particular position or way of thinking and prepare for discussion or negotiation with those involved.
