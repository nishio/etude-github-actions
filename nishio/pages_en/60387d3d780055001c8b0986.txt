Brief description.
If Mr. A says, "Explain it simply," that "simply" is subjective to Mr. A, so no matter what explanation we give, it may be judged as "not simple.
People tend to mistakenly believe that if you explain something in a way that they can understand in the past, they will understand it too, but if the observed fact is "I explain something that I could understand and Mr. A cannot understand," then the premise has been overturned.
