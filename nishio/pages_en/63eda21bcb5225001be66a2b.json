When a part of you belongs to everyone else, what is the rest of you?
When some of the things that I vaguely thought of as "[myself]" are no longer "[mine]" because they can be "done by anyone" through "commoditization" by AI, what will be left for me to do that I can say "this is me"?

Currently, the [cognitive resolution] of "self" is low, and you feel somewhat threatened because you perceive it vaguely as a whole.
　Need to clarify the concept of "self"

I first wrote under the title, "When part of what you vaguely thought was you is eaten by AI, what's left?"
　I thought this "[AI will eat you]" could be interpreted in a different way from what I wanted to express.
　but, well, I don't know a better way to describe it because it's still vague to me.
　Expression with a little more bite
　　Commoditization through AI will make it possible for anyone to do it and not "own" it.
	Cut it down because it's long: [" When part of you is eaten by an AI, what's left?"].
	I guess "a part of you belongs to everyone."
　　→ When a part of you belongs to everyone else, what is the rest of you?

Example of drawing AI
　For those who originally thought "I can't draw", "drawing" is not "part of what I thought I was", so commoditization by AI is "gaining power".
　For those who originally "can draw" (and perhaps not only "I who can draw" constituted "I"), the commoditization of "a part of what I thought was me" by AI means that "a part of me becomes everyone else's".
