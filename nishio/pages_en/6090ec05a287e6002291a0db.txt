 I'm talking about the <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20071005/1191562104'> Brainf*ck interpreter in Python (you can write that on one line)</a> from 3 years ago, but it didn't work and I left it alone. I remembered that I'd left it in, so I fixed it. Well, the code before removing whitespace is still there, and the program used for compression is still there, so the only thing I had to do is to make the code before conversion run the program specified by the command line argument, and to re-create the program to remove whitespace characters. When I had previously created a program to remove whitespace characters, I had to make a syntax tree and then put it back without whitespace, but I didn't have to do that. Easy peasy.

 *1279206313*I added tuareg-mode with port and emacsclient stopped working.
 Gugu heri. I am not good at cleaning up.

 $ emacsclient -s /tmp/emacs501/server tmp.txt

 It works. I wonder if the name of the "/tmp/emacs501/server" part has been rewritten somehow.

 $ export EMACS_SERVER_FILE=/tmp/emacs501/server
 $ emacsclient tmp.txt
 emacsclient: error accessing server file "/tmp/emacs501/server"

 Ghee.
 
 Ah, here we go.
 >||
 $ emacsclient -f /tmp/emacs501/server tmp.txt
 emacsclient: error accessing server file "/tmp/emacs501/server"

 With this behavior, is it the -s that should be done?
 
 Oh, and when I run it with that, the file name is -dir, and C-x # doesn't exit emacsclient, and I'm in a mess. What should I do?
 
 Uh-oh. Okay.

 /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient tmp.txt
 ||<
 This will work as before.

 $ which emacsclient
 /opt/local/bin/emacsclient
 $ emacsclient --version
 emacsclient 23.2
 $ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient --version
 emacsclient 22.2.50
 ||<
 This seems to be the case.
