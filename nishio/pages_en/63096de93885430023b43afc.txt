Twitter and Bullying
[https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/102/4102378/ ASCII.jp: "Twitter is the stage for cyberbullying in Japan," a survey of 10,000 people reveals cyberbullying in the world and Japan (1/2)]

[Funny statistic].
	There was an argument that the results were wrong because LINE was not included in the survey.
