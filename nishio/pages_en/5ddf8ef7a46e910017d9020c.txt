 In the 15 years between 2015 and 2030, the population of 20-somethings will decrease by 1 in 7
 A job done by seven people will be done by six in 15 years.
  The amount of work per person increased by 17%.
  A 17% increase in work for someone working 20 days x 8 hours per month would mean an additional 27 hours per month.
   Would you work at least an hour more overtime each day or would you reduce your days off by three days per month?

It is not realistic to deal with a 17% increase in workload by increasing individual work hours.
	By the way we work,
		Increases work efficiency by 17
		Reduce the work itself by 17
		Increase the workforce by 17% by putting people who are not currently working to work
	Approaches such as the following are needed
