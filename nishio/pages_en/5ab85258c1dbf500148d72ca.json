TODO: Unexplored as a Revised Network Formation System
The [Unexplored as a Network Formation System] I wrote in 2011 was difficult to read because of the constraint of only one page, and because I abbreviated "network" to NW and so on in one page because I was told to include my introduction and so on after I wrote it. So how about making a revised version here?
