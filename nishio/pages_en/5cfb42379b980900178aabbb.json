Labor Time Efficiency
>The relationship between "work style" and "wealth". As a famous thought experiment, the catch of a fisherman who works for a week is in the order of C > A > B, where A = 8 hours every day, B = target number of hours every day, and C = work a lot on days when the catch is good and rest the rest of the time. The worst is to "set a quota and work hard," while the next best is to "work a fixed number of hours. The way of working in a corporate organization is said to be unproductive to begin with.

Suppose the yield per fixed time is 1-7.
	(A) If you work 25 credit hours daily
		Harvest totals 700
		Total hours worked: 175
		Harvest efficiency per unit time is 4.0
	(b) If you work with a daily quota of 100 harvests
		Working hours for each day (rounded up to the nearest unit)
			`array([100.,  50.,  34.,  25.,  20.,  17.,  15.])`
		Total hours worked: 261
		Harvest totals 700
			No different from (A)
		Harvest efficiency per unit time is 2.68
			(A) > (B)
	(c) Work a lot when you can catch it.
		Assume in (B) that the same hours are worked on the best efficiency day because the maximum of 100 credit hours are worked
		Working hours for each day (rounded up to the nearest unit)
			`array([0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  100.])`
		Total working hours: 100
		Harvest totals 700
			(A)(B) No different from (A)(B)
		Harvest efficiency per unit time is 7.0
		 (C) > (A) > (B)
	(C2) Work a lot when you can catch it, Part 2
		Assuming the opinion, "But you can't work only at your best efficiency!"
		Work 20 credit hours daily and extend to 30 hours if you're in good shape.
			The "25 units of work" is the image of a 10-hour workday.
			The "work 20 credits and if you are in good shape, work 30 credits" is like "work 8 hours and if you are in good shape, work 4 hours of overtime".
			Good shape" is defined as "yield per unit time greater than 4." It can be verified over the course of 20 working credits.
		20 credit hour harvest
			`array([ 20,  40,  60,  80, 100, 120, 140])`
			Total 560
		Harvesting Overtime
			`array([ 0,  0,  0,  0, 50, 60, 70])`
			Total 180
		Total harvest 740
		Total working hours: 170
		Harvest efficiency is 4.35
			(C) > (C2) > (A) > (B)
	(C3) Work a lot when you can catch it, Part 3
		Try to have more variation in working hours.
			Image: "Try working two hours in the morning, and if you don't feel well, take a half day off.
			Work 5 credit hours every day, and if you're in good shape, work 25 hours.
		5 credit hour harvest
			`array([ 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35])`
			Total 140
		Harvesting an additional 20 hours on a good day
			`array([  0,   0,   0,   0, 100, 120, 140])`
			Total 360
		Total harvest 500
		Total working hours 95
		Harvest efficiency 5.26
			(C) > (C3) > (C2) > (A) > (B)

summary
	Situations where the yield per unit time fluctuates
	Yield per unit work hour depends on how you work.
		(C) > (C3) > (C2) > (A) > (B)
		(b) "Work until a certain yield is reached" is the worst.
			Because you'll be working intensively when the yield per unit of time is low.
		(a) "working a certain number of hours" is the next worst
		(c) "Concentrate work when yield per unit time is high" is the most efficient.
			However, many may question whether this is realistically possible.
		(C2) "Working overtime when I'm doing well and going home on time on a bad day" is better than (A)
		(C3) "Take a half afternoon off when you are not feeling well and work overtime when you are feeling well" is the next best thing to (C)
