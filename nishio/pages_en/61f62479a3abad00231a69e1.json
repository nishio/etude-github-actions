Mastering Excellence.

The rarity of excellence within excellence. Without excellence, you will never get greatness. The mediocre will never be applauded. Holding some office of excellence distinguishes one from the lowly crowd and puts us in the ranks of the elect. To excel in a small office is to be great in a small thing; the more comfortable, the less glorious. The highest honor in great things has the royal character of arousing admiration and winning favor.
