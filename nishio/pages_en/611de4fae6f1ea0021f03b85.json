Holes and fast horses
>[golden_lucky https://twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1427524721659179012]: I'm trying to figure out what the difference is between the argument that customers might need cars instead of [fast horses] and the argument that customers might want [holes instead of drills].

I think there are a lot of publishers or planners who have implicitly adopted this argument.

As valuable as it is to make the effort to determine in advance whether the customer wants a fast horse or an automobile, I still think it's a matter of consequence.
>[AntiBayesian https://twitter.com/AntiBayesian/status/1427526723659132932]: It's no different everywhere, for example in my tweets. I'm talking about clarifying whether you want a fast horse because you want to travel fast (if it's fast, it doesn't have to be a horse) or because you want to win a riding race (if it's faster than a horse but not a horse, it doesn't matter).
	>[AntiBayesian https://twitter.com/AntiBayesian/status/1427527424800026630]: The problem here is that if clients and agents assume that the only way to travel fast is by horse, then the only way is to breed horses. On the other hand, we know even jet planes, so we can think of something faster than horses, but can we come up with something that doesn't exist when horses are currently the best?

The latter is "customers don't know what they really need, so you have to make suggestions", which is a completely different context. twitter.com/golden_lucky/s...

	>My interpretation is that the mountain tops in the two stories are the same, but the routes are different.

I don't really see the golden_lucky distinction either, and I sympathize with AntiBayesian's "the mountain tops of the two stories are the same", but to put it in my own words...

Both of them pay attention to "things" like "holes" and "fast horses," but that's not much different than paying attention to a product, a thing.
The phrases [what the customer really needed] and [what they want] are misleading, what really matters is that the customer does not want things.
>I'm talking about clarifying whether the reason you want a fast horse is to move fast (if it's fast, it doesn't have to be a horse) or to win a riding race (if it's faster than a horse but not a horse, it doesn't matter).
Neither "I want to move fast" nor "I want to win races" are things. The thought of implicitly limiting the term to "things" is narrow-mindedness.
