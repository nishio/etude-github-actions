ambiguous
[Natural language] is often ambiguous, what can we do about it?
There have been several attempts to re-express the language in a strictly artificial language, but I don't think they have worked.

When something is described in a strict symbol system, knowledge about the symbol system must be transferred for humans to read and interpret it, but most individuals cannot do this because humans are clumsy. Even for those that can, it requires a costly investment. How do we know if that investment is worth it?

The approach of trying to convert a knowledge system designed for human readers into a machine-readable form is a problem when something appears that cannot be expressed in the machine-readable symbol system used. You realize the ambiguity of the original description and cannot reach a consensus on how it should be expressed (I think it is correct not to try to reach one on this. [correct and futile], [common sense knowledge])

To summarize these two points, "do not expect humans to read and understand" and "do not try to directly translate what humans are currently reading" (this is true for English-to-Japanese translations as well, where the priority is not to preserve the content of the original text but to read it properly in the target language). (This is also true for English-to-Japanese translations. The priority is to be readable in the target language rather than to preserve the content of the original text.

In addition, some value must be created.

There are ambiguities in human natural language that could benefit from being resolved. It would be nice to be able to detect them mechanically.
Not "detect what is ambiguous." Almost everything is ambiguous.
