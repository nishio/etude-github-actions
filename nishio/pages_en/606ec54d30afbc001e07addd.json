âœ…Make proposal support mode
Old title: ðŸ¤”Value Hypothesis Sheet Questionnaire
Consider making [value hypothesis sheet] a [template chatbot

First we need to formulate the question.
The original sheet implicitly assumes software, but it's a bad bias to limit the way the issue is solved to being a function of software.
There are four blank spaces on the original sheet, but the lines are pretty empty, so I feel like I should fill them in a bit more if I'm going to ask a question.

ver0
	>(User) ________ is
 > (desire) ________ (do) but
 >(Assignment) ________ (not) so
 >(Product features)________(thing) worthwhile.

ver1
	>Who are your customers?
ã€€>What would that person like to see happen?
ã€€>What needs to happen for that to happen?
ã€€>What challenges are there out there?
ã€€>Which ones will solve that challenge?

ver2
	>Who are your customers?
 >What would that person like to see happen?
 >What needs to happen for that to happen?
 >How can I do that?
 > >Can you do it?
ã€€They cut out the word "issues."

ver3
	>What kind of person is it for?
 > What would that person like to see happen?
 > What needs to happen for that to happen?
 > How can I do that?
 > > You can do it, but you have to be careful not to > make it too difficult for them to find the right place.
ã€€The word "customer" has been deleted.

The "Again" command
	Repeat several times

ver4
ã€€There are two paths: "things" and "events."
  >How can I do that?
  ã€€This is a "what would be the right thing to do?" is sometimes appropriate.
  >What needs to happen for that to happen?
  ã€€This is another one of those "what do you need?" could be.
 > >Can you do it?
 ã€€It's not appropriate that this is the last question I have for you.
 ã€€Tends to lead to "yes or no" answers, which are not appropriate questions when you move into in-depth mode immediately afterwards
 ã€€What can you do to make that happen?" is better.

ver5
	There are two ways to say "thing" and "phenomenon."

	It's based on a value hypothesis sheet, but it's not really a value hypothesis bot.
		Maybe "support for proposals to create."

ver6
	[The first question should be made with the expectation that it will go in the title of the log].
		>"This mode supports proposals to make. What kind of things are you thinking of making?"
