 *1215528825* Is it called a summer cold?
 I went to bed because I felt woozy when I was awake and woke up at this hour. My face is burning. I feel a little cold. My throat is burning. My eyes are sticky, so I put some eye drops in them. Mnh-mnh.
 
 I don't know what to do. In the meantime, I guess I'll go have a meal before I get sleepy again.

 but I had no way to get fresh green onions late at night, so I went to Sukiya and had a bowl of negi tama buta donburi (pork bowl with green onion and egg). Super comforting.
