> Until now: come up with an idea → high cost to start → most disappear without starting
> Lately: come up with an idea -> throw it into ChatGPT -> partially done -> feel it's a waste to throw it away -> tons of work-in-progress tasks
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639497265315483651] Pulled by the machine, the result is that the force is concentrated in the "weak areas" that "get confused when multiple projects are in parallel" and breaks from there.

> Create a list of work-in-progress projects so that they can be easily pasted into GPT4.
> When in doubt about "what to do now," consult GPT4 and follow its instructions.
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639503269335830528] Well, I have a clear task that needs to be done with the highest priority, so I'll do it when I get home.

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1639508300701245441] Excited to announce that I'll be using this account more actively to reach a wider audience!  As much as I enjoy posting in Japanese, I've been exploring the possibilities of #GPT4 and want to share my thoughts in English as well. Stay tuned for more updates!
	>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1639508411623833602] Recently, I've been using #GPT4 and am impressed by its potential. However, I've also noticed a drop in performance when using it in Japanese. Hoping to bridge the gap and engage with the English-speaking community more!

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1639509453090476033] Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed, and now I understood.
> 
> Before: Come up with an idea → High initiation cost → Most ideas fade without action
> Now: Come up with an idea → Throw it to ChatGPT → Partially completed → Feels wasteful to discard → Tasks pile up
 >[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1639511335510867969] When a machine stretches a chain, the force concentrates on the weakest link, causing it to break. ChatGPT stretches me, and my weak point of handling multiple projects in parallel has led to confusion.
 >[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1639511394130472963] Possible Solution:
 > 
 > 1: Create a list of ongoing projects and make it easy for GPT4 to access.
 > 2: Whenever in doubt about "what to do now," consult GPT4 and follow its guidance.
 > 
 > A great way to balance efficiency and work management!

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639508755779063808] I have been using GPT4 recently and am impressed with its future potential. However, I am also aware that its performance is degraded when used in Japanese. Therefore, I would like to expand the scope of information sharing by increasing activities in English-speaking countries. #language barrier #technology
