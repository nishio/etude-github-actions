A good social trigger is a bone stuck in the throat.
I really imagined [acupuncture needles], but it's too hard to convey, even if it's a good idea.

Painful, not instantly fatal, and its presence is recalled by everyday activities such as spitting

Not chronic, not too painful, but good to keep reminding you of its existence for a while and stimulate your thoughts continuously [social trigger].

A bone stuck in the throat is a subtle metaphor because it has no productive effect.
[Acupuncture is similar in that sense because it gives the effect of acupuncture continuously, but it doesn't actually hurt, so it doesn't match the "bringing awareness" part of it.
ã€€After all, something that hurts a little is appropriate.
