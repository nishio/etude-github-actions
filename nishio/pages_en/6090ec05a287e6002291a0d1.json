 - Admitting the choice axiom, the real numbers are vector spaces on an infinite dimensional rational number body
 -- Take one, take all the yuan you can get by linear combination, take from the remaining ones, and repeat.
 -- <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%84%E3%82%A9%E3%83%AB%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E8%A3%9C%E9%A1%8C'>Zorn's supplement - Wikipedia</a>
 -- If we assume that the maximal source is not the whole real number, we can show that we can take the whole real number, because we still have the source, so we can go one step further with it and contradict the fact that it was maximal in the first place.
 - This shows that there exists f other than f = a x + b such that f(x) + (y) = f(x + y)

 being talked about
 - "Admitting the choice axiom, the real numbers are vector spaces on an infinite dimensional rational number body."
 -- vector space regardless of the selection axioms, and the selection axioms are necessary to show that a basis exists
 - "There exists more than just f = a x + b."
 -- not wrong, but since f(0) = 0 follows from f(0 + 0) = f(0) + f(0), b is 0
 - "Take one, take all the yuan you can get by linear combination, take from the remaining ones, and repeat."
 -- This representation may be misunderstood as if the number of bases were countably infinite. The exact expression is not like this.
 - As for your comment "Oh, I confused the basis with the orthogonal basis" about the fact that I thought I could construct f constructively but couldn't, this is like me trying to turn onto a road in a 4-ton truck and saying "Oh, this road was not accessible by a 4-ton truck" but the road was not accessible by a 4-wheeled vehicle in the first place, It's like that. The image of "basis" in my brain was an orthogonal basis, so the one-vector component of the basis {1, √2, ....} is determined independently of whether the basis is constructed constructively or not, but in fact, for example, √3 is {1, √2, √3, ...} would be {0, 0, 1, ...} but if it is {1, √2, √3-1, ...} would be {1, 0, 1, ...}. Therefore, the components of the unidirectional vector cannot be determined unless all the bases are determined. And since there are infinitely many uncountable bases, this is absurd.
 - By the way, π, π^2, π^3, ... are distinct bases since π is a transcendental number.
 
 **1277902485* Today's Deal of the Day
 Yesterday, when I came home with my MacBook and tried to start it up, it wouldn't work, so I turned it off and shook it and managed to get it to work. I decided to buy a hard disk.
 
 Yodobashi sells <del>1GB</del> 1TB Buffalo disks for 10,000 yen, but Amazon sells them for 8,882 yen with slightly different model numbers, such as HD-CY, HD-CL, and HD-CB. I can't tell the difference between HD-CY, HD-CL, HD-CB, and so on.

 Also, I was thinking about buying a fan for myself because it was so hot in the lab, and when I looked at a ranking of quiet fans, I found one like this on sale for a little over 2,000 yen, so I decided to buy this one as well.

 I will also receive a cool towel on 7/3 so I can fight this summer with it!

 <body>I couldn't help but to poke my head in and wonder how much of a rip-off price 1GB is at 10,000. <br>But 1TB is 10,000 even for an external device...</body>.

 <body>You can have R be a vector space over Q without the selection axiom. <br>And, the way you increase one by one, you only get a finite collection of sets, so even if there is a maximal principal, it will only be a finite set. </body>
