Structured chaos
A method of alternating between outlandish ideas and logical thinking in order to achieve a 50:50 ratio
>The key to such flexible thinking is what we call "structured chaos"....
> Structure and chaos are 50:50...
> When I think my thinking has turned up an outlandish idea, the next step is to use that idea as a starting point to construct an oral logic. Conversely, from a logic idea, try to recall an extreme idea...

After hearing this story, Nishio felt the process was similar to the diagram above
　Think of outlandish ideas by removing the constraints of feasibility.
　So, after coming up with an idea, I get a logical tweak that says, "That's not feasible, is it?
　Then a logical breakdown of the "goodness" of the outlandish idea
　By breaking down attributes, a myriad of solutions are created by the combination of those attributes
　Select the feasible ones among them.
