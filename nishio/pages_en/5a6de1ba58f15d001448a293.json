	I bought it because I thought the title was very relevant to what I call "knowledge trading strategies to enhance one's knowledge accumulation by belonging to multiple organizations and mediating the distribution of information" #ParallelCareer
 Today I read this book, and from the title I thought it might be relevant to something I've been working on recently, and it was as I expected. It is a survey of the type of learning that is fostered by moving back and forth across organizational boundaries. It looks like a good way to organize the relationship with peripheral concepts such as communities of practice and gatekeepers.
  In my mind, "[community of practice]" is a term I encountered in the context of [design thinking], "[gatekeeper]" in the context of [organizational knowledge acquisition], and "[legitimate peripheral participation]" in the context of the history of changing concepts about [learning], and they are not firmly connected. It would be great if these concepts are connected through this book.
