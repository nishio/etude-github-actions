 *1260196022*Memo on how to suck out iPhone SMS
 Reprinted from Twitter
 
 Trigger:.
 >>
 nishio iPhone SMS is in chat format, which is convenient for sloppy conversations, but it's a hassle to search for it when you think "what was that? If there is a way to store them in text format on my Mac, I can just search for them, but I'm not sure if there is a better way.
 nishio Hmmm, I know that my iPhone backup by iTunes is in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/, but I'm not sure how to get just the SMS data out of there. I don't understand.
 nishio What I want to do is to backup my iPhone SMS conversations in text format so that I can search and find the desired content when I want to.

 So I go to ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/***/3d0d7e.... .mddata as a binary plist and try to restore it with plutil. However, I get an error message saying that it cannot be restored correctly.

 This file is a SQLite file, so sqlite3 -csv -separator ',' 3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28.mddata "select * from message;" > output.csv to CSV You can convert it to CSV with output.csv.

 Oh, I heard that the latest iTunes uses sqlite instead of binary plist. I tried the code written in the article and got csv easily. That's great.
 
 Unfortunately, though, it doesn't display photos, videos, or emoticons. The emoticons are assigned the appropriate code, so you can just replace them, but I don't know where the image reference is written. Perhaps it is recorded somewhere other than the MASSAGE table.
