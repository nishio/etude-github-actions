Make the display meaningful when zoomed out
The display must make sense when zoomed out
	The display is meaningless if all you can see is "Wow, there's a lot of stickies.
 Set a lower limit for font size and hide text that is smaller than the limit, judging that it is not human-readable.
 Use the large display space created by this to zoom in on advanced sticky titles such as nameplates
 	The image is that of SimCity, where place names, etc. are displayed when the entire map is displayed.
