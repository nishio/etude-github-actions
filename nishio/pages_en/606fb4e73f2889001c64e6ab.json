Visualization of disadvantage is disadvantage
Visualization of disadvantage is disadvantage
[Is it beneficial to make the absurd visible?"]

I understood it as a phenomenon in which an action taken to visualize the disadvantage of a vulnerable person was interpreted as an action that disadvantages another vulnerable person.
I was trying to figure out why the strategy of visualization didn't work, but I thought it was because I visualized something else at the same time.
