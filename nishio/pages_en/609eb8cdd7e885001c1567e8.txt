Positive integers less than 1 are greater than 1
This proposition is true, but 40% of people get it wrong.

This survey was so interesting that I did a little twisted survey myself.

　I was so taken aback by the number of "it doesn't make sense" that I asked an additional question.

　One more question

explanation
　The top of all surveys is correct.
　logic
 　1: If P is false, then "if P then Q" is true regardless of the truth of Q
  2: P = "x is less than 1" is false for any positive integer x
  3: Thus "Q if P" is true for any positive integer x.
   If Q = "x is greater than 1", it would be a questionnaire question text.
　Since the majority of the correct answers are "If 3 is even, then 4 is odd" at the end, many people understand 1: "If P is false, then Q is true regardless of the truth of Q.
　It seems some people have judged "If x is less than 1, then x is greater than 1" to be "mathematically incorrect" or "a contradictory statement" based solely on this point.
　　This is a mistake.
		For example, whether "1/(1/x)=x" is correct or not cannot be determined until x is specified as the source of any set.
			If it is a positive real number, it is correct because it does not contain zero, and if it is a whole real number, it is incorrect because it contains zero.
		Similarly, we can't just look here to determine if "if x is less than 1, then x is greater than 1" is correct
		　Those who made the decision prematurely must have implicitly assumed that x was a real number, etc., and made the decision.
