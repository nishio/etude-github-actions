>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1561619927215517696 @nishio]: Yesterday and the day before yesterday I was at Kinki University for the midterm camp of Unexplored Junior. The eSports facility was amazing, but I couldn't get a good picture of it because they were in the middle of an event.

I have a feeling that this university is amazing. I feel that they are making things like "you don't have to go to the university to take liberal arts classes because you can learn on demand" a reality.

I've heard that the mobile version of Scrapbox is very good, better than using Porter, so I'm trying to use it from my iPhone in my browser (Safari)
　I don't know how to do Ctrl+T.
　The page menu has been hidden for a while now, and I thought it was because I was using Porter even though mobile support has progressed, but it usually happens in native browsers as well.
　　I think I've removed the suspicious looking UserCSS, but I need to sit down and investigate again!
　　This hidden menu, how it is hidden, has a hit point (a page that was not intended to be duplicated has been duplicated).
　　 I'm afraid of inadvertently doing something strange, so when the page menu appears, carefully tap the area where the menu seems to be and close it.
