 This time, I joined from the bath because I suddenly felt like doing it, whatever I was thinking. I just want to say "bath glamour.
 
 My eyes have been somewhat out of whack since midday, but I just touched them and found that my tonsils are swollen quite profusely. Oops. I guess I slept with the windows open last night. The temperature is low, so I have to be on my guard.

 It was too bad, even if it was self-inflicted. The problem with participating in programming contests in the bathtub is that
 - I can't concentrate.
 - The water got cold on the way.
 - There's no paper.
 
 After all, when I finished solving the 250-point problem, I had 30 minutes left. I looked at the 500-point problem and thought that I could solve this problem if I had the usual amount of time, but I couldn't concentrate and couldn't solve it, so I only got a little over 100 points for the 250-point problem. Aaaaah. I'm sure it will go down quite a bit. If I had worked diligently at my desk, I might have been able to go up, but I don't know what I'm doing.
