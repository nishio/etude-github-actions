		Reverse pattern
			I don't think they know what I know.
			I think I can fool you with [lies].
			I don't think anyone understands how I feel.
	[Identification of others].
		Different Mr. X and Mr. Y feel identical.
		I think what I have told Mr. X has been conveyed to Mr. Y.
		concrete example
			One man X made a motion to a woman close to him, A, and the other women, B, C, and I know that he also made a motion to woman B, which was also shared with all of us, which significantly lowered his favorability among the women.
				I am observing that, but I don't know only male X.
				So man X thought, "What I said to Mr. A will never be conveyed to Mr. B."
				On the other hand, I have observed something similar to this multiple times, so I generally believe that "what I tell Mr. A is also conveyed to Mr. B" and "there are information sharing channels for people other than me that I am unaware of" is True.
