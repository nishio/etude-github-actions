 *1242353042*[ja] Re: Questionnaire on how to call a closed mouth gargle
 >>
 How do you rinse your mouth with water, close it, and rinse by quickly alternating between puffing up your cheeks and putting them back together?

 What is this? There is no proper Japanese here.
 
 Well, I guess there are some fluctuations in the usage of words, but my definition of "gargle" is "to rasp one's throat," and the English word "gargle" is of course "gargle" because of the rasping action. I feel uncomfortable calling the act of simply rinsing the mouth a "gargle.
 
 So, for my part, I would have pressed "rinse mouth" and "rinse mouth" if they had been available. Oh well.

 *1242356862*"Girls Ranch" is closed.
 After all, there were many problems with the naming of the "Girl's Farm," and we received criticism from several quarters.
 
 Therefore, we changed the name to "Matrix Ranch" because we thought that being a "girl" was not important and that the key to this service would be the co-editing of the matrix.
 
 
 Also, sorry, there was a bug that "if you don't have Firebug installed, the position is not recorded after dragging", so I fixed it. This is the cause of the "vertices that should have been moved are stuck in one place" phenomenon. This has been fixed, so it should be OK this time.

 If the name is changed to "New Type Influenza," the Gundam generation will be more aware of the danger and will work harder to defend themselves!
 
 *1242359767*[gae]Matrix ranch load
 <img src="http://gyazo.com/a024e954a84adc9093f715d6dda5e19a.png">
 That's eating up 4% for a service that's not much - Matrix:Item is 1:n and Item:Position is 1:m, so it takes O(mn) queries to display one matrix. I guess that's the problem.
 
 I guess I could just cache the average of the Position...I guess I could just plug it into memcached as "Item.id -> Position".
 
 Well, let's do it when the load exceeds 20%. Latency Evaluation. It's hard to tell if speeding up the system with no clear indication that it's heavy has been effective in speeding up the system.

 *1242378506*How to brainstorm at Matrix Ranch (draft)
 http://b.hatena.ne.jp/entry/http://nishiotools.appspot.com/matrixfarm/
 >>
 id:fm315 Interesting! I think I could do a breast or something.

 I thought of an interesting brainstorming idea when I saw the opinion "I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'll write about it.
 
 - 1: Decide on a subject and create a matrix
 - 2: Tell participants the URL
 - 3: Add items that you associate with the theme for a period of time (e.g., 5 minutes). Do not worry about the correctness of the position of the items, but just place them in an appropriate manner so that they do not overlap.
 - 4: After the addition phase is complete, go through the <strong>without reloading the browser</strong> items at intervals of time (e.g., 5 minutes), placing them where you think they are appropriate in the matrix.
 -- Take advantage of the fact that items stay "where you placed them" until you reload your browser, so you can't see how others are placing them.
 - 5: At the end of the movement phase, everyone reloads. When you do this, some items stay where you imagined they would, while others move significantly. I don't know who moved where, but the position shown at this point is a fair position "taking an average of everyone's opinions". I'm definitely going to want to say a lot of things (e.g., "Well, why is x here?"), so it's a good opportunity for discussion.
 
 *1242389180*Medium Limit Online 2.0 design Today's Version
 We have only a few days left today.
 
 - Stop including api to view in a browser with html.
 - api is organized under /api/.
 - Not using HTTP status codes to communicate API results RATIONALE: I heard that some JS clients are having a hard time because Twitter's API returns Not Authrized
 - The value that can be obtained by calculation is not sent A
 - Prepare a simple format A
 - RATIONALE A: Client implementations may be in a wide variety of languages, and we do not know if there is a mature implementation of a JSON parser or if it is easy to use. So if it doesn't have to be JSON, we should provide a non-JSON format.
 - Provide a simple authentication method RATIONALE: This also has a wide variety of implementation languages.
 -- Actually, it's just a matter of sending a secret API Key with the request. No money is involved, and that should be enough.
 
 What you need
 - ■Human login
 - /home for humans
 -- ■ Must be able to create Player for AI (/home/create_player)
 --- ■Create and modify (contents of views)
 -- ■ Name change
 -- ■ Select and edit the Player (rename, etc.?)
 
 - /user/nishio
 -- My attention has been diverted elsewhere here. I want to be able to access /user/nishio, but I don't want to "make the user enter a unique unix name when creating an account". So, I want to use /user/(?P<user_id>. *If it does not exist, it searches if it is a unix name. You can set the unix name in /home, and if it is not unique, you should get an error.
 --- But anyway, that's not a priority, so that's okay.
 -- Information about the person for the general public
 --- ■Player list for now
 -- Grades and other information here (because it's information that can be made public) -> I'm holding off on displaying grades because I don't have them in the first place yet.
 
 - user? player?
 -- player I'm not sure I need it yet. I have a feeling that I don't need it yet, so I'll make it when I need it.
 
 - Game viewing page for humans
 - Human Play Page
 -- I can see the game's information in /game/(game_id), and when I do some operation, I can access /api/html/... /game/(game_id), and when you do something, the api should return a redirect to /game/(game_id). So the next thing we should make is /game/(game_id).
 
 I'm getting very sleepy now, so we'll continue tomorrow.
 
 *1242389324*I thought I POSTed, but for some reason I got a data not found error, and when I looked closer, I saw that the data was messed up in the URL.
 In short, I just wrote "mothod" for METHOD!

 The magnetic force is quite weak. It seems difficult to keep it in a stick-like posture like the original. Also, there is a grating sound, which may be a problem with the processing accuracy. Apart from the price, the original version is by far better. Cheaper or worse. Well, the original costs 110 yen per bar, so the fact that you can make icosahedrons for 300 yen, well, I'll probably just make icosahedrons and throw them away...

 But these curved sticks are nice...five sticks come with five balls. I don't need the balls.
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20090515220751j:image
 
 Classification fun. There is a large surplus of balls. We are looking for interesting games using balls.

 I'm already halfway through May. And when May is over, it becomes "I'm already halfway through this year..." I'll be 28 in July, and when I turn 30, I think I'll say, "I'm already past the halfway point to my 60th birthday.

 <I registered yesterday or the day before yesterday because <a href='http://www.artcba.com/'>I was told that I could receive a free art catalog if I registered as a member at CBA Gallery Inc. The catalog arrived promptly. It was a large size book with about 100 pages in color.
 
 It is interesting to see things. I got to know Victor Vasarely. I like this kind of thing. <a href='http://images.google.co.jp/images?q=%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%82%B6%E3 %83%AB%E3%83%AA&lr=lang_en&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en- JP- mac:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N& hl=en&tab=wi'>Vasarely - Google Image Search</a>
 
 Some paintings I have seen. There is Klimt's Kiss, for example, for 15,000 yen and up, and I thought, "What? What does that mean? What does it mean when it says "silkscreen/estamp? I searched for the word "estamp" and found out that it means a print made from an original picture. I see.

 I was wondering why Mikhail Shmirkin's lithographs are not popular, as they are priced at 1,000 yen and up. I don't dislike this kind of mysterious view of the world. I don't like this kind of mysterious world, but not enough to buy and display them. It's creepy and w <a href='http://images.google.co.jp/images?hl=en&lr=lang_ja&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aja-JP-mac%3Aofficial& hs=Wt0&um=1&sa=1&q=Chemiakin+untitled&btnG=Search+Images&aq=f&oq='>Chemiakin untitled - Google Image Search</a>
 
 It is not only two-dimensional. From a tea bowl that looks like a tea bowl to a mysterious three-dimensional shape that I don't know how to describe. It is very interesting. It shows that there are all kinds of works of art in the world.
 
 Even if you don't go to a museum, you can look at various paintings in the comfort of your own home and buy them when you feel like it. This is one aspect of art.
