circle
Circle C consists of the following: (1)
	Subject [kind] ob(C)
	The kind of [shot] between the subject hom(C)
		Each projection f ∈ hom(C) is accompanied by an object a ∈ ob(C), called the starting region, and an object b ∈ ob(C), called the ending region, and we say that "f is the projection from a to b" and write f: a → b.
	The class of the projection from a to b (hom-class; hom class) hom(a, b) is the class formed by the whole projection from a to b.

Then, for any three objects a, b, c ∈ ob(C), there exists a binary operation hom(a, b) × hom(b, c) → hom(a, c); (f, g) ↦ g ∘ f called the composition of arrays, satisfying the following axioms: .
	If the coupling laws: f: a → b, g: b → c, h: c → d then h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f holds.
	Unit rule: for each object x ∈ ob(C)
		There exists a self-projection [$ id_x = 1_x: x → x] called the identity projection of x,
		For any arrays f: a → x and g: x → b, [$ 1_x ∘ f = f] and [$ g ∘ 1_x = g].
