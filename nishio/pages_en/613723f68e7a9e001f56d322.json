	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1434495921086107655]: Wouldn't it be interesting to have a "task kozane" that gets bigger as the deadline gets closer? I thought about it, but as I was taking a walk, I realized that it would be a mistake to try to procrastinate until just before the deadline in the first place, so it was rejected.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1434499391876841474]: With the exception of the type of task that decreases when left alone, there should be a disadvantage for a normal task to have "N days left" become "N-1 days left". And yet, the reason we try to manage by deadlines is because we subconsciously think we "hate" the task and want to procrastinate by avoiding thinking about it.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1434501863341056005]: the task I tried to procrastinate is editing the video, but the assumption is that I should just download it from Zoom and cut the front and back. So why am I trying to procrastinate? "It's not interesting because it seems like an easy task", "Well, how do I use Premiere?", "I don't want to edit my own talking video", "I don't want to edit my own talking video".
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1434502386047803399]: all I'm saying is that procrastinating on everything doesn't improve it. And "you say download and edit, but what if the cloud storage has an expiration date and it's gone?" And if you think about removing uncertainty, you should at least do the download today.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1434511029099139083]: downloaded it, thank goodness!
I'll do this.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1435154909763018758]: editing work for the lecture video, first of all, how to load the material video... I did the heavy lifting from the beginning... but it took 1 pomodoro. I finished it and I'm writing it out (I still don't know if it's done or not?)
	>I not only cut off the back and forth, but I also cut off the Slido practice in the middle, and replaced it with a ticker and sound effects.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1435155290752643077]: the lecture itself was just about an hour.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1435178505029885955]: I had to stop in the middle of my lecture due to a problem, and I had to cut it down and re-output it...
	>Let's not worry about the detailed rephrasing because it would take too much time to start grinding it out.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1435188155863367684]: I'm going to call it a day because I'm feeling fuzzy-headed and dull. I'll probably be able to re-take the screenshots during the gap between meetings on Friday.

Keicho screenshot redo, what exactly?
　the impression given by a painting or image
　　Surprisingly, not many.
　　Change the title from Keicho to Keichobot?
　　Ah, so the URL is keicho.
　　　What to do about this?
　　Make the default icon in Scrapbox mode include the project
　No heavy lifting, so we'll do it in the Friday gap.
