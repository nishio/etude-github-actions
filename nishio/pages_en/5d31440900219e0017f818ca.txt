	No requirement that the objective function be differentiable
		NN is a bundle of differentiable functions
	Interpret genetic algorithms as updating probability distributions

	The general gradient method differentiates the objective function f on X-space and updates it using the gradient
	Objective function is not differentiable
	Let's make a differentiable objective function g on the parameter interval
