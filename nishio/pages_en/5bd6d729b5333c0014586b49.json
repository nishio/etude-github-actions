To be able to change the highlight color.
Changed GameObject highligher that MakeSlide object had to public static
 Not very good manners.
 This instance will remain a singleton in the future, so if so, the class object may have a value
 I mean, the member variable to_highlight is already public static.
	Should I use [message passing] in Unity's manner?

	No, if it is known that an instance of a particular class is a singleton.
 >var slides = GameObject.FindObjectOfType<MakeSlides>().slides;
 Is this what you want?

	But if there are multiple instances, they will be compiled without any problem, so wouldn't it be safer to have them in a class object, which in principle can only be one?
