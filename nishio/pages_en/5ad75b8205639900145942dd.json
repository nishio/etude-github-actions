Recruitment Will Can Must
The method of thinking in terms of the three Venn diagrams of "can, want to, and should" is often mentioned as being used by Recruit, but Recruit's Will Can Must is quite different from what is generally imagined by the words "can, want to, and should" ([Will/Can/Must]).
	Can is not "what you can do now" but "what you need to be able to do in order to achieve what you want."
	Must is not "what someone told me to do" but "what I need to do for Can."
 In other words, [breakdown] of what you want to do (Will) into actions.

[RECRUIT].
>Employees fill out a "Will Can Must Sheet" semi-annually. This is,
	>What he/she wants to achieve (Will),
 > Strengths you want to exploit and challenges you want to overcome (Can),
 > Mission Must lead to capacity building
> This is a goal management sheet consisting of the following items. Each employee clarifies what he or she wants to achieve through work (Will), discusses it with his or her superior, confirms what he or she can do to achieve it and what he or she needs to be able to do (Can), and then considers what he or she should do (Must) in this cycle every six months.
