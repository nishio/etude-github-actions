Writing to Give Up
[Shinta Nakayama] said at the reception at [CUMOT2018].
It's an interesting phrase and makes a lot of sense to me, but the listeners were surprised, so it would be beneficial to get it straightened out.

My own interpretation
	Having an idea without making it public makes it feel important.
	If you don't take action, you'll be holding on to that idea forever.
		But I'm busy with a lot of things and don't act on them = low priority in my mind.
	If there is no response from the public, they can give up on the idea.
	If there is a response from the public, you can act with confidence = higher priority for you.
