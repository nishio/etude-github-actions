consideration
ã€€Keichobot determines that frequent words are of interest to the user, while ChatGPT basically repeats the keywords in the input and falls back on one topic
ã€€ã€€This is a mistake that, well, people who use Keichobot often make, so it's no wonder ChatGPT can't do it.
ã€€ã€€Keichobot, in normal use, "asks questions about keywords in human-entered text", so a normal human would not say "I don't know about that".
ã€€ã€€ã€€This was not a good beginning for this experiment.
ã€€ã€€ã€€I should have let ChatGPT speak first.
ã€€ChatGPT repeats the same answer in plain sight.
ã€€ã€€Normal people do not repeat exactly the same answers, so they seek different expressions or speak in summary of what they wrote earlier.
ã€€ã€€The change in its wording organizes the idea.
ã€€ã€€Keichobot is not compatible with ChatGPT, which repeats the same thing over and over again, because Keichobot guesses what people are focusing on by repeating only important words.
ã€€Keichobot is guiding people to notice actionable next actions by digging into "What do you think?", "What do you want to happen?", and "What can you do to achieve this?".
ã€€ã€€However, since the "desire to do it" does not exist in ChatGPT, trying to bring it out is like pushing an arm around a brick wall.
