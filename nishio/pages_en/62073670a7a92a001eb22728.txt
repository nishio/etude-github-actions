Don't wait until the sun sets.

A wise man has a saying, "Leave things before they leave you." Just as the sun, even when it is shining brightest, often hides behind clouds lest it be seen to be setting and doubted whether it has or has not, so one should be able to seize victory in the end. Wisely withdraw from the opportunity for disaster, lest reality compel you to do so. A wise trainer will send his racer out to mow the grass before he falls on the track and is ridiculed. A beautiful woman should break the mirror early, lest she do so later with her eyes wide open.
