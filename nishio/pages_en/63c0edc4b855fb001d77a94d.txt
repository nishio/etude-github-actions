go with the times
[wave metaphor].
[Surfing]
When the wave comes, you have to ride it at the right time.
　You can forgo the ride.
　But you can't ride a wave you didn't ride later.
　　There's nothing you can do but say afterwards, "I should have ridden it."
　Tight decision-making grace period
　　There are aspects where the disadvantages of postponing a decision are significant.
　　You must decide quickly whether to get in or not and have no regrets either way.

The waves come again and again.
　Good waves may be rare, but the waves themselves come again and again.
　You can't just ride the best waves well without experiencing riding waves.
