 *1233000766* Japanese translation of the explanation in English for the mid-term limit.
 I have a feeling that a Japanese translation of <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20081114/1226628815'>the explanation</a> in English of the most middle limit would be a concise and coherent explanation, so I'll translate it. What a match pump.
 
 What is the **Maximum Limit?
 Saichichugen (neither minimum nor maximum) is a card game for three players. It uses 52 playing cards, minus jokers. The concept of "median" is very important in the rules of Saichuugen. In this game, "median" means "the value that is greater than or equal to one of the three values and less than or equal to the other. The goal of the most-median is to have the final score be the median; one game consists of five rounds, and one round consists of three turns (tricks). The winner of a round or trick is also determined using the median.
 
 ** Rules
 *** Card distribution
 Shuffle the playing cards and deal 17 cards to each of the three players. The last card left over is not used. It is kept face down and not shown to anyone.
 
 *** Turn (Trick)
 Each player puts one card face down on the field. When they are all face down, they open them at the same time. The strongest card, not the weakest card, but the most ordinary card wins the turn. The strength of a card is determined by its number and suit: 1 is the weakest and King is the strongest. (J, Q, and K are considered to be 11, 12, and 13, respectively.) If there are cards with the same number, the suit determines the winner. Spades are strongest, followed by hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Whoever wins a turn gets a temporary score equal to the number of the winning card. To represent this, the winning card is kept face up and the losing card is turned face down.
 
 *** Round
 The trick is repeated three times. Then calculate the score you got in this round (round score). You should take the total of the cards left face up that you have played this round. If all cards are face down, your round score is zero. If only one 7 is face up, your round score is 7. If two cards, a 5 and a 7, are face down, your round score is 12. The player with the median round score is the winner of this round. Only the winner of the round gets the score from this round. The losing player turns face down all the face up cards from this round.
 
 One point: By definition, if there is a tie for the median, they are the median. If there is more than one median score, then everyone is the winner of the round. For example, if only one person scores a round, the median is 0, so the winner gets 0 points. Of course, the loser also gets 0 points. As a result, no one gets a point.
 
 *** Games
 After the cards are dealt, the game ends after five rounds. The winner is the person with the median final score.

 I found a few things I wanted to fix after doing the Japanese translation, so I'll try again.
 
 **What is Saichugen?
 Saichugen (most limited; 'most mediocre' in English) is a card game for three players. It uses a deck of playing cards without jokers. It uses a deck of playing cards without jokers. Its rule characterized by the concept of median; the value which is equal or more than another value and equal or less than the other value. There are 5 rounds in 1 game and 3 turns(tricks) in 1 round. Winner of a round and a trick is also determined in a median fashion.
 
 **Rule
 *** Dealing
 Shuffle a deck and deal 17 cards for 3 players. The last card of deck is not used in the game. Make its face down.
 
 *** Turn(Trick)
 Each player plays a card face down, and then opens it in same time. The most 'mediocre' card win the trick, neither the strongest nor the weakest. Aces are most weakest cards and kings are most strongest one. (Consider A, J, Q, K as 1, 11, 12, 13)  In case there are cards of same number the suits of the cards are considered. Spades are strongest. "Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clovers" strongest to weakest. The winner get a temporal 'round score' same as the value of the played card. For example 3 players played 3 of spade, 7 of clover and 7 of heart, the second player win the trick and get 7 poits of score. To show this the defeated cards are let face down again.
 
 *** Round
 Repeat 3 turns. And then calculate the round score. That is total of values of your opened cards in the round. If you have no opened cards, your score is 0. If you have an opened card 7, your score is 7. If you have two opened cards 7 and 5, your score is 12. The median scored player win the round. The defeated players lost their 'round score.' To show this, the defeated players make their cards in the round face-down again. Winner's round score changes a permanent 'game score'.
 
 Notice if there are two or three players of same round score, all of them are median and win the round. When only one player got round score (e.g. scores for each player are 0, 0, 23), the median is 0 and winners get 0 points. So nobody get game score.
 
 *** Game
 Deal cards and repeat 5 rounds. And then calculate the game score, that is total of round scores of all rounds. Winner of the game is the median scored player. 
 
 *** Appendix
 To make the game zero-sum: When a number of winner is 1, winner get +2 points and loser get -1 points. When a number of winner is 2, winner get +1 points and loser get -2 points.

 The estimated cost of moving 4 minutes away from the station was 35,000 yen. I wonder if it would cost that much.
 
 Well, at least I don't have to worry about running out of places to live. I have enough clothes to keep me warm, and now I just need to eat. I ate the leftover rice I cooked yesterday for lunch, but it didn't seem to be enough, and I was already hungry. I wonder if I am sleepy because my blood sugar is low. What should I do?
