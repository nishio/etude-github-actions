Examples of bad cleanup
	Take things from the clutter pile, throw some away, and sort the rest on the floor.
 Time limits come and go as holidays run out or you get sleepy.

	Time is a limited resource, but we design tasks under the assumption that it is infinite.

Example

Therefore, divide and conquer.
One pomodoro, clear your desk." Then, one pomodoro and it's over for sure.
If you throw away trash, you make progress as much as you throw away.
