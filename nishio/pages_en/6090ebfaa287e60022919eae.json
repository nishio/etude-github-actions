 *1221368735* Nightmares
 - catch a cold
 - sleep (lying down)
 - I wake up in the middle of the night.
 - I'm going to the bathroom.
 - Something big and black quickly hides behind the tank (goosebumps).
 
 interjection expressing surprise, pain, fear, or disgust
 
 
 At any rate, it would be a nuisance if they came out of the bathroom, so I left the lights on and got some bleach from the kitchen and put up some wards. Detergent might have been better.
 
 I go to a convenience store to buy a weapon, but they don't sell them. Convenience stores are stupid. They should take a little space where they have a lot of stationery and put some insecticides. Insecticides don't hurt, and when people come to buy them, it's an emergency, so they'll buy them even if the price is a little high.
 
 I had no choice but to dissolve the detergent in water and pour it on. It was too thin! He rushed out but clung to the tank! I add more detergent and splash it on! Gee, I ran frantically! Over the wards and out of the bathroom! Climbing the wall! Stop! Die! Die quickly!
 
 
 Fuu.
 
 Dead.
 
 However, the battle resulted in a disaster in which a fairly large area of the restroom and hallway were covered in detergent.
 When the supermarket opens tomorrow, I'll get some Goki Pao and take care of it.

 - getting up
 - Oh, I have to clean that up... I feel so overwhelmed...
 - Games.
 - You realize you can't go to the bathroom or get a drink from the fridge if you don't clean up.
 - Fearfully opening the door and peering into the battlefield
 - Ohhhhh! He's not there! He must have risen and escaped! (Teary eyes)
 
 That's the thing, I realized how effective guerrilla warfare is. I realized how mentally draining it is just not knowing where they are lurking.
 
 I almost cried and went to the supermarket to get a weapon for the time being, but they didn't sell the Goki Pao, which I had come to rely on. I guessed that someone had used it near a fire without reading the warning that it was flammable like the ice-killing jet, and it had to be recalled. It is a hindrance to progress to have such a useful tool of civilization disabled just because someone uses it incorrectly, so I would like to see a system whereby a doctor of science can buy it through a different route.

 post-processing flow
 - Fall asleep with clothes on and lights on and wake up at 7pm
 - Cracking headache. Hydration.
 - I return to the futon. A chill runs through my body even as I wrap myself in the blankets.
 - I'm going back to bed.
 - I wake up at 24:00‚Üêhere and now
 
 **1221406951*Nutritional deficiencies
 I had a cold, so I went shopping with the idea that I could consume it even if I didn't have an appetite and not lack the necessary nutrients.

 Question:
 One important nutrient is missing. What is it?
 
 
 
 
 
 Answer:
 I had completely forgotten about it because it is rare that we are deficient in it in our daily diet; in fact, it is something we have to reduce due to overconsumption. That key nutrient is salt (sodium). Sodium is lost through sweat, but we don't make up for it at all. I should have bought a sports drink instead of bottled tea. I'm making miso soup now.
