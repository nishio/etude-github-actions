　Thoughts.
　　Well, the order of the strings doesn't matter, so they'll be in the frequency table first.
　　About each character
　　　If the supply at S1 is less than the demand, the difference must be taken from S2. The reverse is also true.
　　　Accumulate this "number of letters to take" and if it exceeds N, NG
　　　If it doesn't exceed, how can you say it's OK?
　　　　I can't think of any particular counterexamples...
　　　If not exceeded, it means that the remaining letters are either in S1 or S2 and can be taken from either.
　　　　So OK.
