The set of things we want to do does not exist.

	Often portray "[I want to do]" as if it were a set.

	This picture could be misleading.
		Implicitly assumes "the existence of 'wanting to do' as a set of things".


	I think there is not a "set of things you want to do," but rather a "[wanting to do] axis.

	The one you want to do the most is chosen from among the [options for action] that come up in your consciousness.
	So [expanding what you can do creates what you want to do] also happens.
	Given that, the question, "[What do you want to do? question itself may be misleading.
	Think about something you don't want to do."
		Advice often given to people who "can't find what they want to do."
		By verbalizing what you don't want to do, you can understand what you do want to do the other way around.

	Whether I want to do something or not, I'm doing something.
		I may be a slacker, but I'm not a Twitter user.
		The problem is that the "doing" isn't that much fun.
	Maybe a more useful question would be, "[What's the fun in it]?"
		Or more specifically, "What did you do in the past when you felt like having fun?"

	People who say, "[I can't find what I want to do]."
		Cases with few options for action in the first place -> see and learn about various options

	It is misleading to think that "[should]" (the set of things that others thought would be good to do) and "[can]" (the set of things that can be done) are sets, but "I want to" is the same
