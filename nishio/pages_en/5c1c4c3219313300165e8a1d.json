Management Perspective
Management: "Have a management perspective."
Employee: "If you want me to have a manager's perspective, pay me as much as a manager."

It may seem to make sense locally, but a little perspective reveals that the same logic can be used to say the opposite.

Employee: "Pay me as much as management."
Management: "If you want me to pay you as much as a manager, then you have to have a manager's perspective."

Therefore, this logic is stuck in a deadlock.

On the employee side, workarounds include "becoming a manager by starting a business" or "joining a venture with a small number of employees, which makes it easier to be exposed to the manager's perspective.
There are measures to avoid this on the part of management, such as the [new graduate president system] and giving greater discretion to capable young people.
