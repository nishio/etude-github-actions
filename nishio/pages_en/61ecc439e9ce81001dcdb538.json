Reasons for Speaking in Parables
>10The disciples approached Jesus and said, "Why do you speak to those people in parables?
> 11Jesus answered. For you are permitted to realize the secret of the kingdom of heaven, but they are not permitted to do so.
> 12 Those who have will be given more and become rich, but those who do not have will even have what they have taken away.
> 13Therefore I speak to them in parables. For they see and do not see, they hear and do not hear, and they do not understand.
>... Blessed are your eyes, for they see. Blessed are your ears, for they hear.
> 17For I tell you plainly. Many prophets and righteous men wanted to see what you are seeing, but could not see, and wanted to hear what you are hearing, but could not hear."

[Those who have will be given even more and become rich] will be found here as well.

I was surprised when he clearly stated that he does not use parables for the sake of clarity.
It is similar to [Sanyutta Nikaya 6.1.1] to shun those who do not try to understand.

I am not sure how to interpret this statement.
