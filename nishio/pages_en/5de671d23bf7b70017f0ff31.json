		I'm doing it on my iPhone, like I'm posting it on Facebook.
			It's true that sometimes it's nice to have a quick diagram when you're doing this kind of writing.
		It might be nice to release a slightly more creative UI for the iPhone.
		It would be convenient if it could be saved automatically and viewed later on a PC.
		Facebook can be written offline.
  	It will be posted when you are online.
 		However, you need to give the "resubmit" instructions one by one manually, not automatically.
	 Skype used to have this kind of chat-like interface for sending quick handwritten notes.
		Style of writing more and more text fragments
