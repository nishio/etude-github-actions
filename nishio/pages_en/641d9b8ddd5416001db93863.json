People on the move connect people who settle down.

I've been calling a concept I've been wondering about recently "[nomad]", but it was a bit out of bounds. The proper name for the concept I was looking for is "[migratory people]".
　Its synonym is "[a] person who settles down."
　People who move are not necessarily [nomadic]. The [trader] is also an option.
　　They do not necessarily move on the ground. A [trader] who [trades] by ship is also a person who moves.
　　　[(7.2.5) Trade commercial strategies for knowledge across organizational boundaries].
　　[Movement extends the range of observation.]
　　　The [range of observation] of people who settle down is small.
　People who move [connect] and [network] the "people who settle" who would otherwise be [isolated].

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639251123222745089] @0xtkgshn The "people on the move" story from 2 years ago and the nomadic story I've been thinking about lately are connected!
>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639251273777049600] This is that one, right, like how to know [life choices]?
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639255655969341440] Yes. People who move have a wider range of observation and know [options], people who settle have a narrower view. This and the story of "[knowledge traders]" who create value by carrying [knowledge] gained in this way, and the recent thought of "[nomads]" abstracted to "[people on the move]" and including [traders], are connected.
>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639266613085044740] Moving beyond physical, community, currency, language, and many other things allows us to see the place we were and the subject relatively (objective) for the first time. ), so I believe that movement as a concept is highly valuable! This is the reason why I think that movement as a concept is so valuable! This is thanks to @hassyadai, where I was asked the question "What is [cognitive/selectional disparity]? This is thanks to the question I was asked by @hassyadai!

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639256422197383168] Because from the point of view of people who settle down, [visitors] look like "[weirdos]."

That was @[DeCartography]'s challenge. Simply put, identify identities in the Ethereum ecosystem and make decisions about "which public goods to support?" and collaborate with @[Gitcoin] to make decisions about
>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1639268164692328450] Cartography is Greek for the art of map writing, isn't it?
> This idea of putting identity into a map is similar to Hiroki Azuma's [Visualization of General Will] and Yusuke Narita's [Algorithmic Democracy].
> Since the action history on Ethereum is on-chain and [Permissionless], Gitcoin's [Quadratic Funding] voting power adjustment based on it.
