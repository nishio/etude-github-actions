作業用BGM
	(When?) When music was abundant with MIDI, I used MIDI of animated songs, Pfaffelbel's Canon, etc. as background music.

 MIDI faded into the age of MP3.
  I was using PaceMaker, Winamp's fast playback add-on.
 I now play background music on my iPhone.
  Make a 25-minute playlist and use it for Pomodoro.
  Choose a song that is not playing at high speed, but the song itself is fast.
  The last song is a slow one, which naturally expresses that the end of the pomodoro is near.
 I haven't used it for a while because I lost my songs during an iPhone upgrade.
 I see that Hiroshi Mori also uses work background music to quickly start up his concentration in [I Don't Need Concentration], and I think about resuming it.
 Put songs in Dropbox and play them on Evermusic, which can play songs in Dropbox.
