I hate "just do it."
	It's just a [mentality].
	Is the person who says, "Do it anyway," actually doing it all the time?
		If it's not done, it's [deceptive].
	Without thinking about "why we can't do it," it is not sustainable to "just do it" under external pressure.
	Why can't I do it?" is an individual's inner challenge.
		Others can't solve it for you.
	The ability to solve one's [inner challenges] is a more important long-term ability than individual "just do it"
		[Internal observation] is an important preliminary step.
		Ignoring the importance of "[observation]" and imposing the mentality of "just do it" is harmful to the subject.

	[Do it anyway" is not the last line.]
