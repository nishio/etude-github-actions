One means to multiple ends.
One means can have multiple purposes.
It's the kind of thing that says, "If you make this part, you can use it for this and that.
It seems to me that a state with multiple objectives is "[killing] two birds with one stone," and is a good state to aim for, using time efficiently.
However, a situation may arise during the process of making a part that says, "If we use policy A for this part, it will fulfill objective X, and if we use policy B, it will fulfill objective Y, but there is no way to fulfill both objectives.
So it would be counterproductive to melt large amounts of time looking for a way to satisfy both.
