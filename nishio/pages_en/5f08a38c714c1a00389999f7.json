　How many ways [count up] are there to cut out a repeating string of "25" from a given string?
　Given a substring of N followed by 25, the number of pieces that [tri(N)] tri(N) can cut out of the substring
　It's faster to use [regex] to cut out the continuation than to loop through it yourself.
　Because I didn't make it test-driven because I thought it would be easy, I forgot the specification that "if parentheses are used in a regular expression, findall will return only that range" and I WA'd.
　`(? : )` is a non-capturing grouping
code:python
 import re 
 
 def tri(x):
     return x * (x + 1) // 2
 
 S = input()
 ret = 0
 print(sum(tri(len(s) // 2) for s in re.findall("(?:25)+", S)))
