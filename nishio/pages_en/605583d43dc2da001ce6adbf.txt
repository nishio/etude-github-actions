✅I want to display book shadows mechanically in Scrapbox.
It is possible to create a book image URL from an ASIN.
`http://images-jp.amazon.com/images/P/{ASIN}.09.LZZZZZZZ.jpg`

However, this is HTTP, so it cannot be displayed directly from Scrapbox
　Related [Latest Chrome does not allow HTTP images to be displayed on HTTPS pages].

Technical Solutions
　Download the file to your hand via HTTP and then upload it back to [Gyazo].
