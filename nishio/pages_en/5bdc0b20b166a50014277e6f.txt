Results and Appeals
A comment in reply to someone's private post.

People who do one interesting thing after another do another interesting thing immediately after doing one interesting thing without [appealing to] the [results], so they may be misunderstood as not having done much when compared to "people who only achieved one result but invested the rest of their time in appealing to the fact that they achieved that result. I think it would be misinterpreted as not making much of a difference.

After reading this again, I remembered [Do not set numerical standards for evaluation of researchers#5a49c7e4aff09e0000233519] to the effect that [it is the responsibility of the person who produced the results to appeal the results], but in this case the evaluator is the supervisor, so the composition is somewhat different.
