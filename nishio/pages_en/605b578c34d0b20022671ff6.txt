Problems that are not solved by trying what you come up with.
When we encounter a problem and try everything we can think of at random, but it is not solved, it is usually because two or more problems are overlapping and we do not know if we are close to our goal even if we solve one of them. In such cases, it is not a question of whether the whole problem has succeeded or failed, but rather of how far the problem has been broken down into smaller pieces and the extent to which it has succeeded.
