Seven Golden Rules of Guerrilla Warfare
[guerrilla warfare].
	Do not fight a losing battle.
 Always keep moving. [Hit and run, attack and retreat.
 	#Multi-powered
 [Consider the enemy to be the main supplier of weapons.
 Hide the movement.
 Use [surprise] in military actions.
 If there is enough strength, create a new vertical line.
 In general, three things should be kept in mind while proceeding. Namely,
 	Strategic Defense,
  Balance between enemy and guerrilla actions,
  Decrease in the destruction of the enemy

While it is helpful in some ways, it assumes a situation where there is a clear "enemy," which is a problem common to many [military] books.
The phrase "weapons should be taken from the enemy" is "the enemy" in war, but when translated into the context of management theory for resource-poor organizations, it is "resources should be acquired from outside," and this "outside" is often not appropriate to be described as "the enemy" because it is a "partner" that provides resources. Also, in the case of war, there is one enemy, but there can be multiple external resource providers.
