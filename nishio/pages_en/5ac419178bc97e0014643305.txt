Draw with Apple Pencil and paste into Scrapbox

>(nishio) I wonder how to draw more and more diagrams with [Apple Pencil] and put more and more on [Scrapbox]...
 >(shiology) I write on "[GEMBA Note]" or "[MetaMoJi Note]" with my iPad and Apple Pencil, send it to [Gyazo] with [Send] -> [Send to Application], and paste it into Scrapbox with Google Chrome app. The same is done with other drawing apps. The same goes for other drawing apps. If there is a better way, please let me know.
 	I completely forgot about the Gyazo app.
  	Somehow it disappeared from the "Send" menu.
  When you "send" an image, the URL is copied to the clipboard.
  All you have to do is paste the URL into Scrapbox
   In both Safari and Chrome, there is a paste on the soft keyboard, so you can use that.
   Dr. Shiozawa seems to use Chrome exclusively for Scrapbox, which sounds good, so I'm going to copy him.
  Unfortunately, the Notability I'm using doesn't have an image export, so I can't use this.
  	Gyazo does not appear as the destination because it is exported as a PDF
  	Screenshot to do it from Notability
   Screenshots are one more step, but you can crop any area you want.

			I thought I could send it to Gyazo because Noteshelf can export it as PNG, but it doesn't appear in the destination either, why?


 >(masui) I think Scrapbox's draw function is the easiest. If you want to draw a great picture, it would be via Gyazo...

  If you are writing in Scrapbox and want to draw a little diagram, this might be a good option.
  Looks tacky.
  Well, if I want to make it beautiful, I should ask an illustrator to do a clean copy instead of me trying to make it beautiful.
