	A naive treatment of second-order combinatorial features would result in D^2 parameters with the number of features as D
 Then, we assign a K-dimensional vector to each feature, and apply the constraint that the weights of the combinatorial features are the inner products of the K-dimensional vectors.
 That is, like this [$ \hat{y}(\mathbf{x}) := w_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i+1}^n \langle \mathbf{v_i}, \mathbf{v_j} \rangle x_i x_j ]
 This reduces the number of parameters to D*K
