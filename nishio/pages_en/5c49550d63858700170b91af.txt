Attributes of relationships rather than single attributes
[attribute of a relationship], not [attribute of a single entity].
[attribute] of [relationship], not a stand-alone attribute.
We had the same conversation in [communication skills].
Suppose there is trouble in communication between Mr. A and Mr. B.
The incident is neither a problem of Mr. A [alone] nor Mr. B alone, but a problem caused by the relationship between Mr. A and Mr. B. It is not right to blame one for the other.

When the key didn't fit in the keyhole, it wasn't a keyhole problem or a key problem, but a [relationship problem] that the key in the keyhole was [mismatched].

[Parable of the clapping hands]
