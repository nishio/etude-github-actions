 The president of Sakura Internet, Mr. Sasada, is a MMORPG EverQuest (hereinafter referred to as "EQ") geek, and he said that the main members of the company were recruited from the EQ guild, and I, who was also heavily into EQ, felt a lot of sympathy with him. No, that was not the reason for the selection.

 The company posted an impairment loss of 391 million yen for the exclusive license and fixed assets of "Lord of the Rings Online" in its online game business. The company posted a final loss of 575 million yen for the same period and also fell into excess liabilities.

 I'm crying...orz

 So, the content of the social study. I just studied the meaning of words like impairment accounting and insolvency and stuff like that.
 You say that impairment accounting is when you write "no, it didn't work" on your books when you say "no, it didn't work". For example, if you make yakisoba at a school festival, when you buy the noodles, they are not yet a loss because they were purchased for the purpose of making yakisoba and selling them for a profit, but if you accidentally fall and smash them on the floor before making yakisoba, you cannot sell them anymore, and you must write the loss incurred in some form in your books of account. In the case of yakisoba, it is the cost of purchasing the noodles. In the case of yakisoba, it can be expressed as the difference between purchase cost and sales, but there are some items that cannot be expressed well, so they should be accounted for as impairment losses.
 And by insolvency, do you mean "I've run out of money >? Assuming you originally have 5 million yen, if you borrow 5 million yen to buy a 10 million yen car, you are not insolvent at this point, because a car worth 1 million yen is "an asset to generate profit in the future. If the car gets into an accident and is scrapped, the asset is gone and only the 5 million yen loan remains. This is insolvency. In other words, insolvency is a state in which all the money other than debt (collected from shareholders by issuing shares or provided by the company itself) is gone and the company is even more in the negative. I kind of imagined a situation where interest payments are more than income, but it doesn't seem to go that far. But well, all the money invested by the shareholders is gone, so if the company were to fold and produce now, not a single yen would be returned to the shareholders.
 So what are they going to do now that they are in such a difficult situation, on the verge of bankruptcy? First, they are going to sell their Internet access business. What this means is that they're going to get some cash they can use "now" by selling for 8,000 yen to another club now the books they bought for the used bookstore, which is expected to make a profit of 10,000 yen during the 3-day festival.
 The rest of the time, they would do something called a third-party allotment of new shares. This was difficult. If I say, "If I have 1,000 yen now, I can buy noodles again and sell them at the festival to make 20,000 yen, and without 1,000 yen I will have to throw away vegetables and pork," some people will say, "Well, then, let's invest 1,000 yen. In a way, it is the same as issuing stock to start a new business. The only difference is that you already have a track record of how much money you have made through your business, and you already have customers like Hatena and mixi.
 
 I understood it much better. Classmates who had originally invested in the yakisoba business said, "Actually, the noodles fell on the floor and became inedible," "The used book business that was supposed to make a profit is being sold because there is no money," "The money we had invested in the business is gone, and instead, a new investor will provide enough money to continue the business in the future. Instead, the new investors will make enough money to continue the business in the future. The profit per person will probably be half of what it used to be. Is that right? That's a lot of work.
 
 And one thing I still don't understand. Why is Sakura Internet stopped today? ？？？？ Did you read the IR material that says that the game division, which is in the red, might have to continue next year because "the contract cannot be broken without mutual agreement" with the copyright holder... or did you just read that or something?

 Well, I have been thinking for a while now that my vision seems to be very different from that of the average person.
 I have a green background because black on white hurts my eyes and makes it hard to read, but apparently green is harder to read for the average person.
 
 I remember when I used to share a monitor with Mr. Fushida in the workshop and we used to play around with contrast and brightness settings every time we used the monitor.
 It's a struggle: I always lower the contrast and brightness as much as possible, while Fushida always brings it back to 100%.

 Tomorrow.

 however
 
 The event coincides with the Unexplored Youth results briefing!
 
 ...I'll go to the youth one.
 
 *1196421570* One of the Day
 A wrench that invites you to turn one today.
 
 This is hard to understand, so let me explain. A wrench was left attached to the mouth of a large tank at a construction site. Can I turn it?
 
 As expected, I decided not to do this because it would be bad if an explosion and fire accident occurred in front of the lab.

 Nice geek!
 I would strongly suggest Nice Geek as an alternative term to Nice Guy.

 Is that what you say when the last episode resembles a real-life incident and is hastily replaced with interview footage of people holding purple things to their mouths or something?
 
 *1196441564* I need to sleep.
 I have to stay up.
 I wonder if I can be in Akihabara tomorrow at 10:00.
 
 *1196442062*__hash__
 http://d.hatena.ne.jp/morchin/20071130/p1
 Read the following.
 
 Reprinted from object.c
 >|c|
 long
 PyObject_Hash(PyObject *v)
 {
 	PyTypeObject *tp = v->ob_type;
 	if (tp->tp_hash != NULL)
 		return (*tp->tp_hash)(v);
 	if (tp->tp_compare == NULL && RICHCOMPARE(tp) == NULL) {
 		return _Py_HashPointer(v); /* Use address as hash value */
 	}
 	/* If there's a cmp but no hash defined, the object can't be hashed */
 	PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError, "unhashable type: '%.200s'",
 		     v->ob_type->tp_name);
 	return -1;
 }
 ||<
 
 Hmmm, I kinda get it, but I don't understand why the condition "tp->tp_compare == NULL && RICHCOMPARE(tp) == NULL" is necessary. if you have tp_hash, calculate hash value with it, if not, calculate from pointer value. It would be better to just calculate the hash value from the pointer value. I guess from the behavior, "tp->tp_compare == NULL && RICHCOMPARE(tp) == NULL" should cause the list to be played, though.
 
 I have to get up tomorrow morning to go, but I'm going to sleep.
