Scrapbox thing
[https://gyazo.com/d2008da658054a7820ce06b8a5de5a6d]
	Metaphor for [tag
		Tags and tagged objects are different
		Several existing software offer the ability to "list objects with the same tag".
	Metaphor for [link
		A link connects multiple like-linked objects.
		Tends to implicitly assume that the linkage target exists at the present time
	[Scrapbox] thing.
		Can connect pages to "pages that do not exist at this time
		When multiple pages A, B, and C are connected to the same page X, navigation to the other two pages appears at the bottom of each page A, B, and C ([2-hop link]).
		ã€€X can be a page that doesn't exist.
 		When a non-existent = blank page is opened, navigation to each page connected to that page is displayed.
 			= Tag-like usage is possible.

What do you call "that thing" in light of this?
	I, like the official, think "link" is fine.
	However, many people don't understand the feature of "being able to link to something that doesn't exist," so I think it's better to explain it to them in a generous way.
	Calling it a "tag" is misleading to a narrow range of uses.
		You can also write `#tags` and use them in a tag-like fashion."
		The Scrapbox thing is a more abstract function that encompasses both the "tag" function and the "link to something that exists" function.
			Difficult to get used to because of its high level of abstraction, but useful once you get used to using it.
