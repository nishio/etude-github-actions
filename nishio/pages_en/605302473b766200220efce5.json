The "good old boy" is a curse.
Throwing the words "[good old] do X" and "good old don't do Y" at others is a [curse] that reduces the range of behavior when you get older, not only for that person but also for the person who has been there.

It's not good when you get old and your behavior becomes fixed, because it causes [senility] and [dementia].

[Age does not matter.]
