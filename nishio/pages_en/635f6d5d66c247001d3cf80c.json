Prompt: "A girl with flower."
[https://gyazo.com/a51b5ec3276a8c2fb8a0f4f5f0dc5835][https://gyazo.com/c8ac3d72eb45ff23f4147c9e13002bb8][https://gyazo.com/1db5b8b4203ca0871c9f7f24f24fdc9d][https://gyazo.com/17d0abc1e7bfa9a0cca8eb58815812b7]
Oh, if you only specify GIRL, then cat ears and hair color features that are not specified will be ignored.

Original Prompt + "with flower"

This time, only the background color has changed.

Is [Gradio] going to bring up the GUI, that's great.
　Prompt strength was set to 0.9 by default.
　I'll chop it up because it didn't change much when I set it to 1, and when I set it to 2, it broke down considerably.

I'd say this or something like this retains the characteristics of the original image, but with flowers as indicated.
　I was expecting a single flower decoration.
　I never thought I'd interpret ear hairs as flowers.
　Well, but I might decorate it that way, I guess.

Interesting points
　The original image was created by NovelAI
　Imagic itself is based on Stable Diffusion 1.4
　As a result, it is possible to express the animated picture in a way that is not possible on NovelAI's service, which should be quite difficult with Stable Diffusion by itself.

		This is close to what I was hoping for.
		I noticed I left "{{3d}}" in the negative prompt, so I removed it, but it doesn't make much difference.

			The second is the SEED difference
