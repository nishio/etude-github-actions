Scientific Knowledge and Technological Principles
Listening to [Shuzo Fujimura] talk about how the principle of technology came into being, I connected it to the picture of concrete and abstract that [Kazuhiro Shiozawa] explained in his law school class, so I wrote it down.

We observe natural phenomena, gather concrete facts, and hypothesize that they are manifested as different phenomena due to the action of different parameters on a unifying principle.
Based on the hypothesis, an experimental design is made that a certain result should be obtained for a certain parameter, and if the result is as expected, the certainty of the hypothesis is increased.

This verification is sufficient if the results can be predicted for a certain parameter. In order to apply the knowledge obtained, it is necessary to have the knowledge to predict the parameters to achieve the desired result.

If both are obtained and the needs of the customer and your own needs, i.e., what you want to create, are clear, you can adjust the parameters to cause the phenomenon to meet those needs.
