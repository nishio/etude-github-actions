(4.3) How to read a page in two seconds to find information
Let's look at the [pyramid of reading speed] again. I have explained the two reference lines C and F and the "not to read" above C. The rest of pyramid is divided into "[fast reading]" above F and "[slow reading]" below F. There are two purposes of reading: "[finding information]" and "[building understanding]." Fast reading is focused on finding information. Existing [speed-reading techniques] are helpful for learning how to find information. So, I will introduce two speed-reading techniques.

First of all, I introduce [Paul R. Scheele]'s "[The PhotoReading Whole Mind System]."
Interestingly to this book, there is written how to read this book itself at three levels. Three kinds of marks are written in each paragraph according to importance, and by using it, we can choose three ways of reading. The method is as follows.

	[* Level 1 (25 minutes)]
		First, check the table of contents, headings of each chapter, and subheadings.
  Next, find the paragraph with the mark 1 from the whole book, read only that.
 [* Level 2 (+30 minutes)]
  Furthermore, search the paragraph with the mark 2 from the entire book, read only that.
 [* Level 3 (+ 45 to 90 minutes)]
  Again, while checking headings and subheadings, find the paragraph with the mark 3 and read only that.

This book is about 250 pages. As we read it at 25 minutes, 55 minutes, 145 minutes, it is roughly 10 pages per minute, 5 pages per minute, 2 pages per minute, respectively. In [reading aloud], it is 1/3 page per minute, so it is certainly 6 to 30 times faster than it.

On the other hand, some people think that it will not take 145 minutes even if reading ordinary on 250 pages of general books. It is not my intention to agree with the claim that "I can read 10 times faster" to introduce this book here. This book is talking about "the importance of preparation", "stepwise detailing", "repeated reading" which are common concepts with many other fast reading books, it is very useful to introduce those concepts .
