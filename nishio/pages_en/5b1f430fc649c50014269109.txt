I need a bigger wall.
	Metaphor of putting information ([sticky note]) on the wall
 	It is useful to arrange information to increase [listability].
  This is the basic concept of the [KJ method] [label alignment].
  But you can't carry around a physical wall with information pasted on it.
  Limited wall space available.
 With [VR], you can "take the wall with you."
 	No need to clean up
  Endless walls and desks boil over.
  Usefulness as an Intellectual Productivity Tool
 The ability to use an infinite number of walls and desk surfaces is useful as an extension of the current system, but the benefit of increased freedom of viewpoint is significant.
  [KJ method, clean spaces and mind palaces].
  There are an infinite number of [large walls], and you can [teleport] to another wall just by clicking on a sticky note on the wall.
  You can also stand at that spot on the wall, on a sticky note, and look around. Related: [freedom from physics].
 The metaphor of "the wall" is very much tied to physical constraints.
  I think a better metaphor would be [scuba diving], where you can move around in three dimensions.
  Of course, if you don't dive deep and work only on the surface, you can use it just like a wall.
