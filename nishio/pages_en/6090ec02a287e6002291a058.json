 Even if we cooperate and line them up in a tight row, we'll still have 15 left over.

 I tried playing by myself again, but perhaps because both players are me, it inevitably becomes a dead heat at the end. Both players knew well enough that the other wanted to increase the lowest score, so they blocked the color that would trigger it, and as a result, blue and red were both tied and no additional points were possible. As a result, the back side would have won if they could have scored one more point for purple, but they lost by a narrow margin. Is this the kind of game designed for a dead heat at the end of the game, or is it because of the double role of one person?
