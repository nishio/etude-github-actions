 *1341581311*Diary of EDSAC's WadaSeive not understanding
 Now that I have a working program that displays square numbers on my own EDSAC simulator, I thought the next step would be to get WadaSeive working...
 
 (WadaSeive: http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~edsac/Programs/WadaSieve.html )
 
 This program doesn't start with the first letter T, does it? My current understanding is that the initial order is to read T(addr)S placed at the beginning of the program to determine how far to read the tape... I wonder if it is read from T834K after the subroutine that says P6. If so, what does the subroutine do? I wonder if it would be put in the same way as the initial order, not from the tape. But, the address to write the data read by the initial order would have to be changed accordingly. I wonder how it would be done.
 
 (The explanation I referred to: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/edsacposter.pdf )
 
 Also, I'm thinking the last bit is L or S, but with this code, I'm getting K or F or D.... I wonder what it means...
