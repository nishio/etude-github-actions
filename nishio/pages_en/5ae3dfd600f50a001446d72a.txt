 >The [powerless aesthetic] hates the [intellect] because it demands what it cannot do, but the life of the [spirit] is not the life that avoids death and keeps itself clean from desolation, but the life that endures death and sustains itself in death.
 >The spirit acquires [truth] because it places itself in [the absolute division].
 >The spirit does not demonstrate knowledge by turning away from the negative and becoming a mass of affirmations.
 >The spirit is powerful precisely because it [faces the negative] and stays with it.
 >While remaining there, the magic power to turn negativity into existence is born.

 The so-called "[Hegel's] dialectic" idea.
 The word [dialectic] itself is not used by Hegel.
 By facing and staying with the negative rather than ignoring it, a reversal to existence occurs.
