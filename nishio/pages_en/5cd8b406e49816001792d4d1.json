界面
>An interface is the boundary between a homogeneous liquid or solid phase and another homogeneous phase. When the "other homogeneous phase" is a gas or a vacuum, the interface is specifically called a surface (there are exceptions). However, they do not completely mix with each other (if they do, they cease to be an interface. (However, they may form compounds composed of each other's atoms in a few atomic layers near the interface.)
