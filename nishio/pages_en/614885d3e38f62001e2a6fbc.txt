10x low-speed logic analyzer
[https://gyazo.com/01792cf2916fe9b4083f1662d45cc46a]

I wanted to observe the behavior of long width pulses in mycla, so I modified [Logic Analyzer @ mycla] to advance one tick per second instead of 0.1 tick per second.

principle
ã€€Create a signal that is off for only one of the 10 ticks and run it through the control line of the logic analyzer. The signal display only moves forward when the control line is OFF, so one second is one square.
