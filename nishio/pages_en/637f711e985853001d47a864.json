[Cmd+Shift+4] to enter the clipboard
　Cmd+Shift+4 for range selection screenshot.
　Placed on the desktop in the default configuration
　Adding Ctrl goes directly to the clipboard.
　　But it's more of a hassle when I want to put it on the clipboard more often than not.
　Replace keyboard shortcuts
　　Make sure to press Ctrl when you want to save to a file

incidentally
　Save to "Documents" instead of "Desktop".
　　This can be changed from the UI displayed by Cmd+Shift+5

	I remembered that Cmd+Shift+4 can take a screenshot of a specified range, but it saves the file to the desktop.
 	Adding Ctrl goes directly to the clipboard.
 		→ Touch bar to change the destination.

	I frequently forget to press Ctrl to put screenshots into the clipboard.
	I've switched shortcut keys because I'm much more likely to put something on the clipboard than to save it to a file.

		I thought the behavior used to be "save to file but also go into the clipboard".
