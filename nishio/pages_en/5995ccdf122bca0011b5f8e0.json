[Idea method] p.107

BAD does not mean "bad." It just means "a collection of specific data."

The story of how "[primary ideas]" (some might call them "[hypotheses]") inspired by the data collected are then developed.
 Contradictory information appears in "[The Fall]"
	Undeveloped," in which no particularly relevant information appears and remains the same.
 Multiple similar information comes up "[gaining] stability."
 Information that might be relevant emerges, and higher-order ideas are launched "[gaining] inclusiveness."

I think it is difficult to tell the difference between gaining stability and gaining inclusiveness because this is all on one diagram.
	Stability gains are merely supported from blocks 2, 3, and 4.
	The acquisition of inclusiveness is born out of 1 and 2, becomes even higher in connection with 3, and then becomes even higher in connection with 4, and then combines once again with the others in 1.
	The right-to-left arrows on the cumulative process (perhaps it's just the age of vertically written books, but it doesn't feel right now).

The process of gaining stability and comprehensiveness without leading to underdevelopment or downfall is a process of increasing certainty through [the consistency of knowledge].

[Idea] [Consistent coupling].
	When ideas contradict each other, it is the "downfall" in this diagram
