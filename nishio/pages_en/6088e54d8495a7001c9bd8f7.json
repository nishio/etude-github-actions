fruitless argument
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387240962863243267]: it seems to me that those who feel the backlash of one overreach are making another overreach and it's turning into a sterile water-boarding argument...
	>"It is always the enterprise companies and those around them who introduce agile as a startup way of doing things and say we should copy the startup way. They are not the ones who know firsthand how startups do things. And they take the liberty of developing an image of a cool startup, idealize it, and try to make their own development flow 'agile'."

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387242737028661250]: In the logic of "A is bad", "B is always A", and "therefore B is bad", the conclusion seems correct because "A is bad" is obvious, but "B is is always A" is a strange generalization.
	>"People who move to startups ask me, "Why don't they do Agile here? We're a startup, and they say, "That's not cool. That's not cool." That's the problem.
	>"The mistake in the first place was to try to force a goal on a development that had no goal."

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387243634597142534]: some of the past notes are relevant, but not exactly attributed, so let's just collect them and look at them and then think about the differences.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387244089196699653]: this is about "identifying an inferior and prominent member of a group of people with the group to which he or she belongs"

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387245550559383554]: if "B is A" in the range of observation, it is strange to derive "B is always A" from it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387246352292220937]: "generalizing past bad experiences" was on the link, but not on the page.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387246870880129024]: when we judge something from a past experience, when exactly was that experience? We tend to implicitly assume that nothing has changed since that experience, but is that assumption correct? The further into the past we get, the higher the probability that we are wrong.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387248416837697538]: You're discussing whether "MyBigClass" is good or bad, but no, that class is not very cohesive to begin with, so there's no point in discussing the class as a whole. I think we need to clarify which part of the class we are talking about.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387248837018873859]: the reason we are treating what should be discussed separately as a lump concept is because we can't distinguish the difference if our [cognitive resolution] is low.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387249561182240770]: the title of the page is hard to understand, but this diagram seems to be the best way to see how some people perceive the same thing as "the same" and others as "different" [of cognition 1D version of resolution].

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387249813901611009]: this looks like I should make a page explaining this in more detail

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387251654894837761]: I described it as "less cohesive" but maybe I should have described it as "more cohesive". ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%. 90....

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1387252730972938242]: it is strange to treat X as if it were a monolithic concept when there is a word X that loosely encloses multiple concepts that are partially common or related
