Does every word mean one thing?
The idea that "every word has one meaning" and that "a word names an object" is a fallacy, [Wittgenstein] wrote in [Philosophical Investigations].
In Blue and Brown books, "One of the greatest causes of [philosophical puzzlement] is here. That is, given a [noun], we try to find its counterpart." It also states.

>These words seem to give a specific picture of the nature of human language. In other words, each word in the language names an object - a sentence is a combination of such names. In this image of language, we see the root of the idea that every word has a meaning. This meaning is tied to the word. It is the object to which the word is directed.
[Wittgenstein] [Philosophical Investigations].

>This philosophical notion of meaning rests within a primordial conception of the way language works. But it is an idea of language that is more primordial than our language.

>We can name things and now we can talk about them. We can involve ourselves in them when we talk about them." It is as if the act of naming has already given us what we will do thereafter. It is as if there is only one thing to be said about things. Yet we do so many different kinds of things in writing. Consider exclamations alone. They have a completely different function.
