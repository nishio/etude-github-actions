relative equality theory
>The precedents also consistently adopt the theory of relative equality. For example, Article 14, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution "does not guarantee absolute equality to the people, but should be interpreted as prohibiting discrimination without reasonable grounds for such discrimination. The discriminatory treatment that is recognized as reasonable in accordance with the nature of the matter is not denied by the right law in any way.)

The story is that Supreme Court precedent says, "It's not 'don't discriminate' but 'don't discriminate without reasonable cause.' If there is a reasonable reason, discriminatory treatment is acceptable.

Article 14, Section 1 of the Constitution
>Article 14
> All citizens are equal before the law and shall not be discriminated against in political, economic or social relations on the basis of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin.
