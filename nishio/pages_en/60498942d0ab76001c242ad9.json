gather.town
	>I have used gather.town as a guest, and my impression was that it depends on the facilitator of the event to determine whether it will be lively or not.
	>The event was divided into two parts: a virtual counter (where everyone can hear you when you walk in) and virtual tables (where you can talk with other people when you sit at a table). I liked the fact that the timetable for the day was somewhat fixed, with a time for status updates and a time for chatting among the participants. It might be the same as in real life.

		>I think the excitement of the event depends on the facilitator. I think so. The majority of people are just kind of following along.
　　What is the functionality that this facilitator provides, and can it be provided in software?


	> This is the first time I have used gather.town, and I have discovered that the problem of "the lack of space in the remote get-together tool," which I have been saying for some time, is mitigated to some extent by the presence of space (and the ability to move up, down, left, right), even if only two-dimensionally. I am very happy to see that the "remote get-together tool has no space.
	> I used to think that it would be impossible without reproducing a three-dimensional space such as VR, but I realized that just creating a two-dimensional space would be much better (with [remo], you can only perform limited operations such as "moving your seat," but with weather.town, "an RPG-like two-dimensional space" is exactly as it is. town is a good reproduction of "RPG-like two-dimensional space").
