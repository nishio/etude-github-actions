Preset for development
2020/4/27
I had a preset for development that could be used without getting data from the internet.
That doesn't work, of course, because you've created a structure in memory directly for the old way of holding data.
leaving that aside
Enable reading of data already stored in the cloud.
Ensure that when saving the file, it is saved in a new format
Save the previous drawing as a different name and make sure it reads fine in the new format.
and then embed that cloud data directly for local development.
