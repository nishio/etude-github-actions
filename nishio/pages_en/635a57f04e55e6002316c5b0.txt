[Murder Mystery]

A system where there are four separate sections and communication is possible only within those four sections.
I'm curious to see what others are doing in the distance after I've used up all my action points and can't do anything! (Interesting)

I can't say anything because it would be a spoiler, but I failed to solve the mystery, it was close, it was frustrating.
