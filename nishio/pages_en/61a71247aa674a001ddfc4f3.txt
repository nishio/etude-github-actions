Keichobot for Continuing Users
To lower the hurdle for ordinary users to start using the service, it may be possible to provide another version with user management for some "users who continue to use the service because they find it valuable" (specifically, myself), although it does not have user registration and other functions at this time.

I used to use IndexedDB to produce a "past conversations list" without user management, but it disappeared with the iOS update.
　As for myself personally, I'm not afraid to register for an account.
　off the record flag
　　Starting with the off-the-record flag does not change the fact that the internal state is placed on the server side for operation from the web interface.
　　Can be deleted when done.
　Feature extraction across talks and frequent key phrases can be registered.
