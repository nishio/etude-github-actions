I don't want to improve the countryside, I want to improve Japan from the countryside.
>The slogan "Energize Kansai! is a wonderful slogan and it is good to work hard with that kind of spirit, but it only attracts people from the Kansai region. Everyone wants to improve their own region. Those who live in Sapporo want to improve Sapporo, those in Morioka want to improve Morioka, and those in Kumamoto want to improve Kumamoto. (omission) If we say that we want to improve Japan "from" Kansai, I think many people will gather. The project in Asahimachi, Toyama Prefecture, also says that it wants to improve Toyama and Japan from Asahimachi. That is why so many people gather. Even if you say you want to make Asahimachi a better place, it has nothing to do with you except for the people of Asahimachi. But if I say that I want to improve the local area or start a business "in Asahimachi," many people gather.

Note that what I wanted to say was compact.

I want to improve Japan from the countryside."
