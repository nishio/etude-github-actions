A character who is yang on the outside and yang on the inside.
The term "yang-cha" is short for "yang character," but among those who are active socially, as the term "yang-cha" implies, there are those whose hearts are filled with a brooding, shadowy feeling.
　Hard to observe because they are desperately trying to hide it, but they tend to suck energy out of yang people.

Conversely, some people who avoid partying and prefer to stay home alone are also full of yang qi inside.
　To put it another way, for example, you are making something and you are full of [confidence] that you can create something new in the world.
　People who are "yang on the outside and yin on the inside" can suck up your energy and time, making you uncomfortable and reinforcing your avoidance of party-like occasions.

Some people are shady both inside and outside, so these two axes should be considered independent.

Before the development of [social networking sites], people who were yin on the outside were difficult for society to observe, and only those who were yang on the inside were recognized by society through "created things".
　In other words, people who were shady on both sides were [terminated] by society.
　The advent of social networking services has lowered the bar for transmission, allowing people with low outward energy to become more visible in society.
　　Is this like [Pandora's Box] being opened?
　　Should we think about how to close it, or should we think about how to design the next society in light of this since we no longer have any control over it?
