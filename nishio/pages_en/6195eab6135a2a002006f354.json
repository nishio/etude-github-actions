If I come up with a good title, I'll change it.
　[Books] are already [products of abstraction
　The output of Homo sapiens, with its limited cognitive abilities, after taking in concrete experience, [abstracts] it internally, and then reconstructs it
　If you put yourself in the shoes of a program that has a memory more plentiful and reliable than the temporary memory of Homo sapiens, you will feel like "don't do preprocessing with a poor memory, but output raw data.
　　The difference is whether you want the digital camera to compress JPEGs, or whether you want the sensed values from the image sensor to be raw, as they will later be developed by a high-performance computer.
　　Books written by Homo sapiens for a Homo sapiens audience are like digital cameras with floppy disks as storage.

　Discussion of the merits of Scrapbox, such as "[media that cannot be linked] requires explaining the same thing over and over again, making the information less dense.
　　Paper books are "unlinkable media."
　The format of "a few hundred pages of paper in bulk" is strongly influenced by the convenience of physical distribution.

On the other hand, you can't apply it without abstraction, what do you do about the problem there?
