Different layers.

[series of drawings in which two people say different things]

context
decentralization (of power)
Collective power non-collective power is a false dichotomy
It is one thing for a system to be decentralized; it is another to have a system built on top of that infrastructure that is decentralized.
If something that is made up of multiple layers is viewed as a single lump without identifying the layers, arguments against it can differ.

I was about to write it down, and then I thought this specific example was chewed up by the fact that the definition of "collectivity" is vague in the first place.
　The confusion comes from calling the different layers of relationships by the same name.
　The layers of whether the servers are centralized or distributed, whether the information is centralized like real estate registration or distributed like ownership of personal property.
　The layers of whether power is concentrated in the hands of certain players or broadly distributed among many.
　There is an oppositional structure of "concentration and dispersion" similar to these different layers
　It's not good to conflate those different layers of conflict.
　The ownership of movable property is decentralized, but even on that infrastructure, monopolization of wealth happens, irrelevant story.
　　If those with resources can more easily obtain them, resources will be consolidated
　　If power depends on the amount of resources (often Yes), then those with more resources have more power
