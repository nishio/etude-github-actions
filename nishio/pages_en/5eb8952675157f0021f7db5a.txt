Objects and Phenomena
[The thing itself] and [the phenomenon].
　I think we use the word "phenomenon" as an everyday word without thinking much about it.

>[In Kant], phenomena are contrasted with the thing itself, and are considered to be constituted by the joint work of the thing itself and [subjectivity].
