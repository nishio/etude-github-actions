[Granovetter's [strength of weak ties] is that [novel] information often comes in via [weak connections] like friends of friends or people you haven't seen in a while, rather than strong connections like family or colleagues.

If you look for [weak ties strengths] and similar structures between concepts and symbols, it means that in discovering "[new connections]," it's more likely to happen via weak connections rather than strong connections such as well-known textbook structures.
The well-known, textbook "connections" are already [commoditized] and have no new value. If you want to create something new and rare, you have to follow and find the weakest connections yourself. [That's the serendipity of binge reading.

An example of a new discovery by projecting in a different space by [analogy].
