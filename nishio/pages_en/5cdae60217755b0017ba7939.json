Add a new property to the window with TypeScript
If I do `window.db = db;` to expose the variable db for debugging purposes, I am told "window doesn't have that property".
It looked like I could declare it with Quick Fix, so I did and it added db : any to the interface Window definition in lib.dom.d.ts. I hate this because I will definitely forget to change it back later.
In TypeScript, declarations are generally merged. So you don't have to edit them directly.
code:typescript
 declare global {
     interface Window { db: any; }
 }
 window.db = db;

このglobalはは[Module Augmentation]の一種、Global augmentationだ。see [Declaration Merging · TypeScript https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html]

code:typescript
 declare module "./modulename" {
     interface Foo { Bar: Baz; }
 }

The "global" is added to mean "do not define a new Window in the module in which this declaration is written, but merge it with the global Window.
