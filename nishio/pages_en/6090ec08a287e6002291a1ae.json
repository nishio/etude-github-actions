 *1315530110* 5-day photo reading test, part 3
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110907/1315358107'>Try the 5-day photo reading test</a>, <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/ nishiohirokazu/20110908/1315442582'>Continuing with #2</a>. The day before yesterday I was at Burger King, yesterday I was at Lenoir, and today I'm at St. Mark's, but St. Mark's is cold. Also, there are toddlers on both sides of the street looking at me! It's distracting!
 
 Now for today's flow.
 -Day 4: Preparation→Photo→Vertical reading→X reading→Consider questions
 But I used up a lot of time in vertical reading. Instead of "making questions on the fourth day," as scheduled, I had already made questions on the first three days, so this time I had a lot of work to do to solve them. The question is whether "classification of personality structure" and "dream diagnosis" are scientifically meaningful or not.
 
 The first interesting point about Freud's personality structure is that he tried to classify personality as a system rather than individual characteristics, and there are four: oral love = acceptance, oral love = sadism, anal love = sadism, and genital love. And these are, in essence, the developmental stages of "what you want is given to you," "what you want must be taken from you," "what you want must be protected from being taken from you," and "the adult who has transcended these stages. Isn't Fromm's model unnecessarily complex because he is too hypothetical, per Freud's theory assuming that all of these personalities are derived from sexual desire? He has a lot to say about the influence of the environment based on his research on indigenous cultures and so on.
 
 Then, with regard to dream diagnosis, it is well constructed as a non-contradictory system, and in Fromm's opinion, "it is a working hypothesis. However, he feels that even if it is true that "many dreams are symbolic fulfillment of desires," Freud's assumption that "all dreams are" is a dogmatic hypothesis.
 
 Others are unhappy that love is treated in Freud's context as a mere selfish "action for one's own gratification" that is "undermining love". This is from Fromm's "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4314005580/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=4314005580">That I Love</a>" is also piled up at home, so I will read it after I finish this book. Personally, I think it's a useful concept for understanding human desire fulfillment behavior in Freudian materialism, if we can create a new term of art instead of calling it "love".
