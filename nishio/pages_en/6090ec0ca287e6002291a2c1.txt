 *1380942864* Are "tool-obsessed engineers incompetent"?
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Yamashiro0217/20131004/1380855545'>Comparing programming work to chess - Diary of Yamashiro0217</a>
 
 The importance of "reducing the burden of thinking" is a point that I emphasized in the <a href='http://nhiro.org/kuds2013/'>lecture material</a> that I recently published. Humans have created tools, languages, and methodologies to enhance their abilities. The direction should be right.
 
 
 On the other hand, a response to this entry: <a href='http://anond.hatelabo.jp/20131005004542'>Engineers who are concerned with tools are usually incompetent</a>.
 
 >>
 The people who work for world-class companies such as Google and others I admire are good at what they do, but their performance does not suffer because of differences in tools or environments.
 <<
 
 You say, "I'm good at what I do, but I don't lose performance because of the tools I use.
 
 
 I wonder if what he meant to say was "great people have high performance even when they are using tools they are not good at". If so, what is he comparing 'high' to? I wonder if he is picturing in his brain "an engineer who is particular about tools but has low performance.
 
 But that's a bias. A person who is particular about his tools is a person whose only appeal is "being particular about his tools," in other words, a person who has not produced any results. A person who is producing results would focus on appealing to his results, right? Therefore, there is a bias that it is easier to observe an "engineer who is obsessed with tools but not producing results" than an "engineer who is obsessed with tools but producing results.
 
 Therefore, I think it is appropriate to say that his claim "engineers who are obsessed with tools are usually incompetent" is "engineers whose only appeal point is their obsession with tools are usually incompetent.
 
 
 I disagreed with his assertion, but I understand how he feels. When I do interviews, people ask me to show them what kind of keyboard I use, but I'm not a big fan of keyboards, at most I use English letters. I've been using a Thinkpad since high school and loved the keyboard and trackpoint, but I switched to a MacBook when it became a Lenovo and haven't felt any problems with it. I'm not a fan of the "engineers should be particular about their tools" mentality. Of <a href='http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html'>tools and languages and methodologies</a>, I think it's unbalanced to think only about the visible tools.
 
 Now, I'm an incompetent engineer whose back hurts after sitting in a pipe chair for a long time, so I <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001ANBTYM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=B001ANBTYM&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Tempur PC Seat Wedge Cushion</a> and I will leave you.

 <body>If you put a top-notch professional musician on any instrument, he or she will play first class, but for stage performances and recordings, he or she will use a particular instrument. <br>I think you are describing two events in different situations like that. </body>

 <body>It's not a rebuttal because the situations are different. </body>

 <body>I'm on the fringes of a design shop where a different mouse slows my work down. <br>I'm not one to memorize shortcuts, so I assign them to buttons on the mouse and keyboard</body>.
