 >[Nietzsche]'s central concept in his critique of Christianity, meaning "resentment" or "envy".
 > In "[Moral Genealogy]" (1887), Nietzsche traced the origins of Christianity to the Jews' lusantiman against the Romans, and the essence of Christianity to a distorted value evaluation born of lusantiman.
 > The Jews, the ruled class, harbored resentment and envy toward the Romans, the ruling class, for their strength, active enjoyment of life, and self-affirming nature, and out of this resentment they created a refracted value evaluation: the strong are "bad" and I, the not-strong, am "good".
  #Self-affirmation
  #Monarchical morality and slave morality
 > Nietzsche believed that this value shift was further refracted and led to the value evaluation that it is "good" to be weak, to deny desire, and to not enjoy real life, as represented by the phrase "[Blessed are the poor]," which eventually led to the Christian idea of [original sin], [asceticism], [negation of this life Nietzsche believed that this led to the Christian idea of [original sin], [asceticism], and [negation of this life].
