 *1265777859*Tale of drinking a tooth filling and throwing up.
 I had been eating, and had a filling come off, clack, repack, and repeat several times, and I thought it was supposed to clack when it came off. A few hours before going to the dentist, I was eating a cream bun because I was hungry and suddenly realized that the filling was missing!
 
 I took a deep breath and looked around for a while, but there was no way I would leave something as small as a stuffing around (because it would disappear quickly), so I could only assume that it was in my stomach if it was not in a place where I could quickly see it!
 
 Anyway, I got a basin and put my fingers down my throat, but nothing came out but gulping. Is it because I just have bread in my empty stomach? and drank about 500 cc of water and tried again. Now that I think about it, I think I lost my cool around this point. When my mouth was above my stomach, I could only get water that I had just drank. After the water had been coming out for a while, I finally understood the situation and tried again, sitting upright on the toilet seat with my head below my stomach. Finally, after about three tries, I found something hard and crunchy. Whew. I'm tired...
 
 But it was a good lesson. When I vomit, I put my head down. The back of my throat felt interestingly soft and fluffy. If you force yourself to throw up a lot, you will get blood phlegm. Stuffing is not always called gari, he said.
