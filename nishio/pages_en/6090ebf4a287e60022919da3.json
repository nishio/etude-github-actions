 I think it would be good if woopsdez's "Seminar Information Sharing Calendar" or yoichiro's "Komisuke" were more widely used.
 
 I personally don't like wikis", so I've made an elaborate registration system for Django Study Groups, where the first-come-first-served basis is clear. There are a lot of issues, such as the application page not being mobile-friendly, but it's easy to manage.
 Also, we all try to make sure that participants do not leave without talking to anyone.
 
 I have always wanted to lower the threshold for participation, and I think it is important to have people like Shibata-san who can dig people out, and I would like to have a mechanism to organize knowledge to promote such gatherings.

 It's important to make sure that participants don't leave without talking to anyone. I am a shy person, so when I go to conferences away from home, I tend to be pretty quiet.
 It would be better to have a clear first-come, first-served rule for registration. It would be easier for those who could not make it to the event to say, "Well, it was too late, so I guess it can't be helped.

 I think it might be better to use a wiki for all but the critical parts, because the administrative costs are lower. Also, it would be very nice to have a chat room attached to Lingr or IRC. It is very different from "Nice to meet you" to "We have talked a lot in the chat room, but it is nice to meet you offline".

 The difficulty level of finding out about the existence of the desired community is quite high for those who are not familiar with it.
 It is high.
 
    KOMUSUKE has been working to make the activities of the community known to as many people as possible.
 and to help manage the community itself.

 --------
 
 ↑I summarized it for now, but I wonder if this kind of thing should be managed in a wiki or something, instead of just summarizing it transiently in a blog. It seems that amachang is currently creating a CGI for the management of the "Reveal Yourself Group" (and it is scheduled to be committed to CodeRepos), but I wonder if we should take this opportunity to start a wiki for collecting and organizing information.
 
 --------
 
 issue
 - How to apply
 -- Do you collect email addresses?
 -- "Create an account and apply" or
 -- "Trackback to Sign Up" or
 --- I don't want to be dependent on Hatena's services.
 
 - How do we deliver it?
 -- By default, "Stream via Ustream. High quality video will be uploaded to GoogleVideo later. Your presentation will be posted on the Wiki." And only those who don't like it can reject it.
 -- Technical know-how on video recording
 
 - How to announce
 -- Announcement on amachang blog fills up in an instant.
 -- interested parties register their email address and new events are announced by email?
 -- But is it still biased toward heavy users?
 -- Should we create a "new people quota"?
 
 - How to make it interesting
 -- If it's really a "presentation by someone who is not used to presenting" for the entire 4 hours, does it get messy?
 -- It's not good when people who are attending and it's their first time at a conference like this think, "Oh, it's just a bunch of crap." and disappointed with the conference itself.
 -- Should there be one or two lectures at a time by people who have been there before?
 -- I don't want to fix that "able-bodied lecture" either.
 --- Create a "phone shocking" slot for a presentation with an introduction by the person who made the presentation?

 There are a hundred people here!

 I wonder if it is necessary to have at least one faculty member or student from the University of Dentsu... I'm sure there are plenty of other venues that are large enough for an academic.

 But I am also troubled by the idea that consistently repeating small conferences of 30 people each might not be a bad idea.
 
 *1197458067*Proposal that regulars be drawn by lot.

 20:12 (yusukebe) How about selecting presenters by lottery lang:ja
 20:13 (nishio) It might be a good idea to have a lottery for those who have presented at Shibuya.* or LL* for the second time or later > yusukebe
 <<
 Maybe they could decide on something like "two previously announced quotas," and then regulars could be drawn by lot.
 
 *1197459878* Problems when conference size grows.
 - I can't remember all their faces.
 - Even if each person introduced themselves in 30 seconds, it would take 50 minutes, which is impossible.
 - Difficult to pick up on people who are left out of the loop.
 - Hard to keep track of who is coming and who is not.
 - Making nametags for 100 people is also difficult (though I probably won't make them).
 -- I think it would be okay to make it if it was a smallish type.
 - It's hard to find a restaurant that can accommodate everyone at a get-together.
 
 Disadvantages of small-scale systems
 -Will soon be filled to capacity
 
 
 If the membership limit is set at 30 members, the cost will be significantly reduced since each meeting can be held at Cybozu Labs. On Saturdays and Sundays, the bars around Akasaka are empty.

 Also, DISable is a word I've never heard of before in this reference, what's the original?

 The word "DIS" is already a code word that can only be used internally.

 Nice to meet you. My name is shino, and I am a dandist at an event called "WikiBana". I would like to do something to gather the know-how of those who organize events. I'd like to share information about the venue, and also the problems and hesitations of those who have organized an event.
 It is an announcement of participation on the Wiki, but the cancellation rate on the day of the meeting is close to zero, and the attendance rate is very good (for a group of 20 to 40 people). Do you think that being part of the co-editing team from the time you join makes you more aware of your participation? I would like to hear from other communities who are using the wiki as a roster. As for the waiting list, it is true that the timing of the "we have a cancellation and are looking for more people" announcement may make the first-come, first-served basis a little less fair, but so far I have not received any complaints about it. I would recommend it.
 There is an offline study group called "Java Reading Group" which has been held more than 100 times. I think this is an example of a group that is running well with two administrators.
 <<
 
 Oh, I am quite relieved to see an example of something that is not impossible to do 100 times!
 Fortunately, amachang and I are the same age and work for the same company, so I think it will be easy for us to work together.
 
 ----------
 
 In the meantime, I am wondering if it is okay to create a wiki.

 id:SiroKuro 
 >>
 If possible, I would like to see a lottery instead of first-come, first-served when there are too many people. People who don't belong to such a community will be at a huge disadvantage.
 <<
 
 Indeed. I think I just had a conversation with amachang about the possibility of people registering multiple times.

 The first thing I was trying to do was
 
    1. not closed
    2. to be made public
 
 That's all.
 <<
 
 I see.
 
 ----------
 
 Both amachang and I are very tired, and amachang was talking about building a system over the weekend, but how about just setting up a wiki somewhere for now?
 
 *1197467675* It's already 11:00.
 Let's go home.
 
 Also, when I think about it calmly, I am not good at places where there are many people. I am aware of this once again.
 
 ----------
 
 Also, I can't go to the 1981 year-end party because it conflicts with other things I have to do.
 
 I will go to the unexplored off-site meeting.
 
 *1197468993* woo.
 
 I'm exhausted. I guess I'm not suited for this kind of thing.

 <body>I think one important factor is how to set up the physical venue. <BR>Will we use the same venue each time for clarity, or will we change the venue each time to add to the fun? If the venue is to be changed, how much of a geographical area should be covered? Well, for those who organize the event, it would be easier to have a fixed venue. </body> <br><br><br>Are we going to change the venue every time?

 <BODY>If we are talking about a meeting. After all, I think organizers of any meeting can fall into that kind of feeling. Especially during the period between the open call for applications and the event. Many times, I have gone back and forth between the feeling of "I can do it! and "I can do it!" and "I've started something like this, aha! I think that is the loneliness of the organizer. That's why it is really important to have two admins in a team. I also think it would be great if we could establish some kind of horizontal connection among organizers, where we could encourage each other and share our know-how. <br>I am not able to participate, but I am supporting this event. </body> <br><br>I am not able to participate, but I will support you.

 <body>What about LT presentations + a standing buffet party? <br>I wonder if the problem of faces, handles, and real names not matching can be solved by voluntarily taking a commemorative photo of about 3 people at a time<br>If the management makes it a "regular thing". </body>
