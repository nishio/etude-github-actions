Referential Communication and Category Acquisition
Markman, A.B. and Makin, V.S., 1998. Referential communication and category acquisition. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 127(4), p.331.
 [the need to establish reference] in communication also influences [category coherence]
 	This proposal was tested in 2 studies involving a 
 	referential communication task
 	consistency was promoted between individuals by communication
		which synchronized the category structures of different people
	Further, people were focused on the commonalities of objects and on the differences related to the commonalities by communication--a pattern that is compatible with what has been observed in existing categories.
