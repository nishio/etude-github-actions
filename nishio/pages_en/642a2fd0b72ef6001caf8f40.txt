People who interpret corrections as mounting
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642345185777688577] People who interpret minor [corrections] as "[mounting]", simply [a pain in the ass], and most people "don't want to be in [the community]". He thinks, but he doesn't realize it and thinks, "Isn't it detrimental to the growth of the community to offend my [mood]?" (This is a general statement, not an air rip).

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642346536846909443] I used to collect this kind of [toxic mentality] by calling it "[old age]", but apparently I don't think the correlation with [old age] is that strong. Maybe "low [self-esteem]" is the main factor, and the decline of ability due to [aging] is just one of the factors. So it happens even if you are young.
