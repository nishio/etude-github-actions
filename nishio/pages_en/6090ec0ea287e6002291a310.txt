 *1420710181*Tried field adaptation of KyTea.
 I decided to use KyTea because I had inadvertently installed MeCab in EUC by mistake and lost tension.

 ** single-byte slash
 
 Error if raw corpus contains /. Replaced with full-width characters.
 
 ** clean
 
 I had trouble figuring out what to delete when changing the raw corpus and starting over. it looks like I should delete work/* and save/*.
 
 ** about 1 min.

 ./makemodel.sh  0.00s user 60.86s system 99% cpu 1:01.09 total

 The quantity is about this much

 $ wc data/target-train.raw
   48320   25084 4336657 data/target-train.raw

 ** Example
 
 - |Ha-ha-ha! S-|
 - I also found a typographical error: I cried in the train! I was crying in the car!
 - KyTea: I'm wondering if it's "name + san" or just one word by itself! 3 people
 
 ** about 22 minutes
 
 22 minutes to annotate 100 cases
 
 The " \! is still there, and he gets upset that I haven't finished annotating it yet. I erased it.
 
 I forgot to erase the blank space and get angry with Double Boundary.
 
 When I open the file in the editor and modify it, I spend a lot of time looking for where the part to be modified is on the screen with my eyes, so it would be easier if I could center the edited part with a little JS and line it up so I can annotate it with HJKL.
 
 ** Badly formatted
 
 I was upset when I got a "Badly formatted" message without line number information, but it was just a blank line in the middle of a line by accident.
 
 ** clean
 
 When I modify the annotation and start over, I get an error message "save/001.wann already exists! but this is an empty file created at the time of the last failure, so I want to delete it on my own.
 
 
 ** Second study: still about 1 minute.
 
 Cutting fan heaters with fans and heaters? Do you want to cut an intern with an in and a turn? He asked. Interesting.
 
 It took me 20 minutes to get used to annotating.
 
 ** Summary
 
 KyTea's response is interesting.
