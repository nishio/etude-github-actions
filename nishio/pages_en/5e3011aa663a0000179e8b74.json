Follow the link to KJ method
In [The Problem of Too Large Links], we considered how to "automatically" reduce the size of links that are too large.

If you don't want it to be automatic, you could just import the pages in the link into Regroup and do the [KJ method].

If you want to write back to Scrapbox based on that information, think about what to write back.
