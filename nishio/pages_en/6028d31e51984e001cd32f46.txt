Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 3
I received the parts I ordered, so I'm going to copy [1x4 Curved Slope Leg Tachikoma].

leg
　I didn't have a blue plate 1×1, so I used transparent orange to make it flashier.

hand (of cards)

 The joint at the base does not appear to be this one, but I don't know what it is.

　　　　Oh, I thought it was a clip coming out of the top, but [LEGO: handle] is sandwiched between [round plate] from the top and bottom.
　Heads of side stud blocks face the root side, but cones the other way around.
　　Inverted by pin.

　　I changed the position of the pin, is this better?

　At first I didn't realize the top half was through and thought there were three 30 degree slopes.
　　I didn't know how to fix it, so I wrote on Twitter and they told me.

　　But I'm still not sure how to fix all three eyeballs in this small space.
　　[https://gyazo.com/d58bee366131a482cee31d8f382138bf]
 　　You can't put a [T-bar] on the side in this state, it will hit the T-bar at the back.
　　[https://gyazo.com/64268944fd6c29eae3048aa6950fb6b1]
 　　Another side stud would cause the left and right T's to collide.

　Forgot to buy blue dish and sticks.
　[https://gyazo.com/ae054e4b9e52f33f9014fed98beea174]
　This looks good on the outside, but how the heck do you fix it?
　　[https://gyazo.com/15614e53df4afb1e97d6fa78bf4983da]
　　It's not impossible...

 Carry side handle
 　[https://gyazo.com/ff1343297938e69d7981718a3b55d77e]
　　I tried putting it on the side of the side stud block because the dish wouldn't stick against the top of the 2x2, but this doesn't add up.
　　　[https://gyazo.com/8aff52122a6d40662303be6f40cbc14a]
　　　Oh, right, [center stud].

　　　Write a description and notice the solution.

　I made the mistake of forgetting to buy a blue 1×1 slope (ugh).
　[https://gyazo.com/dcc45e465954db93ef8ae81f4bc069e0]
　It looks good at first glance, but when compared to the original, it is very different.
　　[https://gyazo.com/5cd5fe5cb0cabcc895b9045e6c9501ee]
　　Tiles stick out compared to the original.
　　The original does not appear to have a difference of one panel in the red round.
　　　These two are in essence saying that the middle four rows are sticking out too far, or should I change them to brackets?
　　　　[https://gyazo.com/1fc24843c345a7842477f2188e0711e1]
　　　I switched to brackets and it got better.
　　Side 1 x 4 curved ramps lower than original
　　　This is due to the low stud position of the side studs
　　　On the other hand, brackets would leave a horizontal gap.
　　　[https://gyazo.com/28df5b379d6d0b117958691c11dab51f]
　　　　Good height, but gaps in lateral direction
　　　Oh, right, this is due to the fact that you're using the second side stud, so just use the first one.
　　　 At the time of the photo, the red round was being supported by the first side stud, so it was the second.
　　　 [Comparison of two brackets and side studs].
　　　 　[https://gyazo.com/1b6df3854e3a4ff81247b7f3d40a191b]
　　　　Hmmm, now there's a gap here...

TODO What to buy
　gilding the lily
　[Dish 2 x 2]
　https://www.brickers.jp/?pid=39378968
　Blue stick (what's your name?)
　[Antenna 4H]
　https://www.brickers.jp/?pid=57253623
　Blue 1 x 1 plate
 Blue 1 x 1 slope: sold out
　Blue 1 x 6 plate
　Blue 2 x 2 center studs 3 pcs.
　　If you use it at the base of the hand, you have 2 degrees of freedom.
　　This would be a simpler solution.
　　　https://www.brickers.jp/?pid=103967900
　I wonder if this could be used to make a three-fingered hand.
