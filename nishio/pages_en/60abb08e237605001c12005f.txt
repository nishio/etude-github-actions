axiology
from [reason for "correctness"].
axiology
　[categorical imperative].
　　Should be done regardless of conditions.
　　'A murderer was chasing his friend and hid his friend. What if the murderer said, 'Did you hide him?' ?"
　　Kant: "I shouldn't lie, so I should answer, 'I hid it.'"
　　　'The victim is not harmed by the telling of the truth, but chance causes harm.'
　　　[Principle of dual results].
　　Obligations do not conflict in the first place.
　　　If your duty is "don't lie," then you don't lie.
　　　If your duty is to "save lives," then lie and save lives.
　　　If you think it's wrong to rationalize the loss of life without lying in this situation, then you have an obligation to "save lives without lying."
　[Personality as an objective]
