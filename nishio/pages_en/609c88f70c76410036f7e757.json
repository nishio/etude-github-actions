効率性と平等性
>Taro Kono, Minister of State for Administrative Reform, apologized on a TBS program on the evening of January 12 for the flood of reservations for inoculation of the elderly with the new coronavirus vaccine, saying, "Many local governments placed more importance on the equality of residents than efficiency. This is completely my fault," he apologized.
>He also mentioned the procedure for approval of vaccines by countries. The government approves vaccines according to the same rules as in normal times, which is vulnerable to emergencies. The government must change as well," he said, stressing the importance of a flexible response to emergencies.

　I had to strongly urge them to "phase out the vaccination tickets."
　I should have said more strongly, "Don't be in a hurry" and "You'll hit it."
　Vaccination operations vary depending on the number of people to be vaccinated, so we thought it appropriate to leave it up to each municipality.
　Perhaps because they are in contact with residents on the front lines, many municipalities placed more value on [equality] than [efficiency].
　This is my failure.
In other words, by not telling them in advance to "issue vaccination tickets in phases," the local government accepted reservations all at once instead of in phases, and this "not telling" was a failure, he said.
