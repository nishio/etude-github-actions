Tool Culture Issues
A derivative of the [human bug] that, when something is successful, attributes the cause of that success to something easily observable.

When there is an observed fact that a community has successfully managed an event by using a certain method with a certain tool, we tend to attribute the cause of success to the tool or method because the tool or method is easy to observe.

Culture (the distribution of individual values) is often overlooked because it is difficult to observe, but is often a prerequisite for tools and methods to be utilized.
