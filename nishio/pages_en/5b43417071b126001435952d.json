KJ method and resolution

 I looked at the 225 book titles organized, and I knew the monitor was too small for this kind of thing.
 I wish the time would come when the floor is a 2m * 2m touch panel that can be stepped on.

 I have a script that prints at 25up on A4, and by cutting with scissors, the size of the sticky note is approximately 35mm * 50mm. I am thinking of printing on business card sheets in the future because it is a pain to cut them, but that would increase the size by 1.5 times, so the space required would also increase by 1.5 times.
 I guess I'll just have to do something about it by zooming and scrolling on the monitor.
 I suspect that the projector does not have enough resolution (dozens of letters are written on a 35mm * 50mm card placed in a 2m * 2m space, so if each letter is 2.5mm and that's 10 pixels, 40 pixels is 1cm, so 200cm would be 8000 pixels.
 I want a large house where I can leave sticky notes all over the place all the time and not have a problem.
 Do it on the ceiling.
 Or a wall, or a wall-to-wall whiteboard?
