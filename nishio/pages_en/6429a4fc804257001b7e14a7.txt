"[There's] no such thing as a crappy job, just [crappy people] who don't want to do it."
Gentlemen who profess to want to destroy generators while keeping the lights on.
	That's a line that still works today, even though the novel was written half a century ago! (People haven't progressed much...)

Volume 1: Emotionally charged and moved by the project's accomplishment
Volume 2: Hate Against Society Rises
Volume 3: Mystery Solving
As for the romance factor, there are pros and cons.
　Well, I think this element makes it a polyphonic harmony.
　I'm not so sure I can relate to it, personally.

I've been reading it for a while now, and I think it's a classic that I should read now.

It's a good book, but long.
