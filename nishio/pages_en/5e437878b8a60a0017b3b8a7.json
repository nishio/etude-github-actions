Visualizing What You Don't Know
> "[Knowledge that I know I don't know]" adjacent to new knowledge is a deficit link in the Scrapbox sense.

>I feel Scrapbox's deepness of spirit in the way it mixes in what it knows, while clearly stating "I don't know", and then allows the user to decide whether or not to expand on that knowledge. This is originally a method of expression for wikis.
　>Yes, [red link] is indeed a clarification of what "I don't know". A door to knowledge that leads outside.
　 >Wikipedia, it was simply a sign of "no entry", but when brought into a personal wiki, it becomes an expression of something "unknown", and it plays an exquisite role. And it is also a door that encourages awareness to "expand".
　 　I see, I have long wondered why it is good for individuals to have their own wikis, and I am convinced that visualizing "things that we know exist but don't yet know much about" works to inspire us to "expand and learn".

　This is another one of those [things you don't know that you don't know that you can visualize].

I'm happy when [red link] becomes [blue link] because I can now unexpectedly understand what I didn't understand.
　On this page itself, I scrapped a tweet I saw that looked useful, titled "Visualizing what you don't know", and then I remembered "Sharing what you don't know" and added it, and the link was "Scrapbox is good for studying", and in it was the red link "Visualizing what you don't know. visualize what you don't know" was there.
