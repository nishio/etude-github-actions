The obsession with output in the form of writing
	The author shows the Scrapbox page to others only after the author has determined that the page has "reached a level of perfection" that can be shown to others.
	[Observation bias] makes you assume that everything is on a page like that.
	I feel like that sentence of perfection will be written from the very beginning.
	That's not possible.

	　When it was first written, it was only the first three lines.
	　After that, I thought, "It's hard for people who have no experience in Go to understand what I'm talking about," so commentary was added
