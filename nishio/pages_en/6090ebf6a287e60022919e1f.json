 *1207971207*A grammar that produces multiples of 3

 12:12 (nishio) I understand now
 12:12 (nishio) I missed the "num ->" part
 
 
 12:13 (nishio) being a multiple of 3 is too obvious to be interesting
 12:13 (nishio) Is the question whether arbitrary multiples of 3 can be represented?
 12:14 (nishio) If "the first two are arbitrary multiples of 3" as Misho says, then obviously arbitrary multiples of 3 cannot be expressed.
 
 
 12:14 (nyaxt) I'm not sure
 12:14 (nyaxt) num in any binary number.
 12:14 (nyaxt) num 0 is the number of the multiplication of san?
 12:15 (nishio) num -> 11 | 110 | num 0 | num num num
 12:15 (nishio) It wouldn't make sense without the omitted "num ->".
 12:16 (nishio) num is 11 or 110 or ...
 12:16 (nishio) and since it is easy to show that num 0 and num num num are multiples of 3 when num is a multiple of 3
 12:17 (nishio) It is obvious that all generated numbers are multiples of 3
 
 
 12:17 (nyaxt) because num 0 = num * 2?
 12:17 (nishio) Yeah.
 12:17 (nyaxt) num num?
 12:17 (nyaxt) same land area
 12:17 (nyaxt) I understand.
 12:18 (nishio) num num = num * (2 ** (k + 1) + 1) when k is the number of digits in num
 
 
 12:19 (nishio) I'm not sure if you can represent any multiple of 3 if you take the first two numbers well
 12:19 (nishio) I have a feeling you can't do it.
 
 
 12:20 (nishio) how would you describe 1001 (oh)
 12:20 (nyaxt) Right.
 12:21 (nishio) So we just need to find a counterexample where 11 | 1001 | num 0 | num num num cannot produce any multiple of 3?
 12:21 (anemo) 33 (0b100001) can't be expressed
 12:21 (nishio) I can't.
 12:21 (nishio) == == done ==
 
 
 12:21 (nyaxt) Bye!
 12:21 (nyaxt) Add rule.
 12:22 (nyaxt) What if we add a 1 0*n 1 thingy?
 12:22 (nishio) Maybe 11100. Maybe the multiple of 3, 11100...0001, will be present.
 12:22 (nishio) Not maybe.
 
 
 12:24 (nishio) For any integers n and m, the remainder divided by 3 with m or more zeros after n is 2
 12:25 (nishio) So there are m (m - 1 0s) multiples of 3 of the form 1.
 12:25 (nishio) And this can't be expressed by changing the above rule slightly w
 12:26 (nyaxt) I understand.

 I thought that Twitter is not a good place for discussion.
 
 *1207978397* Heading to Mr. Bullet's house.
 
 I forgot to write down my brother Nishio's contact information.
 
 P.S. I'm on the Kiyosumi-Shirakawa Oedo line platform as of 35 minutes.

 -Chemistry of Wii Athletes Expected to Occur at Bullet Kogan's Home on April 12 - ITmedia Enterprise

 It looks like they are warming up now. w They are going to broadcast it on Ustream, so please stay tuned.
 
 Ustream coverage is here: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/makeplex
 
 *1208010219*Jython pronunciation
 The majority reads "Jayson", and there are a few who read "Jayson" as a remnant of the old JPython (but I don't recommend it because it is indistinguishable from JSON when pronounced by Japanese), and there are some who read "Yayson" in Dutch (lol).
 
 Well, I guess the way to read it in Japan is "jaison"...

 Footbath.
 
 *1208015248*[Emacs] keyboard macros
 Press "C-x (" to start recording. C-x )" to end recording. C-x e" executes the most recent one, and "e" can be pressed to execute continuously. If you know in advance how many times to repeat, you can repeat 100 times with "C-100 C-x e".
 
 You can display macros recorded with "M-x insert-kbd-macro". A real example:
 >|lisp|
 (setq last-kbd-macro
    [?\C-6 ?\C-d down])
 ||<
 
 Looks like "delete 6 characters and go down" is recorded like this. Since this is just Lisp code, you can edit it and "C-x C-e" at the end to load the edited version.

 <body>I didn't realize there was such an exchange behind the scenes. <BR>By the way, the original story is a Dragon Book exercise. </body>
