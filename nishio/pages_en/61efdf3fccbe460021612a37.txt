The average group is not always the majority.

The center is [average].
Population density is higher near the center. (more people per unit area).
But [the perimeter has a larger area],
The number of people living on the periphery is larger.
The [average group] is not necessarily the [majority].

----- Conversation that triggered
When [values are diverse], [weirdos are in the majority].

Q: Then the [oddballs] of the land are now [normal people]!

No, there is a difference between having a large number of people and being [normal].
	Normal here means [average].

Q: Is the image of the convexity of the distribution flattened?

That distribution, I think you're thinking in one-dimensional space,
For example, when a 3-dimensional sphere is divided in half by distance from the center, the outer half is 7 times larger
Mean is in the center.
Even if the number of people per unit volume was greater in the center.
Since the volume of the denominator is larger in the periphery
The "oddballs will be the majority."

To use a more neutral phrase, "the average person becomes a minority."
I have a bias against the words "weird" and "normal.
Weirdo â†’ a person whose [sensor] output is out of line with the average output.
Normal -> average output person
