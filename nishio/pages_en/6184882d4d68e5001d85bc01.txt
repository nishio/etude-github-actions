I sympathize with the direction, but I feel uncomfortable with the expression and am trying to figure out what is causing the discomfort.

After two days of reviewing it, I understand a little more.
　Feeling of drawing a clear boundary between myself and the youth [false dichotomy].

　First, the imaginary Mr. A thinks that "there are young people who 'I can understand and tolerate' and those who are 'inexcusable' and those who are 'not so inexcusable'.
　　Implicitly ignoring or downplaying the values of young people who don't understand them.
　The antithesis to that is that "the latter is the majority."
　　Ignoring the values of young people who don't understand will leave them with old values.
　What bothered Nishio was that this discussion dichotomized the set of "youth" into "those that can be understood" and "those that cannot be understood."
　　In reality, understanding is a gradient
