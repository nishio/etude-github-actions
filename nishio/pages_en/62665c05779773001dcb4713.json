Getting advice from parents is not a cheat.

Getting advice from parents is not a cheat.
	I reacted when I saw the expression "the cheat of getting advice from parents."
	Getting advice from parents is not a bad idea.
	You can get advice from anyone, whether it's a teacher, a senior at your part-time job, or anyone else.
	It's not like a school written exam, you don't have to think alone.
	But don't let the adults around you get the better of you.
		When you get good, it's not "your project".
	You have to take your own initiative to choose the best advice.
	I don't think we should adopt a project whose theme is determined by the parents.
		It is harmful when parents experience their children being controlled and awarded as they see fit.
		I think it should be strictly dismissed so that the parents don't have to experience success.
		You're putting a lot of emphasis on [spontaneity].
	Public Offering [open call for applications with emphasis on spontaneity].
