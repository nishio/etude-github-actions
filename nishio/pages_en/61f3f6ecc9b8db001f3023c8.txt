Excellence requires polishing
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Excellence of any kind requires some [polishing].
XII [Nature and Art].

Materials and Craftsmanship There is no beauty that is not decorated, no excellence that is not savage unless it is supported by artifice: this corrects the evil and improves the good. Nature rarely gives us the best. Without it, the best of nature's temperament is uneducated, and without training, half of any excellence would be lacking. Without artificial training, everyone has something unrefined, and excellence of any kind requires some polishing.
