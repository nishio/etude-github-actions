E-books are not searchable boxes
>[eBooks] are also "hacks" that can't be searched from the Internet, and that's the same with many of the unlimited reading services like Kindle Unlimited and O'Reilly Safari, and I had high hopes for Google Books in that regard [src https:// twitter.com/golden_lucky/status/1345936544461246466?s=21]
　This is exactly what I feel like [wasting] time and effort spinning out a sentence and then putting it in a "hackneyed [search] box" that doesn't get any hits.

　The reason why I thought that the book form is not suitable for the atcoder strategy book is because it is important to improve the "ability to get there" including external sites that are linked to the atcoder.
　　It's not impossible to achieve this in the form of an e-book that retains the links, though.

　[It would be a shame not to be able to search.]
