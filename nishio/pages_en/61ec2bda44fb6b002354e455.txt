I can't connect scrapbox projects to each other.
from [/villagepump/scrapbox projects cannot be connected to each other].
Phenomenon caused by the breakup of page connections for each [scrapbox project].

What kind of problem
　You will need to think about where to put the OUTPUT.
　　[elements that block thinking].
　　[private/public split]
　　 I hope this is a positive connection whichever way you write it[/villagepump/takker.icon].
　　 I don't want to be divided in my thinking only by whether it is public or private.
　　Write in [Multiplayer Project] or [Individual Project].
　　　[Parable of the quiet room]
　Cannot use [2 hop link
　Cannot use [reverse link
	Or, to avoid having to separate projects.
 	If we can solve the problem of [words used as different meanings in multiple contexts], we won't have to separate projects unless we need to separate them as public or private.
 	Developing a [transparently handle multiple projects] script would almost solve the problem[/villagepump/takker.icon].

solution
 Put all of them in [Private single project], and make [only a part of private project public] operation.
  As far as [/blu3mo-public] and [/blu3mo] are concerned, it looks like a stable operation[/villagepump/takker.icon].
  Reference: [scrapbox-duplicator][/villagepump/bluemountain.icon].
 UserScript to [handle multiple projects transparently].
  There are only [/villagepump/takker.icon] users, but it is stable and usable with few problems.

   An example of a 2 hop link out of another project starts at about 01:00.
  The input completion is still harried. Fixes will have to wait a bit longer.

Some MERIT is gained by being fragmented, i.e., independent.
