No working on holidays
I saw the expression, "We are an ultra [white company] with a holiday work ban."
It is restricting [the freedom to work on holidays]. It is a company that is taking away [the freedom to choose how to work] from its employees.

For example, if there is an interesting technical event related to work on a holiday and you want to attend, some companies say, "We will treat it as a holiday work and pay you because it is related to work.
It's hard to say "treat my participation in an event as working on my day off" in a company that has a "no working on holidays" rule.
Therefore, employees are under unspoken pressure to take the form of participating in events on their own time off.

relevance
　[Mandatory regular leave also low discretionary status].
　Black or white" is a false dichotomy; in reality, it is a gradation of "freedom in the way you work.
　　Forced to work on holidays (very black)
　　Forced not to work on weekends
　　You may or may not work weekends and weekdays (very white).
