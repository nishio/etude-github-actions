 *1236495788*How to process about once a day on Google App Engine without cron.
 I thought I didn't need to blog about it because I came up with it so quickly, but I was told, "You don't have cron? So I'm writing about it. If you want to use it, please do so at your own risk, knowing full well that it is a stupid bad know-how.
 
 
 If you have a site with a certain amount of access and want to process the data at intervals of about once a day. If the timing of the periodic processing does not need to be strictly at a specific time, you can use the memcached API. If you want to monitor a certain key and do a certain process when it is expiring, and when it is completed, put the value of expire in 24 * 60 * 60 seconds in that key. Of course, if you don't want to use this method, you can use something like "seconds until the next 3:00 am".
 
 
 We want this key monitoring to be kicked as often as possible, but we do not want to irritate users by making the process take a long time. Therefore, we kick it by accessing favicon.ico.

 Easier solution for the socially skilled: "Hey, can you hit this URL in cron?" and tell your friend who has the server
