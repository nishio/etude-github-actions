Fusen size
>It is best for everyone to use whatever stationery they like. However, I know many of you would like to hear specific examples, so here are mine.
>I prefer to use 50mm x 38mm fusens. The pen is a 0.7mm gel ink ballpoint pen.
>Some people may prefer to use 1mm2mm thick felt-tip pens (sign pens/markers) on large labels. I also use a combination of a large felt-tip pen and a thick pen when I put it on a whiteboard for multiple people to see, because writing with a 0.7mm pen is difficult to see at a distance.
>There is another difficulty in doing it with multiple people in addition to doing it alone, and it is important to first get used to using it alone. So it is designed to be lined up on a desk by one person, and the fusen is small and the pen is thin accordingly. This size of the pen can hold 25 labels when placed side by side on an A4 sheet of paper.
