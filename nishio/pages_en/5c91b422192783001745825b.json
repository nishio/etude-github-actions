link to an unexpected destination
It is fun to experience "unexpected linkages" when using [Scrapbox].
When they experience this, they begin to create a lot of "not yet connected links" in the hope that links will unexpectedly connect in the future.
The name "[bracketing]" was invented for this "link-making behavior," but the crucial phenomenon of "unexpected linkage" does not have a name.

I want words to explain that "XXX is fun," "XXX is beneficial to intellectual production," and "that's why we do bracketing, to make XXX happen."

How I came to that conclusion
	Create a page on Scrapbox that mentions other people's slides.
	I think, "Wait, this is a broken link if the service goes out or something, I should keep it on hand."
	Download
	It would be nice to be able to search all these local files at once through Scrapbox's search window."
	I thought, "Wait a minute, isn't the whole 'storing and searching files' thing something that existed before Scrapbox, and Scrapbox's strength is that it connects unexpectedly when you're writing a link?"
	'Let's write it down, not just search for it, xxxx, huh? There's no word?"

memo
	Local files should be able to XXXX as well as search.
	Should be able to bracket PDFs of other people's presentation materials, photos, etc.
	It would be very nice if it could be bracketed into an e-book.
		Even for non-editable subjects, you can record data in the form of a set of permalinks and phrases


	Associative conjunction: [planned contingency].
