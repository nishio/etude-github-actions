The key word is "consultation." New things are created by combining knowledge. We not only try to combine knowledge we already have within ourselves, but also by consulting others who have different knowledge. 3 Consultation

So, to improve your productivity in your future life, 4 increase the number of people you can easily talk to.

This requires two things: first, knowing the recipient's interests and areas of expertise, and second, knowing the recipient's name. If you send an email to a hundred people, the response will be poor because none of the recipients will think it's about them. (Instead, it is important to ask a specific individual, "You know a lot about this, don't you? (Think about it.) Instead, it is important to ask a specific individual, "You know a lot about this, don't you?

Second, imagine receiving an e-mail from a stranger or someone you have just exchanged business cards with at an event, asking for help or guidance, versus receiving the same e-mail from someone who has helped you in the past. Naturally, the latter will be more inclined to help. Pay Forward: Taking the initiative to help will help you in the future.

8Mutually Beneficial CommunityCreating a community that gives grace to each other, this is very important for your own future productivity.

But mutually beneficial communities have weaknesses.9 Weaknesses

[https://gyazo.com/ab8314b4621f9aa12bf6e84b324369aa]
10Different Values

Prisoner's Dilemma 11 Mr. X ＼Y Choice A Choice B Choice A Choice B 2＼2 3＼0 0＼3 1＼1

Maximize the sum of benefits12Mainstream values within a mutually beneficial community are "It is better to increase the sum of benefits" ＼X＼YOption AOption BOption A 2+2=4 0+3=3Option B 3+0=3 1+1=2If everyone chooses Option A, the sum of benefits is maximized, so naturally everyone will choose Option A.

[https://gyazo.com/bb801f58375378d40e2bb1157e1f7718]
The prevailing value within a mutually beneficial community is that "it is good to increase the sum of benefits" and that if everyone chooses option A, the sum of benefits will be maximized, so naturally everyone will choose option A. As a result, everyone will choose option A and the "highly productive state" with the largest sum of benefits will be maintained. As a result, everyone chooses Option A, and a "highly productive state" in which the sum of profits is the greatest is maintained. However, this is only one value system.

14Different Values.

[https://gyazo.com/8af2fc7e7648b48da7bd1249b0cfb4dc]
Prisoner's Dilemma 15There are people in the world with different valuesX ＼Y Choice A Choice B Choice A Choice B 2＼2 3＼0 0＼3 1＼1

[https://gyazo.com/dd02eebbb2399e1344c5a3fae497243d]
Maximize your own profit16There are people in the world who have other values. Think about it from the perspective of Mr. Y. Whether Mr. X takes option A or B is agnostic. And whether he takes option A or B, it is more profitable for him to take option B. Then, rationally speaking, it is correct to take option B, right?

[https://gyazo.com/165d93b3de7f30a2e0705ac32297e322]
Another way to think of it17 is that you are agnostic as to which option the other party will take. Whichever option the other party takes, I am better off with option B. Therefore, I choose option B. When such a person is mixed in a mutually beneficial community, the other members of the community work for free, and the community collapses due to exhaustion. The community will then remain in an "unproductive state" where people choose Option B for each other.

The other person is the bad guy? 18 Various negative labels tend to be applied to this idea, such as "voracious," "con artist," "psychopath without empathy," "egocentric," etc., but that does not solve the problem.

[https://gyazo.com/1badace37e6bc9bb2007f2ed408429fa]
Design based on facts19 -There are people in the world who do not see the value in maintaining a mutually beneficial community -The values of others are not easily changed -We need to create a system based on the assumption that there are such people

[https://gyazo.com/ad8e991e3eebe2a272c3d6cd8e7dd045]
Introduce observer Z. 20 X Y B is not good Z X Y Avoid one-on-one exchanges and introduce observer Z. Z expresses the opinion that choosing option B is a bad idea and incurs a loss of 2 when X or Y choose option B.

24The presence of observers is important for maintaining reciprocity

25 and I wrote about it in the 2011 IPSJ Journal.

[https://gyazo.com/966dae70ad7a524fe1e690ed13cb635a]
I wrote a story about this in a 2011 article...or I wanted to, but there was too little space.26The Binmore story that I twisted into this citation is a story about cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma.

Binmore's Japanese book came out in May of this year27 NTT Publishing [Game Theoretic Foundations of Justice], which explains what we talked about here in about 100 times more detail.

Review 28 -Avoid one-on-one interactions and place observers -Observers declare "no selfish acts" -This discourages selfish acts and increases the sum of productivity!

[https://gyazo.com/4200e0ff02bce682b44c2b4b0e39a8c8]
What could happen to you all in the future29 -Senior entrepreneur says "I'll give you an investment" - "Don't talk to others about your business" -Only one-on-one relationship! Dangerous sign! -Consult a third party with little interest in the business as soon as possible! Ask them to be your "observer"!

Purpose of this slide31 - Create a situation where "Unexplored adopters may be consulting with Unexplored Association" - Create a rumor that "Unexplored Association is a group of people who do not act selfishly" - Create a situation where even selfish people decide "It is risky to duck Unexplored adopters" - -> Unexplored adopters will be less likely to be ducked! Even a selfish person may decide that "it is too risky to duck an unexplored adopter" - Create a situation where "it is too risky to duck an unexplored adopter" - -> Unexplored adopters are less likely to be ducked!
