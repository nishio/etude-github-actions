Weber-Fechner law
>Ernst Weber states that the discrimination threshold of a stimulus (the smallest stimulus difference that can be noticed) is proportional to the intensity of the underlying reference stimulus.

>When the intensity R of a stimulus quantity changes, the corresponding sensory quantity E
> [$ E=C\log R ]
> is the relationship between the two. where C is a constant.
