The Parable of the Fish and the Fishing
	Giving a starving man a fish will only starve him for a day.
 Teach him to fish and he can eat for the rest of his life.
 So instead of giving them fish, we should teach them how to fish.
		[Teach them to fish, not give them fish].

	I'm hungry. Give me some fish."
 We don't give them fish, we teach them how to fish."
 I'm too hungry for that!" #The Parable of the Lumberjacks

	Customers want fish.
 Even if fishing is better in the long run, it is the customer's responsibility not to seek it out
 Should sell fish and make a profit
 	[Sell the hole, not the drill].

	Don't ignore the time cost of catching fish.
 Time in life is limited.
 Time is more valuable than money.
 Even if you can take the time to fish, you shouldn't.
	If it can be bought [outsourced], it should be [outsourced].

	Just because a customer wants fish doesn't mean that what the customer really needs is fish.
 If customers are starving, grains, etc. are preferable.
 	[I need a fast horse.]
