Notes on events related to readings and likes

	Who read the diary and when is shown to the contributor ([mixi]'s [footprint function]).
 	Some approval-hungry users begin to insist that "[not reading] is not good" to those who read but did not comment.
  A way to read diaries without footprints is invented by users.
  Footprint function stopped in June 2011.

	In group chats, it shows who has already read the message (e.g. LINE).
		A culture emerges in which reading but not responding is referred to as "[read-through]."

	One-click response to a user's post is invented (Twitter fav, Facebook like)
		Widely used because it is easier than sending a verbal reply
  It is unclear whether Twitter, which originally released this feature under the name "Favorite," was aware of this usage.
  	Changing the name and icon from Favorite to Like in 2015.

   I'm not sure when the Farovite feature was created, but it was before that, since a Favorite aggregation service called Favstar was created in May 2009.
  Facebook introduced this feature on February 9, 2009
  	FriendFeed seems to have introduced it in 2007 (later acquired by Facebook).
  Many groupware incorporate a "like" function.
  Likes will be used to express that you have read in tools that do not have a read indicator
		Older users like all the posts they have already read on Facebook, etc., which makes younger users feel uncomfortable.
  	Either you misinterpreted the use of "like" to express that you've read it, or you simply think it's all "good".

	Like" diversifies.
 	In 2012, Facebook added "Love", "Haha", "Wow", "Sad", and "Angry".

	Not good.
 	[down vote]
  Slashdot, Reddit, StackOverflow, and others used it as a rating function for posts
  Facebook has a policy of not including a down vote feature.

	Stamp functionality introduced in chat tools.
  Facebook Messenger and other services can return "likes" with a single click.
