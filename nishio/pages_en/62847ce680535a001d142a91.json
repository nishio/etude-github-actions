Scrapbox as a SNS
I have been using Scrapbox for a long time as an "alternative to my personal [blog]," but of course I have also used it as a "place for shared group communication" during that time.
With the recent addition of the [External Links] feature, there is a sense that we have entered a new stage. Networks are now generated between what were previously "individual chunks".
The dispersed communities that have emerged share some members and connect with each other based on the interests of the members, forming a network [after the fact]. This is the birth of an interesting form of [SNS].
