 *1273885579*[OCaml]Triple fast counter
 I forgot. When I created the counter, I decided to inherit it and create a 3x faster red_counter as well.
 >|ocaml|
 # class red_counter=  
     object
       inherit counter as super
       method push = super#push; super#push; super#push; 
     end;;
 Warning S: this expression should have type unit.

 class red_counter : object val mutable count : int method push : int end
 # let rc = new red_counter;;
 val rc : red_counter = <obj>
 # rc#push;;
 - : int = 3
 # rc#push;;
 - : int = 6
 ||<
 Is there a warning if I connect expressions that are not units with a semicolon?
