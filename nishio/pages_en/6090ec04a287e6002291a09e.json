 There used to be a site called "Cow's Beef" that collected "strange Japanese," but it disappeared before I knew it.

 This is a common "ta" derived from "many".

 It's so brilliantly copied that it's laughable. I'm sure they copied and pasted that sentence without thinking about how much that one sentence undermines the customer's benefit.
