Diary 2023-03-09
Yesterday [I connected my Scrapbox to ChatGPT].
Today [/villagepump/Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector] was released.

[/villagepump/linkable Scrapbox with revisions].
[/villagepump/ Scrapbox as an outliner is insufficient].
[/villagepump/Scrapbox is an IDE for thinking].
[/villagepump/AI does the naming chain].
I think the text in [/villagepump/Scrapbox is easy to read for LLMs].
[Digital traces of human attention].
I have a feeling something might come of it, but I don't know what yet.
　Not "Scrapbox now" but "Scrapbox in the future."
