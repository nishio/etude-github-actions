　Thoughts.
　　Assuming they are all 2, the problem is to make up a maximum of N combinations of +1 or +2 for the extra number.
　　A naive double loop will not make it in time.
　　If the remainder is less than or equal to N, just give that number of 1's.
　　If the remainder is more than N, we can make them all 3 and assign the remainder to 4.
　　Constant Order
	Official Explanation
	　It's kind of a totally different story.
　　　If you decide on one, you can do a Tsurugame count, so you search all about one, or you can find out that the old man is 0/1, so you search all about the rest.
　　AC with the above solution without searching.
　　code:python
		 def solve(N, M):
       IMPOSSIBLE = (-1, -1, -1)
       x = M - 2 * N
       if x < 0:
           return IMPOSSIBLE
       if x <= N:
           return (N - x, x, 0)
       x -= N
       if x <= N:
           return (0, N - x, x)
       return IMPOSSIBLE
