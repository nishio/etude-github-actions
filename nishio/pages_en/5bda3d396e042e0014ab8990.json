commodity called cash
	I heard that Dr. Masushima uses the expression "[commodity] called [cash]" in the METI's [Guide for Cooperation between Business Companies and R&D Venture Companies], but I haven't been able to find it.
 It was on the slide.
  [Collaboration between large companies and technology development ventures https://www.slideshare.net/masamasujima/ss-81251408] p.11
 	>Traditional companies may be putting up money, but startups are putting up [technology] and [wisdom], and they're also moving their hands.
  >It would be more fair to say that traditional companies only offer a commodity that is ubiquitous: money.
