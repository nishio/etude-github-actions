 However, for some reason, the 6th presentation by id:nitoyon cannot be downloaded from ustream (connection error occurs when I try to download it in the same way as other videos), so it has not been uploaded. Also, Kamoshita's video is only in the middle of the video. This seems to be an operational error when I changed the position where the face image appears to the right and stopped the recording orz
 
 The distribution facilities and encoding methods are summarized below.

 5 tips to erase hesitation to speak at *1205748646*1000speakers
 http://d.hatena.ne.jp/bash0C7/20080315/1205552157
 
 Very nice story.
 
 >>
 It's hard when you get hit. When they are beaten, they cry. When you are beaten, you lose confidence. When you are hit, your pride is hurt.
 But, well, that's it.
 If I feel like crying, I go home and cry, or in some cases, I go home with a big smile on my face.
 Pride and confidence are not necessarily limited resources, and they will return in time.
 If you think about it calmly, if you fail, you don't lose money, you don't lose your job, you don't get your arm chopped off.
 In short, there is no serious loss if you fail. In fact, there is much to be gained.

 Very nice!
 
 I also thought it was very important not to compare myself with others. Me too. Comparing yourself with others who can write a manuscript with great effort will not help you improve anything. All I can do is to complete the manuscript in front of me. I will do my best.

 I made it in a fit of anger.

 The reason bash0C7's comment is not included is because I wanted to get some words from him after his participation. yukinobu's comment, "But looking back after the event, I realized that this kind of fear is called groundless fear. It's short, but it's very moving. It's something I actually experienced.
 
 I'm sure there were other things, but they didn't come up immediately, so I'm releasing them in alpha. Because "0.1 is not 0".
 
 *1205752868*86 generation development camp
 http://d.hatena.ne.jp/syou6162/20080122/1200936613
 
 I'm very sorry to say this, but...
 
 'Oh, I'm supposed to be in it!' (Yea....
 
 I'll try to jog my memory.
 
 >>
 Around Jan:
 amachang: "Do you want to go to the 86 development camp?"
 nishio: "Well, when?"
 amachang "Around April..."
 NISHIO: "Oh, I'm not scheduled at all!"
 amachang: "Well, I'm going to get married with you.
 nishio "Thanks a lot."
 And oblivion...

 I'm sorry - I'm really sorry.
 I'm sorry to those of the real 86 generation who missed out because of my participation.
 
 *1205758607*Python Quiz [1].
 Python quiz that is not at all useful even if you can answer it.
 >|python|
 >>> def p(x):
 	print x
 	return x
 
 >>> d = {}
 >>> x = 2
 >>> x = d[p(x)] = p(1)
 ?

 ? What will be in the ?

 Python's multiple assignment (x = y = 1) is not (x = (y = 1)) as in C, etc., but is a single statement by itself. The behavior is "first evaluate the right-most side and then put it into the rest in order". So first p(1) is evaluated and 1 is displayed, then after x = 1 is executed, p(x) in d[p(x)] is evaluated and 1 is displayed again. The correct answer is 1,1, which is not the case after being left wondering whether it was 1,2 or 2,1.
 
 *1205762074*Compatibility of twitterfollow.user.js and Japanize
 I have a treasure trove of /lang/javascript/userscripts in CodeRepos.
 http://coderepos.org/share/browser/lang/javascript/userscripts
 Today we're going to take a look at some of them.
 http://coderepos.org/share/browser/lang/javascript/userscripts/twitterfollow.user.js?
 About Grimon, which follows all followers on Twitter created by amachang.
 
 I had been using it conveniently, but for some reason I thought there were a few people who were not being followed. But it doesn't mean they are not functioning.
 Only some people on the first page are not followed.
 
 As it turns out (the title spoils it), when both twitterfollow.user.js and Japanize are installed, Japanize translates the first page before twitterfollow.user.js clicks on the link that twitterfollow.user.js provides. The rest of the pages (depending on the priority of the GM) grab the elements before translation, so they are followed without any problem.
 
 Sudden code reading & debugging was fun.
 
 *1205773143* TMC Japan
 This is a follow-up to the recent SPAM-like serious email from TMC Japan, which sent me an email in English asking if I could meet with them:
 
 >>
 Solicitation call + email from a company called TMC Japan for a new job
 We have already received many of them.

 >>
 Recruitment email from TMC Japan CommentsAdd Star
 English.
 I wonder where they are getting their address collection from.
 <<
 http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kinneko/20080317/p4
 
 I guess they are sending them all over the place after all!
 So I've decided that I'm not going to take them seriously, but now I have to decide whether I'm going to "go through with it completely" or "meet with them and see what they have to say about it for my blog"... (I guess I'm going through with it because it's becoming too much of a pain in the ass.
