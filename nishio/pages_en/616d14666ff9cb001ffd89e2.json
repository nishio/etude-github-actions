tote bag
2021-10-21 My wife told me to replace the tote bag I usually use because it's falling apart, so I thought I'd make one anyway.
2021-11-05 Made.

　Delivery time was 3 weeks, but I received it in 2 weeks.
　Maybe I should make it smaller and tiling...
　I enlarged the main image to fill the main display area and filled the surrounding area with the image for stuffing, but then the image hangs over the bending zone of the cloth
　Gray color should be a little darker in the print-ready data
　　Rather than changing the original image, maybe we could use a tone curve to adjust it.
	I'll use it myself for now, and if it breaks, I'll make the next version.
	Wife: "Stronger than I thought, cheaper than I thought."
	　The pattern is white all the way down to the bottom, so it might show up as dirt."
	　　If you look closely at the tote bags in the world, many of them have darker colors on the bottom.

　　[C3: Computer Created Cats] and then I said, "Having tiles of a fixed size of 512 x 512 is useful for application!"
　　　This version is scaled up and down from the original figure, which is of different sizes, so the line thickness is different.
　　　Layout is easier if written in tiles of integer multiples of 512 x 512 with the same thickness.
　　　I might rather remove the "big picture" that I have trouble placing.
　　　　First, think if you can draw with 512, and if not, think if you can draw with a larger size.
　　I'm sometimes asked to explain each diagram, but it's hard to improvise.
　　　You could create a page in Scrapbox with links to the original page of the image you used and put a QR code in it.
