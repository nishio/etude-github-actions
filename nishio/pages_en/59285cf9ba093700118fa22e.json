blind spot card
The idea is that by typifying the process of human beings noticing [blind spots] and solving them into cards, we can draw cards and solve problems when we are troubled. This is a more abstract version of [TRIZ], which was created by typifying physical patent documents.

We are aiming for a reasonable number of physical cards or pictured mugs in the end, but right now we are in the process of structuring it bottom-up (SEE [top-down and bottom-up]), and we are gradually structuring it by collecting examples where we have noticed blind spots or changed our perspective.

		Last update on 2021-10-22 was an attempt to make [tote bag].
			In the process [a series of pictures of two people saying different things] was born.
			　More and more have been added since then.
			[whether to add a series of pictures of two people saying different things to the blind spot cards?]
			　I won't add all of them, I wrote them on the candidate blind spot card.
		I was trying to make a new addition to [candidate blind spot card] this time and saw this page and added
		　The blind card candidate page is [tasteless] and not good.
		　　It's just a list of links.
		　　What's not good.
		　　　The link alone is not enough information.
		　　　　Is that the same for other blind spot cards?
		　　Why "candidate" in the first place?
		　　　Because I'm anxious to shake the sequential number ID.
		　　　But it's unclear whether everything that's been sequentially numbered in the past is "of a quality that's up to par."
		　　　　[(6.3.1.1) If you don't know who your customer is, you don't know what quality is].
		　　　　　Once you have a clear idea of the specific purpose, such as "to make a tote bag," you can then sift through the criteria based on whether or not it is useful for that purpose.
		　　　　　　[Sift after the use is clear.]
		　　　　　Undecided whether these blind spot cards will be randomly drawn cards as originally planned, or whether they will be readable, tote bags or mugs.
		　　　Then we can look at the candidates and add them if there's no reason not to.
		　　Why did you assign sequential numbers in the first place?
		　　　Because we weren't using Scrapbox when this project started.
		　　　　He felt the name of the card could change.
 			　　　Referencing by name breaks the link when the name is changed.
 			　　　So I tried to refer to it by number.
			　　　Tried to create [a network structure] of knowledge at a time when Scrapbox was not yet in use.
			　　　　It is strongly manifested in the fact that the number one blind spot card is [Tree and Rhizome].
			　　　　We were trying to create [a knowledge rhizome, not a tree of knowledge].
		　　　Can we use Scrapbox now?
 		　　　In the process of translating the Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production into English, I assigned unique numbers to the headings.
 		　　　　Because there are different pages in different languages that point to the same thing
 		　　　　Blind spot cards don't create value only in Japan either, so it's possible they'll be translated into English in the future.
 		　　　　Let's keep the numbers.
		　　[" Look at the candidates and add them if there is no reason not to] "Then let's process them in order from the top of the candidate blind spot cards," I thought and looked at the first one, and it said, "This should be split into several.
		　　 It's a tasteless list, I didn't notice.
		　　 I've split it up and painted a picture, I'll give you some time to make an adoption decision.
		　I'm still having trouble rereading "Blind Spot Cards Without Pictures."
		　　I thought it was "the manuscript of the blind spot card that had no picture at the time it was transcribed to Scrapbox," to be exact.

		　26: [bias of easy drawing].
		　27: [The fastest course is not the fastest].
		　28: [both directions instead of one].
		　Considerations:.
		　　Even if you write "`[blind spot card] candidate`" on the side of the individual page, the link here is too big to be buried.
		　　The trigger for consideration isn't pulled when you think, "I'll consider it later before I put it in."

　　It's been a while since I looked at this one and said, "Where are the 1's and 2's?" I'm like, "Where are 1 and 2?

	　　2 [Top-down and bottom-up].
　　I wonder if there should be a page called "List of Blind Spot Cards."
　　2022-02-16 I think this page is it.
　　And it appears with a picture on the Related Pages section below.
　　A list page that is just a list of lists is a [tasteless page].
