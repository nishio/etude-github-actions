Considerations on how to expose objects
	[Implemented interactively with TypeScript#5def2f3aaff09e000025a837] is a style that puts "code to expose the subject" in one place
		Look at the target file, check "this is it", EXPORT, and then edit another file.
	Conversely, you can prepare a "function that takes an argument and exposes it" and call it near each target you want to expose.
	Which is better.
	Is it easier to manage if they are all in one place?
		And the code to expose variables is scattered after all...
			There is also a way to create a variable in the module scope first and export it, even if the code exposes a local variable.
	Is it better to have a "function that takes an argument and exposes it", so that the intent is clearer than a simple assignment?
	I made it up as I went along.
		code:ts
		 export const makeGlobal = (name: string, obj: any) => {
     // @ts-ignore
     window.debug[name] = obj;
   }
 But this may not be a good idea, because if the code is not used for anything other than exposing the target, it will be considered an unused module.
 Also errors such as `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'makeGlobal' before initialization`.
 I decided not to go deeper this time.
