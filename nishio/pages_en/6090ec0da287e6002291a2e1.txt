 *1392791072* "10x productivity" is compared to a muffler.
 They say, "Programmers have a tenfold difference in productivity depending on their abilities," but this is not limited to programming. If you were to pit Mr. X, who has no knitting experience, against Mr. Y, who has already knitted many scarves, and you were to compare the time it takes to knit the first five rows of a scarf, Mr. Y would finish knitting while Mr. X reads the knitting instructions. That's what skill is all about.
 
 Technology can indeed change productivity tenfold. However, if the goal is not to "knit a scarf" but to "attract the attention of handsome Mr. Z," then Ms. X does not need to compete in the disadvantageous scarf making. For example, if she is better at cooking, she can try her hand at cooking. In this way, the productivity gap disappears. This is the trap of specialization.
 
 It is unfortunate that Mr. Y sometimes loses his cool because he is so fixated on the "hand-knit scarf" option because of his hand-knitting ability. Furthermore, when Mr. Z starts looking down on Ms. X for not having hand-knitting ability and saying things like "hand-knitted scarves have absolute value," you don't like it. Thus, technology has both advantages and disadvantages. Technology is neutral, and both advantages and disadvantages depend on the person using it.
 
 I posted it on Twitter and only the first two parts of the trilogy were RT'd, so I reprinted them all together.
