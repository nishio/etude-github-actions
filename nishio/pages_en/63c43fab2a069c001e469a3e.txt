I don't want to live.
　I want to do something about the fact that [I don't want to live] has become a habit of mine[/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon] from [/villagepump/2023/01/14].
　Is it not "[I want to die]"? [/villagepump/inajob.icon].
　Is it [a false dichotomy]?
　I often imagine people saying things like, "I don't even feel like actively taking the action of 'death', I just want to quietly disappear."[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　So "I want to live" and "I want to die" doesn't sound right.
　I think this diagram matches.
　[false dichotomy].
　Apart from the conflict between "I want to live" and "I want to die," there is the conflict between "I want to be active" and "I don't want to be active."
