offensive
When you consider someone A to be aggressive, you often interpret this as "A's intent to attack a human being", is this interpretation correct?

In fact, A is acting without paying much attention to humans, thinking "there is a current situation that is not good, and we need to make this better," and then some people just misinterpret that behavior as an attack on humans on their own?

It has often been observed that some people perceive what is not an attack as an attack on their own.
