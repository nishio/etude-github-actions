pScaffoldNetwork
Experiments in building a [scaffolding network
　In [pLinkSuggest] we did find common substrings between a "given sentence" and a "large number of pre-parsed documents"
　　This means that in Scrapbox, given a new page, it is equivalent to finding links between that page and other pages
　　On the other hand, it could also be used as a fuzzy cross search within the collection, and I left it wondering which way to go.
　The hypothesis is that it is better to create a "scaffolding network" for "a set of pages that do not yet have links" rather than to find "links between one page and a set of other pages".

　A prototype was created.
　　Import an average of 1000 characters and 300 articles as plain text input.
　　　does not look bad
　　I tried to make something publicly available[/nishida-kitaro] as input.
　　　This is not good.
　　　Because they don't understand "links that already exist."
　　　Chapter headings, etc., added by hand for navigation, are naturally substrings of the carryout, making them links within links.
　　　Need process to combine link notation into one token

	Using MeCab's Constrained Analysis
　Created a development environment for Deno.
　I was able to parse the Scrapbox notation and output the format for MeCab's constrained analysis
	　Scrapbox notation combined into one token
　Flagged not to include in keywords.

	The original data contains nearly identical sentences in different versions, and the long matches are treated as keywords.

　Ability to show what will be updated in a dry-run instead of a sudden destructive update (in progress).
　TODO Support for block notation currently ignored
　TODO notation sway absorption is quite intense and identical, so it would be more satisfactory to loosen it a little more.
