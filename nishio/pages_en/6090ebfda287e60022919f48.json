 Uh-oh. As a result of the move, the contents of the house, including the contents of the closets, have been boxed up and placed in a smaller house, and as a matter of course, there is even less room to step on the floor. It is a hassle to clean up. But there is one thing I cannot forget. There is natto in one of these boxes! (I should have thrown them away.)

 The problem is that there's no place to hang clothes... The problem is that there's a horizontal tree (what do you call it?) attached to the inside of the closet. <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%95%B7%E6%8A%BC'>long armrest</a>?) It turned out to be OK if I could pass the buttstock there. I'll go buy a suitable length of buttstock.

 The movers put it there, and it's pretty nice. It's a place to put keys and stuff when you come back. Hired.
