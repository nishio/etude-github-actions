progressivism
From the point of view that sees value in the progress of [civilization], there is no value in an entity that is an obstacle to the progress of civilization.

When [aliens] come to Earth and try to intervene so that Earth's civilization can progress, such beings will be exterminated.

Human rights are not relevant at this time. Aliens do not necessarily identify whether the target of their extermination is human or not.

Human rights are rights that Homo sapiens grant to other Homo sapiens in the present civilization, and there is no guarantee that other species will grant human rights to Homo sapiens.

Human rights are just local rules among homo sapiens.

Thinking neutrally, when humans remove rotten oranges from a box of oranges and throw them away, they might ask, "Don't oranges have human rights?" Just as humans don't think that Homo sapiens have human rights when they take a box of oranges and throw them away, aliens don't think that Homo sapiens have human rights either.

I'm not really interested in the prosperity of homo sapiens."
Well, maybe."
You'd think that half of all Homo sapiens would be terminated for the sake of advancing Homo sapiens civilization."
'No, it doesn't even have to be a Homo sapiens civilization. Like, if an alien civilization advances by absorbing Homo sapiens, then it is preferable to be absorbed."

Most homo sapiens are not aiming for the prosperity of homo sapiens in the first place, but for their own happiness, so why not if it is absorbed by happiness?"
