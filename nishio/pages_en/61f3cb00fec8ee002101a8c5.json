Anticipating cynicism can be helpful in defense.
Sarcasm is beneficial when used well, but when it fails, it destroys relationships. Anticipating sarcasm can be helpful in defense.

Store your cynicism and know how to use it.

This is the most tactful point in human relations. Such sarcasm is often thrown in to test one's mood, and by that means one often obtains the touchstone of the most sensitive and perceptive mind. Other sarcasms are malicious, insolent, poisoned by jealousy, poisoned by passion, and destroy all goodwill and respect at once with one unexpected blow. Struck by the slightest word of this kind, many are turned away from intimate associations with superiors and inferiors who would not be the least bit shaken by public intrigue or private malice. On the other hand, other cynicism works favorably, confirming and helping one's reputation. But the more subtle the irony, the more cautiously it must be received, and the more foresightedly the irony must be foreseen. For here the knowledge of evil is itself a defensive measure, and the foreseen shot will always miss its mark.
