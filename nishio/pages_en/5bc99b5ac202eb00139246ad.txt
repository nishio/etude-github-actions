This is the [Hindu] theory that In other words, the three pillars [Brahma], [Vishnu], and [Shiva] are the three functions of [creation], [maintenance], and [destruction] of the universe deified in the form of a trio. Generally speaking, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are responsible for creation, maintenance, and destruction/[rebirth], respectively, but variations exist among different sects.
