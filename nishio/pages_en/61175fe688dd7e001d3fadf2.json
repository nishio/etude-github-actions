I came across it while researching the concept of "invincibles," and it's surprisingly science fiction.
　A world where VR goggles are all over the place.
　AI uses big data analysis to find "invincibles" who are likely to cause mass murders and uses another "invincible" to prevent them from happening.
　AI wants the human to make the final decision, and the protagonist is forced into that role (in exchange for his/her life).
