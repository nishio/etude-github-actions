Active and Passive
When I delved into the disagreement, I found that there are two interpretations of the terms [active] and [passive].
In the context of whether [information gathering] is [active] or [passive]:.

	Interpretation 1:.
		Passive: information gathering with extrinsic motivation
		Active: information gathering done with [intrinsic motivation
	Interpretation 2: The
		Passive: information gathering done through [one-way communication
		Active: information gathering done through [two-way communication

For example, in the situation "I attended a study group and listened to a lecture and left because of my own interest rather than an order from my boss," Interpretation 1 is judged as "active" because it is based on intrinsic motivation, while Interpretation 2 is judged as "passive" because it is only received in one direction.
