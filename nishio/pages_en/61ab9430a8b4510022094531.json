Philosophy books and code reading
Reading and comprehending difficult [philosophy books] and reading and understanding complex software source code ([code reading]) have quite a bit in common

The understanding of software can be verified by tinkering with it and seeing if it produces the expected results. Since verification of understanding of philosophy is not easy, the percentage of people who think they understand but actually do not understand is probably higher among philosophers than among software engineers.
