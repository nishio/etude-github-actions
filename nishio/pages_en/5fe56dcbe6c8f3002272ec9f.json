If you're not motivated, you're not motivated to do the things that motivate you.
When you don't feel [motivated], take a [walk].

Sometimes you can "motivate" yourself to take an escapist walk if you just don't have the motivation for a specific task.
　So sometimes "just take a walk" works.

But when I'm generally unmotivated, I don't have the "motivation" to take a walk.

　　Decide where to go
