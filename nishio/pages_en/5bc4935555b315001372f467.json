Attention mechanism is a dictionary object
Is [Attention Mechanism] a [Dictionary Object]?

Thinking about [internal product attention
[$ Attention(query, Key, Value) = Softmax(query \cdot Key) \cdot Value]

	In higher dimensional vectors, any two vectors have an inner product approximately equal to zero ([curse of dimensionality]).
	Using the [soft-argmax] approximation, it is practically argmax
	Even if a Keyâ†’Value function is difficult to acquire by learning, it can be created by memory
 The actual dictionary object determines key matches, but here the inner product proximity
 	Almost every inner product is zero, so space would be divided up fuzzy like this.
