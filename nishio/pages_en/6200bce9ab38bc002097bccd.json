(7.2.3.1) Getting knowledge from others is low cost
The acquisition cost of knowledge is cheap when there is a person who has acquired the field C nearby and learns knowledge of field C from that person. If a detailed person is on your side, you can hear what you do not understand immediately.

Some people may have a negative feeling in asking questions that you do not understand. But asking questions is the correct behavior for management. For example, Google Principal Scientist [Vincent Vanhoucke] propose [15 minutes rule]. They say to a new team member, "When you get stuck in something, first try yourself a 15 minute solution, and in fifteen minutes ask another person for help."

First trying to solve yourself for 15 minutes is to not waste others' time. And if it did not resolve in 15 minutes, it is necessary to ask others for help. Because the possibility that a person who could not solve even 15 minutes to solve it even by putting in more time is low, it is a waste of time.

Suppose a problem will be solved in five minutes by talking to someone else.
A person without the ability to solve the problem alone spent an hour alone with it.
From the perspective of an organization manager, this is a waste of labor costs.
It is better for business management to ask questions when you can not solve it alone. (*12)

*12: Whether 15 minutes is appropriate depends on the nature of the work and the situation of the organization. For example, if it is part of a training program for newcomers and we want to develop their ability to work through things alone, it is better to take a longer time for them to work alone.
