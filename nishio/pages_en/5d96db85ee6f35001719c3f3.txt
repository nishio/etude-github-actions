A uniform three-day weekend ignores diversity.
>"We will have three days off a week for a month" is an act of imposing a uniform way of working, ignoring "[the diversity that exists]" where the optimal way of working is different for each employee. For example, if you have something you want to accomplish by the end of the month, you will lose 20% of your work time, which is a nuisance. Ideally, people who want to take time off should be able to do so when they want to take time off. It is not [forcing people to take time off].
