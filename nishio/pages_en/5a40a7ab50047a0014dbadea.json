 I came up with the question, "Give me three implicit assumptions that can be read from the [Singularity] diagram.

 First, from the fact that the cleverness axis is represented by a single line, we can read the assumption that "cleverness can be expressed as a one-dimensional quantity. Next, from the fact that human cleverness is represented by a horizontal line, we can read the assumption that "human cleverness does not change over time. From the fact that human intelligence is expressed as a line without thickness, we can read that "the intelligence of all humans is the same.
	Other possible explanations include "machines are currently inferior to humans" and "improvements in machine performance will accelerate over time.
