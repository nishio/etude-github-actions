coarse-grained objectivity
Subjectively, I feel like I slept well, but objectively, when I sleep less than usual, I end up feeling that the objective is more correct than the subjective. However, I thought that the "objective" may only be able to pick up one aspect of the facts, and the resolution may be too coarse.
