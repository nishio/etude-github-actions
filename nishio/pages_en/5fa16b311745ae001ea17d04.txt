　Thoughts.
　　[consider in order from the smallest to the largest].
　　When N=2
　　　1,2 would be OK with 1,3 2,1
　　　If 2,1, then 1,2 3,1 is OK.
　　Is it tricky to have the middle come to the edge with N=3?
　　　1,3,2 would be 1,4,6 5,4,1
　　First, 1,2,3 3,2,1 as a baseline, all to be N+1
　　Multiply all of this by X. It's easier to move numbers up and down, just think about moving them up.
　　Increase ap2 by 1, ap3 by 2...
　　This is the maximum +19999, so if you keep X at 20,000, it won't be reversed.
　　20000 x 20000 fits the problem conditions.
　　Side note: if it didn't fit in the problem conditions, I would have had to move b and cram it in, but it doesn't seem to be required to go that far.
　Official Explanation OK
