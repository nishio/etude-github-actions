There is an [assumption] that [Zen] or [meditation] is "something you do while sitting" ([zazen]), but it is also possible to walk[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　Rather, I personally envision it as a "[walk]" that will become a part of my life and easier to do.

>When you are conscious of your delicate senses, you cannot think this or that in your head first.
> You will feel that only the senses are being manifested.
> Ego-consciousness fades.
> It is a state in which only the sensation of the feet appears, rather than the fact that you are walking.
> You can be in a state where there is no self, no person, just the sensation of walking.
　cf. [no self], [forgetful], [immersed].
> It takes a long time to get into this state of mind with zazen alone, but with walking zazen, it is easier to concentrate on the faintest movement.
> It is possible to achieve deep mental concentration in a very short period of time.
	A kind of [keep your head busy][/villagepump/nishio.icon].

Doing it in between zazen is a kind of [walking and then sitting].
	The concept of exercising and then calming down is common with [kundalini meditation].
