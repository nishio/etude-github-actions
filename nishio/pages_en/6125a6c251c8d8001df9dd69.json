Note to re-launch the development environment since the OS was rebooted.
　Changed the local directory name from movidea to kozaneba since it was a good opportunity.
　$ code kozaneba
　devserver
	　$ npm start
	[Cyperss]
	　$ npx cypress open
	[Firebase Local Emulator]
		$ firebase emulators:start
			PS
			$ firebase emulators:start --import firebase_emulator_data
　Rename each terminal.

　I'll run the test for now.
　　I forgot to export the user data I had in the Firebase auth emulator, so the name I gave to the test account disappeared.

　　　Oh, I shouldn't have used Ctrl+C to exit? I can't start it.

     Kill the process kill -9 <process id>
　　　Only the Firestore emulator was alive.
　　　 No -9 on kill.

The problem is that the coordinates are out of order when the context menu is displayed,
	I've noticed that it happens with selections and fixed it, but I'm not sure if it also happens with groups in some cases...
	Caused by code that resets top/left values tweaked while dragging, which also occurs on click
	You've got clicks and drags that are now caused by a form of mouseup/down combination that does its own thing.
	The internal state has not changed, so ignoring it and doing something else will fix it... but normal users will try to fix it if the display is broken...

When I try to title a group of groups, I don't get the text of grandchildren kozane in the default value.
	The default value is "the title of the item in the group is connected to the default value", so a group without a title is just a blank line.

I'll write later in the release notes.
	Include the contents of untitled groups in the default value when editing group titles.
	Fixed a bug where creating a group and deleting a selection was not considered an update and was not saved to the cloud.
	Fixed a bug that caused the display to temporarily shift when clicking to bring up the context menu.
 Improved loading display

Wanted features
　Place list in order of update
　Save Place As
　　Would you like to be able to lead-only at this time?

We'll have to write the Firestore rules properly to make lead-only a reality.

next [Kozaneba Development Diary 2021-08-26].
