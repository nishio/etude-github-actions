star-crossed communication
	One central person X is [communicating] with others A, B, C and there is no communication between A, B, C
	X can figure out who knows what and what they don't know
	So, with malicious intent, you can mislead one of A, B, or C, get them on the wrong side of each other, or put the blame for their failures on them.

	is often the case
		'Talking about them individually is confusing, so let's centralize the information!' etc.

	If it's done by a well-intentioned and competent person, well, it's beneficial.
	If someone is incompetent with good intentions, there will be a communication omission with no ill intent on his/her part, which will cause trouble.
		Well, in that case, A~C know that X is bad, so they naturally switch hubs.
		If roles are fixed by external factors, such as "X is an employee and A~C are part-timers," this is a problem.

	In case of malicious intent
		Don't communicate with each other" and "don't talk to others" are dangerous signs
		When people say these things to me, I immediately create a non-star type communication channel.
		Gather evidence such as different people saying different things.
