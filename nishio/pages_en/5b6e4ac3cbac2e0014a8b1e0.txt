bracketing
In Scrapbox, keywords in a sentence can be enclosed in brackets ` [ ] ` to make it a link in the project. This is the most important notation.
Both external links and text decoration are done by enclosing them in brackets: `[* bold]`, etc. So, this kind of "markup" thing on Scrapbox is called "bracketing".

When we use the word "markup," we tend to be conscious of text decoration within a single page, but what is important when considering the organization of knowledge is page-to-page linking, and a notation that allows this to be done without stress was essential. Bracketing fulfills this feature and is very good.
