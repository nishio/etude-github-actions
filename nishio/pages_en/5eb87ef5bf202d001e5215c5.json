vindelbund
>Wilhelm Windelband (May 11, 1848 - October 22, 1915) was a German philosopher. He was a professor at the University of Heidelberg and a representative of the neo-Kantian school.

>He also devoted his efforts to the problem of drawing a line between [the natural sciences] and [the cultural sciences] (also called [the spiritual sciences]). Natural science uses a [law-establishing] ([nomothetisch]) method. That is, natural science describes its subject through [universally valid] [laws]. Cultural science, on the other hand, works with the [one-time], the [individual], and the [idiosyncratic], and uses [idiographisch] methods.
