 *1330170820* Played with visia
 
 I played against my wife. The game consists of six colored triangular tiles on a hue ring, arranged so that adjacent colors are adjacent to each other on the hue ring. 3 points are awarded for making a circle of six colors, 2 points for making a circle of two colors, and 1 point for making any other circle; you always have two tiles in your hand and four open tiles to share.

 I thought I was better at this game, and I did indeed lead at first, but I lost by 4 points. I had 12 tokens to keep track of the rings I had made, and the game ended when someone ran out of tokens. I made a low-scoring circle and chased after him, but he was ahead of me with 4 tokens left. 4 points difference and 4 tokens difference means that if I had made a 1-point circle and chased after him, we would have tied the game.
 
 My wife and I were talking about how it's not refreshing enough, but I wonder if it's wrong that the cost of the tiles is just cardboard or something. I can't place them exactly right. It would have been better if they were made of grooved boards like Blox and transparent plastic tiles... but I guess they can't be transparent because they have to be turned inside out to hide the color.
