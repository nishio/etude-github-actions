Participate in projects you don't share
　Should I not participate in projects that I don't [sympathize] with?
　If you participate in a project that you don't share, and then communicate your opinion, it's possible that some people will share that opinion.
　　[first follower makes leader].
　　[Engulfing force]
　In that case, it creates [diversity of opinion] in the project.
　This is preferable.
　If it doesn't generate followers, [it can] just disappear [naturally].
