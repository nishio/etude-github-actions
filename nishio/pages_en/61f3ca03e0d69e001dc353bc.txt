Use cunning, but do not abuse it.

Use [cunning], but do not abuse it.

People should not appreciate it, much less boast about it. Anything artificial should be concealed, and cunning in particular is frowned upon. Deception is of great use. Therefore, our vigilance must be doubled. But it must not be out in the open. For it arouses distrust, causes much annoyance, evokes vengeance, and gives rise to more evil than we can imagine. To go about one's work with care is a great advantage in action, and there is no greater proof of wisdom. The greatest skill in any action lies in the proficiency with which it is performed with certainty.
