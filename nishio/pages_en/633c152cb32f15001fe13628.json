human word salad
When we see a meaningful sentence with a mixture of known and unknown keywords, we try to read the meaning, but it may actually be [word salad], or a human being may be creating a word salad.

How can we avoid wasting time by getting caught up in those things?

How can I identify if a sentence that doesn't make sense is a meaningless word salad or if it is just beyond my [understanding]?
