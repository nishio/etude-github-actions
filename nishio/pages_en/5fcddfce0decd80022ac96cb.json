Collapsing Duplicate Combinations
[$ \sum_i \binom{A + i}{i}\binom{B + K - i}{K - i} = \binom{A + B + K + 1}{K}]
This expression variant can be interpreted as a convolution of [duplicate combination] with another duplicate combination

[duplicate combinations]: Number of ways to select k out of n, allowing for duplicates
	[$ H^n_k = \binom{n + k - 1}{k}]

The left side is a duplicate combination that selects i from A+1 and K-i from B+1, and the convolution of this is a duplicate combination that selects K from A+B+2.
	[$ \sum_i \binom{A + i}{i}\binom{B + K - i}{K - i} = \sum_i H^{A+1}_i H^{B+1}_{K-i} = H^{A+B+2}_K = \binom{A + B + K + 1}{K}]

　The problem of adding all patterns under the condition that the lower part of the binomial coefficient is fixed and the upper number has a constant sum.
	[$ \sum_i \binom{A + i}{i}\binom{B + K - i}{K - i} = \sum_i \binom{A + i}{A}\binom{B + K - i}{B}]
		[lower fixed binomial coefficient → overlapping combination].
	　Can you make a direct duplicate combination with the lower fixed?
		[$ \sum_i \binom{A + i}{A}\binom{B + K - i}{B} = \sum_i H_A^{i+1} H_B^{K-i+1} = H_{A+B}^{K+2} = \binom{A + B + K + 1}{A+B}]
		　The math doesn't add up.
		　[$ \binom{A + B + K + 1}{A+B+1}] should be
			This is because the number of frames itself is changing, which is causing double counting.
			If we think of adding a bounding ball, the bottom would likely be A+B+1, but then wouldn't we need to increase the top as well? I'm inclined to think that
			In fact, this is fine because the boundary does not play the role of only a boundary (the ball can be placed in the same position as the boundary) by being a duplicate combination, but this may be confusing.
