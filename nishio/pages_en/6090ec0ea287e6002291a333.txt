 *1439303599* All conversations in a specific group on Facebook backed up.
 Facebook is not searchable, so I decided to switch to kintone, but then I find myself thinking, "Where did I put that information I wrote on Facebook before?
 
 It's a rough solution, but here's what it looks like anyway:
 
 - Remove the extra notification div that appears on the right.
 - Repeat scroll to view all threads
 - To expand the folded thread, the following code is executed until the output is zero (asynchronous, so it is not possible to run while, and in fact, I think it would not be good to run forEach as well, since dozens of requests are suddenly run in para).
 - Print to PDF
 
 >||
 var xs = document.getElementsByClassName('UFIPagerLink'); [].forEach.call(xs, function(x){x.click()}); console.log(xs.length)
 ||<
 
 It's a lot of work, with 100 page PDFs being output, but it should be searchable at least.
 
 PS: I also need to revert to being digested when the body of the post is long. a.see_more_link.
