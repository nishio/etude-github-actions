Action and object and subject and object
[https://gyazo.com/0e5e8e6a5ed725e505eb539885c0ab9d]
I kind of drew it, but if I don't verbalize it in the form of [legend], I might lose the meaning, so I made a note of it.
	Arrows represent [action
 Representation of [object] in a box
 	The subject may be [subject] or [object].
  Tend to think of "things" as objects from a non-programming tradition.
		But a program is a thing, but it can be a subject of action.
 The arrow was attached to the box to express that "the action is attributed to the object".
 But it's not good to describe things in terms of "skimmers" because they are often overlooked
 A bridge until I can come up with a better expression.
