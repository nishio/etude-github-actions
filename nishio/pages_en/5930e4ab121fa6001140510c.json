Difference between an expert and a leader
	A leader does not deserve the name unless he is willing occasionally to stand alone.
		If one is not prepared to make a solitary decision at a "critical moment," he or she is not a leader.
	The task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been.
		The leader's job is to lead the group from where they are now to where they have never been.
	It is, after all, the responsibility of the expert to operate the familiar and that of the leader to transcend it.
		The responsibility of an expert is to demonstrate his or her capabilities in a field with which he or she is familiar, and the role of a leader is to push the boundaries of his or her experience.
