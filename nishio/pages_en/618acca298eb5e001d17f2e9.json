Live warped and happy.
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1458124300322435077]: went to bed at a weird time and woke up at a weird time again...

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1458129055690072066]: I missed out on the daily Pikmin, but this is the same as the other day's "whether or not I think I missed out on gains in the stock market," and I guess the ability to be blunt [and not think of what I missed out on as a loss] is necessary to increase the [happiness] level of life. I guess the power is necessary to increase the [happiness] level of life.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1458130204774125569]: "[insensitivity]" is described positively, but this is clearly a cognitive distortion of "overestimating certain losses". Well, it's also a cognitive distortion to think that if one person out of billions of humans disappears, it doesn't affect the many, so it makes sense for me to live my life, so I'd rather live happily with the distortion.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1458134553755721734]: "I underestimate certain losses." But thinking about it, I don't think I always underestimate losses, and maybe I "underestimate both losses and gains, both belonging to the past".
