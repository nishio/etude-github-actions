　Thoughts.
　　What does the information given in the question mean?
　　So the LCA of i and ai is lower than the LCA of 1 and i.
　　The height must be as high as the number of people x who fought against 1 and lost, the same with respect to those who fought against x and lost, and so on down recurrently.
　　The length of the game is fixed when it comes to those who have not lost to anyone else.
　　Long rows should be branched as close to the root as possible, and finalized in order on the way back.
　Official Explanation OK
　 In the words of the official explanation, when the child is determined, the parent is determined DP, and how to arrange the child when it is determined is the greedy method.
