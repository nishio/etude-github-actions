The cat says meow.
	Statements that say, "I have a [request]."
 I don't know what they are asking for.
 It seems that they learn that "just say meow and the humans will take care of it" by humans taking care of them and dealing with them.
	 Meow when humans are near the cat toilet -> clean up the toilet.
	 Meow when humans are in the kitchen â†’ serve food.
 There are no clear rules, but rather a fuzzy correspondence.
 I guess [language] will be created by making this correspondence more explicit.
