Individual cases
2018-03-23
 Regarding the thought pattern of "don't get too deep into [individual] cases."
 While "[n=1] doesn't make a decision" is the right attitude from a [scientific] point of view, that [way of thinking] implicitly assumes a subject that can be [repeatedly experimented upon].
 Using that way of thinking on a subject that cannot be repeatedly experimented with will only produce the sterile output of "[there are too few examples to say anything]".
 [When you are trying to make something new, it is rarer to have sufficient data on the subject on which you have to make a decision.
 If there is a bias to avoid [digging into] n=1 cases, then when exposed to that type of problem, "try to [abstract]"
 We consider it a positive act implicit in such phrases as "[tedious] discarding [branches and leaves]," and "[essence]."
 On the other hand, this abstraction is an individual's [interpretation], not a fact #Fact and Interpretation ref. [Einstein's empirical axiom verification model].
 It can be described as a negative act of "arguing based on interpretation without properly delving into [the facts] at hand.
 Even when confronted with the same fact, each person has a different interpretation of it.
 Discussions based on interpretation are prone to discrepancies.
 The ethnographic approach to this type of issue is to try to gather as much [relevant information] as possible for the case.
 Even though there is only one case and we cannot infer the distribution of the event itself from it, if we know the [surrounding information], we can describe the [generating system] itself that produces the event.
