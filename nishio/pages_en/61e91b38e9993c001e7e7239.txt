(3.5) Spaced repetition method that lasts knowledge
We learned about the experiments of Karpicke and Blunt in [(3.4.2) Learn more after testing]. In the experiments, subjects learned during the day and tested in a week. The memory is judged by whether or not they can recall after a week. If you are studying for the exam after one week, it is beneficial to raise the score in a week.
