	Define the distance between two points a and b on the disk D as [$ d(a, b) = \log \frac{ 1 + |c| }{1 - |c|}
		where [$ c(a, b) = \frac{b - a}{1 - \bar{a}b}]
			[First Order Fractional Conversion]
		Especially when a=0 [$ d(0, b) = \log \frac{ 1 + |b| }{1 - |b|}]
	I want to find the distance between a=<r, -t> and b=<r, +t> for small t
		b - a is [$ 2ir\sin t].
		|b - a| is [$ 2r\sin t].
		Since [$ |\bar{a}b|] is the product of complex numbers of length r, r^2
		(wrong) |c| = [$ 2r\sin t / (1 - r^2)]
			r is 0 to 1
			Huh? If|c| exceeds 1, the denominator of d(a, b) will be negative, right? What did I do wrong?
			Ah, not [$ 1-|\bar{a}b|], but [$ |1-\bar{a}b|].
		[$ |1-\bar{a}b|] is the distance between <r^2, 2t> and 1, so [$ \sqrt{1 + r^4 -2 r^2 \cos t}]
		Assuming cos t = 0.999, it looks like this
			[https://gyazo.com/221ad686b9a81ba6816aeb546771dbe2]
			Then sin t is about 0.045
		[https://gyazo.com/bdec1c35b17188af5e50cee13f72ac2a]
			It's still over 1. What's wrong yet?
