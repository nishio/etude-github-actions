 I've written about 10 play diaries for [GeoGuessr], but they don't seem to be conversation starters unless we're playing in the same place, so there's no advantage to keeping them at the well.
 And now I'm thinking, "Five rounds of one play, I should probably chop it up, especially since it doesn't matter," so that would be 50 pages.
 I think I'll do this on my own project...
 Once I put it here [/geoguessr-nishio].
 	It is interesting to see the differences between countries that I had not been aware of before[/villagepump/kidooom.icon][/villagepump/inajob.icon].

 		I'm a little curious, but I feel like [I'm reading a strategy book][/villagepump/inajob.icon].
 			Do you feel like your enjoyment is spoiled?
 			I'd like to see it answered.

　I thought I would operate the GeoGuessr project as just GeoGuessr for a while.
　　That would be more interesting than merging them into a private project at this point.
　Interesting why you think so.
　　Maybe you've never written much about geography in your own personal projects, so you don't think you'll connect with it if you put it there.
　　It would be more interesting if the list pages were lined up with information related to the theme.
　　It's the same phenomenon as [/sta/clioa-san-paradise].

 If you cut out the GeoGuessr playlog by country and then cut out the clues, it's just like "from Norway".
 GeoGuessr also has a sense of "becoming visible" as you do it, but it's not fundamentally manufacturing, so it doesn't feel like [a new door has opened].
 GeoGuessr has become more of a challenge: "How can we network knowledge in Scrapbox for speedy retrieval?
 　Name the concept
  　Characters with dots and such" --> "Characters with [diacritical marks]."
  　　I knew [Sedille] and [Umraut] from the beginning.
  　　[Ring], [Macron].
  　　Giving yourself a name that you are comfortable calling yourself will help you recognize the concept.
  　　　It's oslash! Denmark or Norway!"
  How to engrave a page
  　At first I wrote the plays in chronological order.
  　'Since each round is a random country, why not just put them all on one page?'
  　　It is readable to summarize in chronological order
  　　Pointless when considering reuse.
  　　Cut out the country as the title.
  　　　Cut more clues out of it (with photocopies)
  　   I'm having trouble deciding if it's a good idea to cut out the move, so I made a copy of it.
  　   No duplicates" has little to do with usefulness, duplicates are better (or worse?)
  　   Is it beneficial to consolidate those that will need to be updated so that I don't forget to update them? Is it beneficial to make as many copies of things that will not be updated as possible?
 　Do not intentionally add links
 　　Where he says "I wonder if it's Rao language" in a case where we finally know it's Cambodian.
 　　[/geoguessr-nishio/cambodia#63d42b72aff09e000060ad57]
 　　　Putting the link here has the advantage for those who don't know "rao language" that they can go to the explanation page without having to search for it.
  　　On the other hand, for those who already know?
  　　　Are there any disadvantages? Yes?
  　The stop sign listing page has an example for Ukraine, but no link.
  　	[/geoguessr-nishio/STOP sign]
  　　Not good enough to get a list of stop signs with backlinks from the Ukraine page.
  　　　Are you sure about that?
  　　If you look at the stop sign page and say "I see, Ukraine?", I don't need the link because I'm already going on to answer the question.
  　　　Are you sure about that?
 　The topic of identification of Cambodia and Laos on the Cambodia page.
 　　Copied and cut out, also linked to Laos
 　　[/geoguessr-nishio/cambodia-and-laos-identification].
 People tend to place excessive value on "[having] seen it all.
 　Misrepresenting as if you've accomplished something by expressing that you've "read" the translation after just one look at it.
 　Knowledge is not input just by looking at it one way.
 　Scrapbox seems difficult to "see all the way through".
 　　So they say, "I don't know where to start reading."
 　　　Why don't you just read it from the top pinned? Or so it would seem.
 　　The essential problem is not "[not knowing] where to start reading" but rather "not knowing where to start reading and where to get to to be able to say I've read it all."
 　I'm compiling the GeoGuessr strategy in Scrapbox the way it is now, I guess they don't like it because they can't read it all in one place.
 　　I don't want to create a preferred strategy site, so I don't mind.

　Observation of what is happening
　Level 1
　 Note-taking for strategy videos
　 I'm watching a video explaining the strategy and taking notes.
　Level 2
　 Observation of play video
　 The difference from Level 1 is that the performer in the video is not 100% focused on commentary, but rather on playing the game
　 There are cases where decisions are difficult and distressing, such as
　 I'm taking notes on what to look for and how to think about it.
　Level 3
　 Observation logs compiled in chronological order are engraved and recompiled by the State.
　　This is equivalent to classifying a miscellany of time series according to pre-defined classification criteria.
　Level 4
　 Closely Coupled Tips to the State are Dangled
　 　The license plate with red letters is Belgium.
　 　R$ is Brazilian Real
　 　.at is Austria
　Level 5
　　Cross-country concepts are lumped together.
　　Actually, some were given at level 1.
　　　[/geoguessr-nishio/holey pole]
　　　　Hungary, Romania, Poland
　　I started to pull this out of my level 2 observations.
　　A page titled "Identification of Country A and Country B" has begun to be created.
　　　Example: [/geoguessr-nishio/Malaysia and Indonesia identification].
　　　Until then, the title of the concept or term, like "Holy Pole" or "S Hacek", would indicate which country it was used in on that page.
　　　Was it done first to give names to concepts to make them easier to recognize?
　Level 6
　 Refactoring of concepts began to occur.
　 　The "S Hacek" page has disappeared.
 　 　This doesn't narrow it down much as a hint.
 　 　Also similar refinement to Z Herchek
 　 　　Even with both, the aperture doesn't increase.
　 　The key is E Hacek.
　 　　Fixed to Czech
　 　[/geoguessr-nishio/Hacek].
	　 　[https://gyazo.com/8a53a6b5328279e8ca89ad2be59023a7]
				The order in which they could be narrowed down.
　 A page with descriptions of the letters has been created.
　 　I remembered that I had created the page [/geoguessr-nishio/ð/ð], but I could not speedily retrieve it from the list
　 　Make pages about text easy to find with related links on the pinned text page.
　 　Easy to open with an easy-to-type name: "D stroke."

　It's interesting to see [geoguessr-nishio] and get a glimpse of [the process of what kind of path to follow for better understanding][/villagepump/issac.icon].
 　[geoguessr-nishio#63d7c203aff09e0000acaab8]
　　I wonder if I can do something too.
　　It's going to be about whether it's a kuzushiji character or a waka poem.
　　　On my scale, I don't know what other people want. I want to hear
　　　　Do you want to invite others to your project like [/villagepump/blu3mo.icon] did?
　　　　　No, I mean, you don't talk about waka poetry in your own projects that much...
 　　　　Could this get some good feedback? They're thinking about it.

　Correct structure is not the same as useful structure.
　　And I was organizing [/geoguessr-nishio/Currency] and thought
　　If you try to classify it in the normal sense, ₦ is a $€ companion.
　　But when you consider its use in GeoGuessr, $€ disappears because it's "used in a wide range of areas and not useful for specific purposes".
　　₦ is a ₪₹ companion in that it is definite to one country when you see it.
