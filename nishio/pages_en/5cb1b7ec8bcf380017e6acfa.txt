The Sharpie Pencil Parable
A story about how waste is not eliminated by wasteful behavior.
	The last few millimeters of mechanical pencil lead are wasted.
	To reduce waste, let's shorten the length of the core by the amount of waste.
	Shortening it doesn't change the fact that "the last few millimeters are wasted."
	Rather, on the contrary, the longer the core, the lower the percentage of waste.

A story about how the act of eliminating waste eliminates the waste we are focusing on, but creates greater waste in other areas.
	Trying to make another material out of the wasted parts.
		Surely the "core" will not be wasted.
		But "different material" goes to waste.
		Composite material cores are more expensive to make.
