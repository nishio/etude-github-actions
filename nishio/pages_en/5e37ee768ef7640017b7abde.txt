Geniuses are no match for hardworking people, and hardworking people are no match for those who enjoy it.
I saw a Japanese translation to the effect that "a genius cannot defeat a hard worker, and a hard worker cannot defeat one who enjoys it," but the original text is
>He who does not know does not like, and he who does not like does not enjoy
[Confucius] [Analects] [Yongya] No.6 20

It is fine to translate 樂之者 as someone who enjoys music, but isn't it nuanced to translate 好之者 as a hard worker and 知之者 as a genius? I thought.
I checked the context before and after and it looked like a collection of fragmented statements.
