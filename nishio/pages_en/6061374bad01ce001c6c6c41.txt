　　It was a little hard to find in a search because of the interesting title and story spinning.
　In March 2021, social networking sites were abuzz with news of Cybozu's [internal recruitment of directors].
　But I thought that in many cases, the commenters didn't grasp what happened as a preliminary step.
　　The basic premise is that the management meetings (general managers' meetings) have been operating in the open for years.
　　The article is a direct statement of that

About [General Managers' Meeting
	>Even with some discussion with the general managers in attendance, decisions are made one after another in an average of about 10 minutes.
	>Qing: "Cybozu's general managers' meetings are open to anyone who is interested."
	>Ao: "I'll create the minutes of the general manager's meeting just now and publish them on kintone as soon as possible, you see, employees have already commented on them."
	>Qing: "If you keep it open to the public, interested people will see it... The key is not to create a closed room... Keep it open, and people who think it's not right can comment. This is our way of governance.
	>Blue: "Discussions should be in public chat. If the process is shared, I don't have to explain it from scratch when I ask you to do a job, and it's important to keep the conversation as closed as possible."
　In other words, the following were already in place at this point
　　Anyone can physically participate.
　　The minutes are placed on kintone with a comment box, making it easy for employees who read them to comment (supported by the tool).
　　Positive feedback (culture aspect) from an environment where the message from the top is "open discussion is good" and where one can observe that the policy is actually being used.

About [Hierarchy Dismantling
　>Yama: "At Cybozu, do we need the word manager?　So, the Development Division eliminated the position of general manager. We distributed the authority that managers have in the information hierarchy and made it flat. If everyone has access to the same information, interested people will gather. We imagined passing authority to those people."
　When software support facilitates employee access to information, the information distribution portion of the manager's role in a traditional organization becomes unnecessary.
　The system was confirmed to cause no problems (Note: This may be because it is normal times, see below).

　　[Let's do it because we can, and if there are problems, we can stop].

[Contingency Management
　>Blue: "I think the true [teal] is the one that can be used differently. Like, for example, if there's a big problem, you can quickly switch to the red type."
 In short, we are shifting to teal because we are in [peacetime management] now, and we will temporarily shift to red in an emergency.

[Incentives other than salary
　>Yama: "In evaluation, it becomes difficult because we think of 'feedback on work' and 'distribution of salary' in combination. You can declare and decide that salary will be determined appropriately. In fact, what each person wants is different.
　>Ao: "As a manager, how many incentives other than salary can you offer? I guess the idea is that money is only part of the reward."
　The 2021 social networking response to the lack of high director compensation also shows that at this point, the idea was not that "compensation is something you give in cash."
