Mouse down on a sticky in lasso mode should not be a move of the sticky
	Maybe it's because I'm on a PC,
	Wouldn't it be more natural if stickies were moved when the mouse is down on a sticky in lasso selection mode?
 It's unnatural to switch tools only when you try to move one piece in a phase where you're moving and organizing multiple pieces around.
	If I'm doing it on an iPad, I can distinguish between the stylus and my finger.
