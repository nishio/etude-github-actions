Don't be a boring person.

People in one industry and on one topic tend to be heavy-handed. One does better business by being brief, one gains by being polite, one loses by being curt. [What is good is twice as good when it is short]. The nature of the problem is more effective than the overall clutter of details. It is a well-known truth that talkative people are often not very sensible, whether dealing with the issue itself or with it formally. Some become more of a stumbling stone than a central figure, a useless piece of lumber that stands in the way of all others. The wise man avoids becoming boring, but it is worse for the great man, who is especially busy, to stand in the way of one than all the rest. Put well and you will soon find out.
