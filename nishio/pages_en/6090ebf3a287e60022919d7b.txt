 *1193877965*Fx vs JS
 GMail has only been working in text mode for a little while now, and I was wondering why, but then Lingr also gives an error when displaying permalinks in JS, LDR doesn't work at all, and finally even how to write org failed to load jQuery or gave me a "no $! I'm not sure what to think, but it's my environment. I wonder if I should reinstall Firefox.

 PS: "Detecting java... NO JAVA!" Yeah, what the heck.
 Is my browser the only one that goes back in time to some years ago?

 "I thought I had until the 31st in October, but it was a small month and I only had until the 30th, give me back one day!"
 I meant to say that, but I was mistaken.
 
 *1193906330* Life hacks for reading English papers.
 If I try to read it as a PDF, I get sleepy or forget,
 Printing is bulky, and it's a waste of time to leave it in your bag, where it gets crumpled up.
 So how about printing just the first page? Most of them have abstracts, and the information on the first page would be enough to get to the PDF.
 
 
 The problem of messing up has not been solved, is it?

 Only the first page of the printed
 
 *1193922266*Google
 I wonder what would happen if Google made an OS.
 I wonder if they make everything.
 I wonder if it will swallow everything.
