History of Promise
[https://samsaccone.com/posts/history-of-promises.html The history of Promises]
　This person wrote a more than adequate and substantial commentary. Below is my summary and additions.

The Promise idea has its origins in an older
	[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_パターン Future pattern - Wikipedia]
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises Futures and promises - Wikipedia]

The 1997 E language is almost in the same form as Promise is today.

Twisted, a network programming framework implemented in Python in 2001, was implemented with reference to the E language
　It was called Deferred.

MochiKit, a lightweight JavaScript library, was implemented in 2005 with reference to Twisted
　At that time [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest XMLHttpRequest - Web APIs | MDN] was used, which is very annoying for people who are used to fetch now[. nishio.icon]
  The intent was to make this easier.

Dojo, Q, and a number of other JavaScript libraries began to adopt similar concepts, and jQuery did so in 2010.

　jQuery was a very major JavaScript library, at least at one time[nishio.icon].
　　The air of someone who doesn't know much about it and uses it anyway.
　　jQuery has allowed "this way of doing things" to spread to a wide range of JavaScript programmers.

A unified test case [https://promisesaplus.com/ Promises/A+] was created, and the mixed implementations of "this way of doing things" became "Promise implementations that behave the same".
　This also helped standardization by objectively demonstrating that a single concept of "Promise" is used in a wide range

It was then standardized in 2015 in the form of [ES2015].

[proposed technical additions to support coding].
