Hungry people will eat even bad food.
When our hearts are starved, we try to fill them somehow, and we fill them in ways that are not good.

A middle-aged man asked a young man who was happy to have been accepted to college if it was worth the money. The young man replied that he did not choose it based on whether it would make money or not, and the middle-aged man lectured him that it was only a skill that would make money rather than knowledge.

The starving middle-aged man ate the joy of the young man. The more he eats, the more the middle-aged man suffers, but he still eats.

Drinking salt water makes you thirsty.
