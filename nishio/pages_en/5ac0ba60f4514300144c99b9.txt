	Example of 1 yen per second calculation (Rhodia)
 	Rhodia No. 11 is just the right size for a breast pocket, but expensive
  If the purpose is only to make notes, the white printed material on the back can be cut and bundled.
  Which is more reasonable?
  Rhodia is $3 per page.
  If it takes three seconds to prepare and remove a lined notepad compared to pulling a Rhodia out of a breast pocket, the cost savings with lined paper could be reasonable.
  It is not reasonable to cut the pocket to a size that will fit through the breast pocket, because it requires cutting in several places and cannot be done in three seconds.
  	Except in the case of cutting in batches with a cutting machine
   (except in cases where the work of cutting paper has other benefits, such as being a very good refresher)
  If you don't put it in your breast pocket, it takes more than 3 seconds to take it out, which is still not reasonable.
		In reality, I don't spend this much time thinking about it and decide that I should buy it based on a "skin feeling".
			I buy sets of 10 from Amazon because I can't be bothered to even go to a stationery store to buy them [Amazon https://amzn.to/2EaXyie].
