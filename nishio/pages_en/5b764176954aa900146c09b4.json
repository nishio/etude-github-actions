First, insert Karabiner-elements
 https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements

Technically, karabiner alone should be capable of simultaneous keystrokes.
 [I learned that Karabiner-Elements alone can now implement thumb shift - Monokurobokkusu https://mono96.jp/thumb-shift/35037/]
 [orz layout2 (thumb shift) right hand shift + space key as return key Kana key as space key, key emulation with Karabiner-Element only, personally comfortable - Monokurobokkusu https://mono96.jp/thumb- shift/orz-layout/35233/]
 No general array appears to be offered as of 2018-08-17.
 I drew the key layout for now [https://gyazo.com/205f1ac6a0834c4046541b9f91858399].

There are many things I would like to change, but first of all, "I changed it to "enter" because I don't use spaces" is not good. For engineers, executing commands on the command line is a frequent task, and it is too dangerous to change the space that is often used to separate commands to "enter" to execute commands. At the very least, I wish the space would have remained a space when in English mode.

Hooray!
I was able to do it, but the judgment of the simultaneous presses is subtle.
I wonder if this is not due to the settings but my lack of familiarity with simultaneous presses.

I've started setting up symbols, but editing JSON directly is not a task that should be done by humans.

	This passage means "if you press 5 while holding down left shift, it is a closing backslash".

I created a JSON for Complex Modification that enables thumb shift for the Orz array of Karabiner on Mac, but the success rate of inputting "ã‚‡" is low. I thought my input was not good enough, but with Monokuro's Orz array JSON, it succeeds 100%. What is the difference?
