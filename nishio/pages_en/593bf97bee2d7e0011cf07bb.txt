Writing is a big task
 Divide writing into three phases: [make stickies], [compose stickies], and [put composition into writing].
 Disability in this case
 	Example 1 of Disability
  	In the [writing phase], [the excitement is on] and new things are added to the writing process #written #drainage #derailment
   	Then it would not fit the configuration.
   What do we do?
  	 Method 1: Move the new things you add to a place where they do not interfere with the composition.
    	[Go to column], [Go to footnote], etc.
  	 Method 2: Go back to the sticky note structure again # Repeat KJ method
		   [KJ method] kind of like, "Of course you have to repeat it over and over again."
		   Realistically [tradeoffs] occur within [limited time] resources #Limited resources
     Ideal, but very realistic.
  	 Method 3: [give up] that the configuration is distorted.
    	Don't delay release in search of [perfection
     No matter how much time you put into it, it will never be perfect.
     Even if you think you're perfect now, you won't think so a year from now.
     Get it out and fix it #Agile

[Writing] is [a big task].
