cash-flow game
Famous for being used to solicit for pyramid schemes [management games].
I am interested in the content but have no experience. From what I've heard.
 Basically, a game of luck in which you roll dice and advance in a backgammon-like fashion.
 You start out in the poor track and can move to the rich track if you meet certain criteria.
 One way to do this is to "invest when given the opportunity, even if it means going into debt."

It models the real world to some extent, and is real to the point where investing in debt is one way to invest, but is prone to the misconception that there is "no other way" or that a given investment opportunity is always a good one (not a scam, etc.).
As a result, it seems to have become a very convenient game for recruiting people into pyramid schemes!
