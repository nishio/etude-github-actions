 *1193966950*I'm not feeling well.
 Ahhh, cold...
 
 *1193969844*Drugs
 
 I was going to buy kaconal and isodine at the pharmacy but ended up with a spray of kudzu root and isodine. Kuzu-netto is cheaper per unit, and the direct spray seems to be more effective.
 
 *1193975845* How to write org.
 If we call the time it takes for the sun to circle the galaxy one ginga, I have only a few milligingas left in which to be active. Therefore, the system should not be a system that cannot rotate without my movement. It must be a system that continues to work even when I am gone.
 
 *1193990663*Removed dental filling.
 Mm-hmm.
 Let's go to another dentist...
