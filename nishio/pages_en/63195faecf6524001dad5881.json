As mechanization progresses and the difference in productivity between flesh and blood humans decreases, the production efficiency of instructions to machines is important.
[In a world where increasing mechanization will eliminate differences in physical productivity by flesh-and-blood humans, the efficiency of the process of producing instructions to machines, such as programming, will become an important factor in measuring human productivity].

In a world where the difference in physical productivity by [flesh and blood humans] disappears as [mechanization advances], the efficiency of [the process of producing instructions to machines], as typified by [programming], will become an important factor in measuring human productivity.

As [mechanization] progresses and the productivity gap between flesh and blood decreases, [production efficiency of instructions to machines] will become more important.
