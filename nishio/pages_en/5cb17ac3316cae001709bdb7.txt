Diagram of the updated model of how engineers learn
In [How Engineers Learn], there is a diagram that shows "the cycle of executing, verifying the results, and [the model being modified].
I drew it because I might be able to draw it better now that I have an iPad.

	First, I think, "I'd like an A."
		For example, "I want to create software with a certain function X" or "I want to eat fried eggs.
	Think "How can I get A?"(HOW)
	Think, "If I combine B and C, I might get A."

		Like, "If you put a frying pan on the stove top and put an egg in it, it's going to be a fried egg."
		Model M produces this
	I'll actually try it.
	I expected to get an A and I got a D.
		be surprised

		We now have the observed fact that "combining B and C gives us D, not A."
	Consider why D instead of A (why)
		Model M, which generated the hypothesis that "if you combine B and C, you get A," is wrong.
		Modify model M (M')

	Using the new model M', we again ask, "How can we get A?" (how).
		'Wouldn't it be nice to combine the B's and G's?' and so on.
		I'll actually try it.

Q: What is [model]?
	Models are [emulators].
	[Model is a reality emulator].
