There is not always one solution.
[https://gyazo.com/de488e0362aadcee07b450d1eb0ad8f0]

　There is almost always only one solution when you're thinking in terms of [linear functions].
　Most of the time when I think of [quadratic functions], it's either "no solution" or "two solutions."
　　Quadratic functions "have only one solution" is as rare as linear functions "have no solution"
　　Similarly for general functions, "there is only one solution" is a rare case
　In other words, linear function behavior is rarer in the whole function, but humans tend to misinterpret things as if they were linear functions

[No solution is correct.]
[Not necessarily one.]
[Non-linear]
