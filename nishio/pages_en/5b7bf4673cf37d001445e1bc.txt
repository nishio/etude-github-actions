Collaboration between projects in Scrapbox
	How can collaboration between Scrapbox projects that are edited by a single individual be a better intellectual production tool?
	Discussion about the ability to make comments and send feedback
 	[Proposal to add comment function to Scrapbox].

  [/shokai/ SNS optimization for each article attracts emptiness].
 I tried merging multiple projects as an experiment, but it wasn't great.

  Not much connection through tags as people use tags in surprisingly different ways.
  Considering Scrapbox's philosophy of "not letting people post mechanically" and "humans should use their brains to add one page at a time" in the first place, the "mechanically merge" approach makes no sense!
  Inter-project links should also be created one by one using human minds.
 As for the links between projects that exist at this time, they can be found in a search.

 	If I want to find references to my project from N projects in this way, I have to search N times.
  It is possible to create a system that automatically searches and tells us about once a day.
 But this "mention" is a "read it, notice it, mention it" process
 	The system of suggestions of your other pages when you are writing your own pages in Scrapbox helps you become aware of what you have written in the past

			It would be nice to be able to add pages from "other pre-designated projects" to this suggestion list.
   Also useful when using multiple projects by one person
