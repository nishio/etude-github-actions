People who only RT.
>[inuro https://twitter.com/inuro/status/1393588875344310275]: oops, that's a fucking rip, right? I think that when I go to the home page of a person who says, "Oh, shit, it's a rip-off, isn't it?
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393732826168582144]: maybe they don't have the ability to create content, so all they can do is RT what they like and rant about what they don't like
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393734022325366785]: this might have something to do with this I was sorting through yesterday [people who don't make things are defined by their likes and dislikes, and likes and dislikes make the world smaller]
	>[rashita2 https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1393750938708447234]: maybe it's the "power" to create, or the feeling that the channel (or tube) is closed. It's like cognitive resources are not flowing there.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393751957471256580]: like "I can't think of an option to make it" or "I don't think I can make it"?
	>[rashita2 https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1393753265091670020]: something like that, like in RPG, "not on command".
