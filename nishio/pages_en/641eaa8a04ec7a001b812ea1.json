household handicraft industry
>Household handicraft is a form of industry. The producer (and his family) directly owns the capital necessary for production. The actual work is mainly "handiwork" by craftsmen, and tools are usually necessary for production and require skill in their handling.
	>As wealth accumulation progressed and the volume of orders increased, the industry shifted to a "wholesale-based cottage industry" in which accumulated funds were used to invest in equipment, which was then rented out to others who ordered work and purchased the products. This system, however, dispersed equipment from house to house and made it difficult to manage progress, so it was replaced by the "factory-based handicraft industry" (manufaktur), in which equipment and workers are gathered in a single factory.
 > In families that do not accumulate enough wealth, they supplement their lack of work with orders from wholesalers in the wholesale handicraft industry, and eventually abandon their own equipment and become workers in the factory-based handicraft industry.
