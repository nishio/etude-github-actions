Keyword and question selection is an internal volume caution.
	On the selection of "Keyword-Question Pairs"
	The "selection of keywords and question pairs that are appropriate to the situation" is [intratumoral attention].
		The situation is an S-dimensional vector
		One S dimension key is determined for each pair of keywords and questions.
			Because that's the object of choice.
		Just multiply this inner product by Softmax and choose
			[Selection from an object of indefinite length] can be realized.
		Concerned that the number of keywords to take depends on the question.
			[keywords and question selection is a cautionary mechanism] still had trouble with it.
		One S-dimensional vector per object of choice is all that is needed.
			The function that generates the vector may be different for each question that takes 0, 1, or 2 keywords
