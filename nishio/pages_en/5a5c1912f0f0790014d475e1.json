 [I'm not sure if it should be called "management game" or not, I'm not sure about the rules.
 It would be interesting to see if it is well made, but I am a little wary because these games are often connected to bad business.
  Example: "Rich Dad" cash flow game and multi-level marketing

 >This game is officially licensed by FranklinCovey Japan K.K. and planned, produced and marketed by Nai-Nai-Nai-Baa K.K. and supervised by FranklinCovey Japan.
  So can we trust them?

 There was information on a previous work by the same manufacturer [7 Keys https://7habits-gameshop.com/shopping/lp.php?p=7habits-game#lpshoppingcolumn]
  At 21,600 yen, the price tag is several times higher than similar board games, which is very suspicious.
