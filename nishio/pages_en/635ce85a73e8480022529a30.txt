conjugation
The original form before it was rewritten to "[conjugate]" because it is not in [Joyo Kanji].
I remember when I lost track of whether it's "Kyoyaku" or "Kyoyo" or "Kyoyu" or "Kyoyo" or "Kyoyaku.
With this character, it's easy to remember that it's "yaku" because it has "yaku" on it.

What is a yoke?
