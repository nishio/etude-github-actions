 *1207706217* at the Prudential Tower
 
 The restroom is very crowded. I've been waiting for six minutes already. I have a stomachache.
 
 It's quiet. I knocked, but you didn't answer.
 
 -----
 
 I knocked louder and it came out. If you want to sleep, you should avoid toilets with only one private room.
 
 *1207722810*[AS3]Passing arguments with GET
 I was looking for a way to pass arguments from the outside to Flash, I thought it would be in an object tag like Java Applet, but it looks like you can get the content passed with GET.

 log(root.loaderInfo.parameters.hoge);

 Now if you write ?hoge=1 or something like that, 1 will be output.
 
 -----
 
 However, this would cause hoge to be null when trying to write the rest in Rascut. You will have to write it in the following way.
 >||
   var url:String = root.loaderInfo.parameters.url;
   if(url == null){
     url = "http://localhost:3001/img/20080409_130308_239768.png";
   }

 But, oh well.
 
 *1207728868*[AS3] Stumbling blocks for people moving from other languages.
 - When I load and display an external image, it is somehow scaled up or down on its own.
 -- stage.scaleMode = "noScale";
 -- stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE; would be better
 - The upper left corner coordinates are not (0, 0)! It's something like 100 pixel minus!
 -- stage.align = StageAlign.TOP_LEFT;
 - The coordinate values aren't integers. I bet it's a single or double precision floating point number.
 -- No, 1/20 pixel units. Fractions are rounded down, so if you use it as if it were a floating point, errors will accumulate and it will gradually shift to the upper left.
 
 So far I have stumbled on about three of these points.

 How about reprinting this on Nico Nico Douga without permission, and then let's all have a constructive discussion in the comments. lang:ja

 Where can I buy this?
 
 *1207738047*Difficult/Easy
 I still have no idea what DP(Dirichlet Process) is useful for, I know DP(Dynamic Programming), I know GM(Gaussian Mixture) faintly, I knew GM_setValue as soon as I saw it.
 
 I guess it would be more fun to have the ability to know everything immediately.
 
 -----
 
 The value set by GM_setValue is valid across tabs, so conversely, GMs that seem to be used to set flags must be used on only one tab.
 
 *1207741315* Does a change in quantity lead to a change in quality?
 I suddenly wondered if I could see a world I had never seen before, so I decided to increase my followings on Twitter by one digit. I've been mostly following back, but now I'm going on the offensive. I wonder what kind of change it will bring.
 
 *1207755639* Well
 
 The last train has run out. I can take the JR train back to Kinshicho, so I guess I'll walk from there.
 
 *1207756928*Ochanomizu
 
 The Sobu Line train has finished. I was told.
 
 *1207760535*I'm home.
 I ended up taking a cab back from Tokyo Station.

 TAKESAKO neta Flag that you are going to stay at Ochanomizu University by any chance?
 <<
 
 Let's see, I'm serious about the story.
 >>
 The predecessor school was located in Ochanomizu (Yushima 3-chome, Hongo Ward)[1], but moved to its current location after the Great Kanto Earthquake
 <<
 <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%8A%E8%8C%B6%E3%81%AE%E6%B0%B4%E5% A5%B3%E5%AD%90%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6">Ochanomizu University - Wikipedia </a>
 
 Therefore, there is no Ochanomizu University in Ochanomizu.

 And with the intention of increasing the 300 FOLLOWING to 3000, I went a little overboard and increased it to 4700. So far, I haven't had my account suspended or anything. And the quality doesn't seem to have changed.

 You might be able to find it by looking around <body>FlashVars, ExternalInterface. I believe you can also change the value from FireBugs. </body>
