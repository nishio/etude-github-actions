Looking for reasons not to
If you see someone doing something on social networking sites and feel compelled to write "why you are not doing it," you often feel an unconscious "[guilt] for not doing it," and you create a "reason [not to do it]" after the fact to pretend that it is not there.

relevance
　Most people don't care about what you don't
　　There is a limit to what people can do, so the latter is by far the greater number of "things we do" versus "things we don't do."
　　So the latter is less informative.
　　Relatedly, "thinking of doing", "doing", and "did" are more informative later.
