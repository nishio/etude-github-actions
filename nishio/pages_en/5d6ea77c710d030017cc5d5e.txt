Essential Graphics motion graphics templates with clip nesting, subclips, multi-camera source sequences, legacy titles, and Beziers in the title

Difference between clip keyframes and track keyframes, "Linked Selection" button, right-click to sync asynchronous indicators, clipping indicator, distinction between gain and volume, wet and dry, essential sound panel to adjust conversation, dynamics operations

I would like to know how to solve the phenomenon that when there is a clatter and collision sound mixed in the middle of a conversation, the conversation sound doesn't go up even if normalized at the peak.

The idea of hoping that the Essential Sound Panel's conversation adjustment will be good, the parametric equalizer will drop the high frequencies, and the adaptive noise reduction with a smaller sampling window will pick up the collision noise... is difficult, or there must be noise at the beginning of the clip.

Use of proxy files seems useful

It is still correct that you should try to edit the video yourself at least once. If you talk or chat while looking down, it is hard to determine what is necessary for the content and what is not, and it is time-consuming to have to ask every time, so you should try to make it at the time of shooting the video to make it an editing point later. For example, if you raise your hand to the camera or say "yes," it would make it easier to know the editing point just by the waveform and thumbnail.

It is very easy to edit afterwards! What are you going to do?" with an action is very easy to edit later.

I told my wife that I had a technique to mark the waveforms by hitting an oak hand.

-Fixed camera should not sway (use a sturdy tripod, etc.)
-Stable when parallel to the horizon, not at an angle to the desk.
-The top of the head may be too close up to cut off the frame.
