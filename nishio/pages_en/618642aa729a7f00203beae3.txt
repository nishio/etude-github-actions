[knack] and [insatiable].
[Motivation and progress

The left side sees motivation as uneven, and progress is dependent on it, so progress is uneven.
On the right side, progress is generated by less uneven methods such as "habit" and "I feel bad if I don't do it, so I do it.

[Obsolete]
　Some decrease over time.
　　Some knowledge is prone to obsolescence.
　　Achievements are less likely to become obsolete.

　　Even if the same Y is produced in the absence of obsolescence, obsolescence makes a difference.
　　　If the cost of turning 95% into 100% is less than 10% of the cost of turning 50% into 100%.
　　　　A slightly clearer expression: if the cost of catching up is greater than linear with respect to the width of the catch-up, then
　　　　Catching up frequently is less expensive than catching up after the gap widens.
　　Achievements in the brain do not become obsolete, but rather [the past is] beautified.
　　　[Outward achievements] like winning a contest or releasing a piece of software will no longer change as a fact.
　　　　But the value people perceive for it is basically decreasing.
　　　Achievements that are not outside are not exposed to the wind and snow, so they overestimate their value.
　　　[The old man's "I've done it before" is worthless.]
