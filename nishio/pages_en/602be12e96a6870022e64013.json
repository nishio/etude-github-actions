I don't know if there's a better abbreviation for this. I tentatively read it as [g's curve top], but I'm not sure if it's called a curve top in English.
With Recessed Stud is the best feature, so maybe "[dent curve]" or something.

In brickers, slope > curved slope, not [block] > [curved top block].
