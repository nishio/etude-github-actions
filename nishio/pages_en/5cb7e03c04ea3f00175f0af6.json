The disease of saying abstract things and thinking you know what you're talking about.

Bad Patterns] of Human Thought
"What is X?" â†’X is Y!"

He thinks he has said something noble, but there is practically no substance.
	Is there a way to verify "X is Y?"

concrete example
	I was thinking about [what digestion is].
	Specific example: If a method is beneficial, there must be a principle that makes it beneficial, and you want to take it out. For example, "write it down and make it disappear," "increase input speed by making it easier to list," "compress information by grouping it bottom-up," etc.
	I saw this and thought, "Digestion is abstraction!" I thought.
	I thought this thought was futile.
		Can the expression "[digestion is] an abstraction" be applied to real problems?
	We've gone a step further with the term "[abstraction]" [over-abstraction].
	Of certain specific "method implementations", there are sub-methods to achieve sub-goals rather than the final goal.
		Write it down" for the goal of "making the information indelible."
		"Listability" for the goal of "increasing the speed of information input."
		Grouping from the bottom up" for the goal of "compressing information."
