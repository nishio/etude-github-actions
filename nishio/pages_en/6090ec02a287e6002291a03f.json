 I have exhibited the following. I was in the Dentsu Unexplored group (a team of Unexplored Youth alumni who are not related to the University of Dentsu), and we were at a table adjacent to the Dentsu Unexplored group (a team of Unexplored Youth alumni who are related to the University of Dentsu), but we ended up mixing and matching places quickly. Others were.
 - Like inajob's <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/inajob/20091122'>Air Piano</a>.
 - Kyoro's <a href='http://alpha.mixi.co.jp/blog/?p=386'>mixi Engineers' Blog &#187; online coffee maker "Moekatan"</a> and so on.
 - Like id:tgbt game autoplay.
 - Like id:TOKOROTEN's life game that can be physically interfered with.
 - Like id:nyaxt's mixer.
 - Like masa-u's black and white external monitor.
 - Like SoftEther and Vivian's <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfSOHaKReU0'>YouTube - personal motion capture technology "Kuma"</a>.
 
 On the first day, there was an incident of smoke emission from a drum roll at the current osugi, and the power went out to reconnect the wiring. I had no choice but to take a break and look around. Normally, I am not able to look around because I am doing demonstrations all the time, but I thought that I should prepare for a one-hour break from now on.
 
 So I made a movie with Japanese commentary by editing a standing video on the train on the way to the second day of the tour.
 <object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rQueLwrrhSc&hl=ja_JP&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rQueLwrrhSc&hl=ja_JP&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
 It was played during a break on the second day.
 
 Normally, I would explain everything, but on the advice of a professional magician, I displayed the magic without giving away the story. I had never done magic before, but it was quite interesting, and I was not expecting the kind of thrusts I got, such as "Try jumping a little," "What happens if you do it while shaking hands," and "(Put my business card on the touch panel) Try it with this," etc. I was quite surprised.
 
 Do you sell it?" I only explained it to them when they asked me, but you can buy it normally at the AppStore. I realized during the process that this was the best proof that the device had not been modified. Maybe I should have been a little more aggressive in my appeal. AppBank introduced it at just the right time: <a href='http://www.appbank.net/2009/11/24/iphone-application/67516.php'>iTheremin: Theremin on iPhone It's a reality...? 1811</a>.
 
 Some of the other presentations I looked around at were interesting. First, the Tesla coil speakers were very cool. Also, that ozone smell is something you have to go see in person. The 3D theater was also very low tech and much more immersive than any 3D theater in town that you can pay for! I was impressed by the ingenuity and ingenuity of the "Make" team. I told the other members of the group who hadn't been to the planetarium at all to go and see it. and made them go see the planetarium. I am sorry for those who came to the unexplored group in the last hour and were disappointed to find no one there.

 After the second day, I was in a big hurry to go to <a href='http://www.cyclicblue.com/c3b/'>Shihua Arsenal</a> and buy a bismuth ingot. I was playing with it earlier and was impressed again. (I'll write about it later.)
