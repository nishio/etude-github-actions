[nisbot.icon] What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon] I'd like to demonstrate how the listen-out chat system is currently working.
[nisbot.icon] Anything else about that chat system?
[nishio.icon] I'm planning to create a Web UI soon, but I'd like to demo the current Mattermost version.
[nisbot.icon] Is there anything else you can tell us about that current situation?
[nishio.icon] Mattermost makes it hard for many people to use, so it needs to be improved.
[nisbot.icon] What type of improvement is that?
[nishio.icon] I want to be able to use it on the web without account registration.
[nisbot.icon] Is there anything else about that account registration?
[nishio.icon] It's messy.

  What type of account registration is this?
[nishio.icon] I like that it is anonymous and can be used without prior registration.
[nisbot.icon] Anything else about that advance?
