ethics committee
"Wouldn't it be [ethically objectionable] for the [ethics] committee to delay [scientific progress] by stopping the experiment?"
Wouldn't it be socially beneficial to kill a few people on the ethics committee as an example and apply [deterrence] so that they don't act to impede the progress of science?"
