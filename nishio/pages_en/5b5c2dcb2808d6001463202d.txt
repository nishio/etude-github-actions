[*** the flow of this book]

　Chapter 1, "How to Learn Something New," considers how to learn something for which there is no [correct] answer. It details how to learn by turning [cycles] so that you can apply them to situations, rather than memorizing them. #Learning Cycle

　In order to turn the learning cycle around, you need "[motivation]" as fuel. Chapter 2, "How to Get Motivated," explains how to stay highly motivated, based on data from over 12,000 unmotivated people. #TaskManagement

　We want to remember what we have learned. Chapter 3, "How to Train [Memory]," explains how the hardware called the brain works, the results of experiments on how we learn, and how to efficiently consolidate memories made possible by software. #Interval Repetition Method

　Many people buy too many books and end up with piles of them. In Chapter 4, "How to Read Efficiently," we will consider how to improve the efficiency of information input, especially in [reading books], by comparing [speed reading] techniques and slow reading methods.

　Chapter 5, "How to Organize Your Thoughts," is about output. We tend to think "learning = input," but it is important to output and verify. However, as the amount of knowledge increases with a lot of input, it becomes difficult to organize it and communicate it to others. Since humans cannot copy the entire knowledge in our brain to others, we need to work on cutting, bundling, rearranging, and converting the [knowledge network] in our brain into words and diagrams. In this chapter, I will explain how to "summarize" a lot of inputs into a form that can be output to others, based on Jiro Kawakita's "KJ method" and my writing method.

　Many people think that intellectual production is a way to come up with new [ideas]. I believe that "coming up with ideas," "deepening understanding," and "discovering patterns" have some elements in common. In Chapter 6, "How to Come Up with Ideas," we will consider how to come up with and realize ideas. #NewCombination

　There are many other things I would like to talk about, but the number of pages is limited. In chapters 1 through 6, I assume that the "what" (what to learn) is already decided, and I explain the "how" (how to learn). However, I believe that "what" is a more important question than "how. In Chapter 7, "How to Decide What to Learn," I will consider this question.
