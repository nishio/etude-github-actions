 Duplicate paths when selecting and grouping paths and stickies
 　When grouping, it removes the selected item from the existing item, because "existing item" is a path and the selected item is a group containing paths?
 　Reverse.
 　Should this be fixed at the grouping or not...
 　A situation where a path group with 1 element and a single path can be mixed.
 　　Not good...
		The duplicate path issue is tricky, so I'll have to put devtool in there first.
	Ungrouped when pasting
		Because the selected path is not a group.
		Should I group them when pasting?
