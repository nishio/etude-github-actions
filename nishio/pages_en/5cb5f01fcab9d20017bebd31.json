> Certain techniques have been very helpful in improving my abilities.
>After solving one motivating problem, solve the same problem again from the beginning, relying only on the "insights" you gained at that time. This process is repeated until the solution is as clear and direct as possible. In this way, we find rules for solving similar problems that are general enough to allow us to approach a given problem from the beginning in the most effective way. Such rules are often of permanent value.
