Seems to be a granddaughter's introduction to the log data analysis.
I'm wondering where I can get the log data.
　ruffian
　　If it's a two-person game, the genshu route is too slow.
　harbor
　　Sustained draw and purchase, strong in combo or stero
　governor
　　It's a strong card when you collect it, so you probably need to buy it to keep it from being occupied on one side.
　Border Village
　[Jousting]
　　Reward card, what?
　European magpie (Pica pica)
　　It's a cantrip, so I don't mind having it, and I don't like it when people collect them.
　[mobile zoo: bounty hunter]
　　Increase purchasing power while compressing
　silk merchant
　　Accident prevention by villagers with financial resources
		[Renaissance: Silk Merchant]4 +2 draw +1 when buying/acquiring or discarding, +1 treasure +1 villager
　Adventure: Farmer
　　Two-person games tend to be long games because it's hard to end up with a dead genus state, and when that happens, the teacher's token effect is significant.
　Adventure: Knight Apprentice
　　Champion action infinite attack disabled
　　Warrior's [Handes] is also disgusting.
