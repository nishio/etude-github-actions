Which should take precedence over strengths and values?

 Drucker.
  We should not spend too much time improving what we are not good at. We should concentrate on our strengths. It takes much more energy and effort to bring incompetence up to the same level than it does to bring the best up to the very best.
		If your strengths and values don't match, you won't feel like you're making a contribution.
