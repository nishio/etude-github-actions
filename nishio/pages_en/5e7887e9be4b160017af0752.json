Unresolved but interesting subject.

>I have a feeling that "0 to 1" and "[team building] skills" are "different" and "independent" or "negatively correlated," but in several meetings over the past few weeks, conversations have been based on the unspoken assumption that they are correlated, and I've wondered, "What? Is the world's perception that there is a positive correlation between the two?" I'm confused.
