Awareness that you are also content
The idea that there is a [shared knowledge pool] and that enriching it is a [public good
I share that philosophy, but note that some people don't seem to.

 > Not so much to be offended, but sometimes people ask questions addressed to me and then delete them when they are done with them (as happened recently), and I find that kind of thing disappointing. I am not answering just for you. I'm answering because there are other people who would benefit from reading that Q&A!

	This story is interesting. The angle of "whether or not you are aware that you are also a content".

 > It would be a waste to think of "transmission" as "a means to satisfy a need for approval" and it would be interesting to think of it as "transmission is to create an asset that does not yet exist on the Internet". There is a lot of information that you can't understand unless you ask people, and in fact, there is still not enough information on the Internet. The visualization of the existence of a person like myself can be useful to others.
