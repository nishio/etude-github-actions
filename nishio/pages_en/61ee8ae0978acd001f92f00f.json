If I provide [useful] information, will I get [something] in return?
 [/villagepump/disadvantages of information disclosure should also be properly considered], "[If I provide useful information, will I get something in return?" Regarding [/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　The word "beneficial" seems to have a low resolution.
　　Who is it beneficial to?
　　In the market transaction metaphor, "customer perceived benefit" is measured by "how much the customer is willing to pay to get it.
 　　So if you don't get something in return, then it wasn't beneficial.
 　　　It means that it was not beneficial to the customer "to the extent that they would be willing to pay for it."
 　　　This payment is not limited to monetary.
 　　　　This includes hitting the like button and writing comments.
 　　To what extent is the market transaction metaphor valid[/villagepump/yosider.icon]?
 　The amount the buyer pays is not equal to the amount the seller receives.
 　　Because of [transaction costs].
 　　For example, if you like something on Twitter, the sender is paid 10 yen.
 　　　When this is debited together with communication charges by carrier billing even if no procedures are taken
 　　　If you have to enter your credit card number each time
 　　　The amount received is the same, but the volume of transactions concluded is lower in the latter.
  　For those who don't yet use Scrapbox, it's a crazy costly pathway to "being asked to put your Google password into a service you don't understand".
  Talk about not getting the expected return? [/villagepump/inajob.icon].
  　I feel like we need to design it so that it's easy to get the return we want to get.
