[The "Wearable Blanket" has the image of a flat blanket that you are forced to wear, but this is a jacket made of blanket material.

 When I slept wearing Muji's Wearable Blanket Jacket (made of blanket material and shaped like clothing), "my shoulders stick out from the futon and I feel cold" no longer happens, and when I get up and get out of the futon, the blanket warmed by my body heat follows me and I don't feel "too cold to get out of the futon," which is what a winter blanket should be like. I think this is what a winter blanket should have been. I think this is what a winter blanket should be.
 It is cold when it is time to get out of the futon and change clothes, but wearing a wearable blanket allows you to make warm tea, turn on a hot carpet, or eat breakfast while wrapped in a blanket that warms to your body temperature, and then change clothes after your body warms up.

 May be too hot at times.
