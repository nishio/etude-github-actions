 Oh, I completely forgot that I had an errand to run at 6pm. It's only 5:10 p.m., so I'll make it, but I wonder if there's anything I can do to get my schedule out of my head this quickly.
 
 Note from cell phone. It was a phone call about another matter that reminded me. Phone call -> something happened -> I had an appointment! And so on.

So, I bought a TOEIC book at the bookstore in front of the station the other day, and I thought it would be a waste if I didn't use it, so that's why I decided to use it.

 Too bad. I heard "A man is working in the office." and thought, "No, he's not walking, he's sitting.

 I thought it was no good after listening to part 2. I thought it was pointless to go through to the end, so I checked my answers on the way to the end and found that 16 out of 40 questions were wrong. I thought it was pointless to do it until the end, so I checked my answers on the way to the end and found that I got 16 out of 40 questions wrong.
