 **1299395132*About New Graduate Preparation Calendar Spring 2011
 There is an interesting project called <a href='http://atnd.org/events/13324'>New Graduate Preparation Calendar Spring 2011 : ATND</a> in which I am participating, and I Tweeted what I thought after writing the manuscript and seeing other people's reactions to it. I'll reprint it so that it doesn't drift away.

 There is no guarantee that what the sender writes is also good for the recipient, even if the sender intends it to be good for the recipient. An extreme example is when the sender is into religion. Therefore, the sender should not assume that he or she is transmitting a "good way of life. He can only talk about "the way he believes to be a good way of life" and "the results of that way of life.

 There are good times and bad times in life. There are people in the world who are both optimistic and pessimistic about life. Some people write negative sentences when they are feeling negative and make the feelings of those around them negative, while others shut up when they are negative and speak up when they are positive and make the feelings of those around them positive.

 I wrote the manuscript with the reader in mind, but wouldn't you rather have a follow-up on the author's part? There is no right way to live, and everyone has only lived once, so they only know the world as they see it. And yet, because of the immunity of the age difference, we can expect to see eight-tracked responses from frustrated middle-aged and older people who are taking the form of a counterargument that the world is not so sweet.

 Which opinion is "generally correct" is impossible for those of us who only live once to judge. We can't even judge what people around us are like. Because positive people gather around positive people and negative people gather around negative people. But there is an easier way to judge. To be continued...

 Segue:You can't judge whether an opinion about life is right or wrong. But "how" is another thing. If he describes "how to improve your life" along with his opinion, you can test it yourself to see if it is correct or not. If not, we can only accept his opinion without evidence or ignore it without evidence.

 **1299409297*Pomodoro Continued
 The D part of PDCA, "measure for 25 minutes and concentrate during that time" of Pomodoro, is still going on, but since I'm not doing P and C, inevitably I'm not doing A either. That's no good. What should I do?
 
 For now, task management is being written in ~/todo.howm in an appropriate format, and as usual, the task list is overflowing with things that are not necessary to be done, so it is sometimes moved to ituka.howm, where it is piled up with no salted reviews. I'm going to move all the contents of todo to ituka, and from now on todo will be a Pomodoro-like task list.
 
 I also need the activity inventory and the files for recording... I'll create a folder in Dropbox called pomodoro and put them in there. The todo.howm above is also in Dropbox, and I put it in ~ with ln -s. You may be able to tell by the extension, but I'm using "howm" for this. But I don't use it as howm. I don't go to the top page of howm and jump from there because I want to look at TODO immediately when I want to look at it. I just go to ~/todo.howm and open it directly.
 
 To be continued after dinner.
