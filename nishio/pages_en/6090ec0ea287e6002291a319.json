 I wanted to extract text from a web page in Python, so I googled and found our company's Nakatani's <a href='http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/blog/nakatani/2007/09/web_1.html'>web page text extraction (nakatani @ cybozu I found a port of Nakatani's <a href='https://github.com/yono/python-extractcontent'>yono/python-extractcontent</a> to Python (<a href='https://github.com/yono/python-extractcontent'>yono/python-extractcontent</a>), so I tried using that for now. But it failed to extract the body text and returned an empty string for this blog, which has a Google Ad Section and is supposed to have a 100% success rate.

 No, if you want to break lines in the middle of a regular expression, you need the VERBOSE option. (?isx), or add re.VERBOSE in re.compile, or split the string to prevent line breaks.
 
 I was about to make a pull request, but it showed Fork 5 or something like that, and when I checked it, I found that it had been modified at the forked site.

 So I concluded that those who are going to extract the text should use this one. https://github.com/petitviolet/python-extractcontent
 
 Lesson to myself: just because you come to the top of a Google search doesn't mean you're the most maintained.
