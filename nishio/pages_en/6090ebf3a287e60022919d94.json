 Hmm, is the code I wrote in jQuery properly formatted? Is there something wrong with my operation?
 
 >|javascript|
 $(document).ready(function(){
 		$(".addtag").click(function(e){
 				$("#tag_text").remove();
 				$(this).before("<input type='text' id='tag_text'>");
 			var tag = $("#tag_text");
 ||<
 
 Why would you DEDENT there?

 For what it's worth, the printf issue is gradually gaining recognition.
 There is still a strong opinion that it's a ball, but I wonder if there is a gradual increase in opinion that "No, I think it's a strike." I wonder if there are more and more people who are saying, "No, I think it's a strike.
 Let's give it another day or so.

 I made an account anyway.
 I tried out the PC version of the quiz, and it's rather good because I can control it with the keyboard, and I can skip over the "I already know that word, so you don't have to say it" by just pressing enter.

 Oh, some courses have dictation?
 
 And if you choose the GRE Verbal advanced course, the dictation is too difficult to understand orz

 Hoh, you can do it on a cell phone with Flashlite?
 
 The mobile version, the type that generates a unique URL for each user, also spit out a QR code, so I could go to my page just by taking a picture.
 The fact that dictation operations can be done entirely with the keyboard gave me the impression that the company was seriously considering "good design" in terms of user interface.

 I also created an account with amachang, so we became friends. Oh, I can see how much he has tried and how much he has solved, and what his current dictation level is. This might be exciting.

 I tried the hardest one out of the blue and almost failed, but for the easier ones, you can skip the meaning of words you already know by pressing Enter, and you can quickly select your choices with the keyboard. The questions are well thought out, with "N/A" sometimes appearing in the choices, or a choice that has not appeared before, and at the end of the set, you are asked to write down whether or not you understood the question correctly. And you have a proper calendar to show how many you've done. This makes me think that I have to solve at least one every day. Nice design.

 I made a typo, thinking "get stuck" was like "get st*ck".

 I figured out what an "item under study" is. It seems that words, phrases, and other such clusters are items. I accumulated 25 items just by playing one course. After a while, the questions would come up again, and if I answered them correctly, my "proficiency level" would increase, and when it reached 100%, the course was complete.
 
 ---
 
 Wow, the item under study is losing out to amachang, which started later.

 I have to go home...

 I tried to write a diary and a few other things, but while the interface of the main unit is very well done, the interface of the diary and messages is terrible.
 Everyone should create an English account on Twitter. Or you can talk English all the time on your current account. Anyway, someone follow me! I don't like being alone. (←I learned it today.) http://twitter.com/nishio_en

 Dictation important.
 
 I'm already sleepy...

 <body>The remaining version in the Web Archive is ver1.0, which is quite old, so we recommend that you download the latest version from <br>http://www.brgeight.se/. <br>The current latest is 2.0β8. <br>That should fix the indentation problem. <BR><BR>By the way, I use Meadow, and 2.0β8 causes problems, so I use 2.0β7. </body>
