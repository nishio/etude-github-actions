Not in the dictionary sense, of course.
Suppose a book devotes one section to a word X and explains
　The meaning to which this word X refers is, of course, not the [dictionary meaning] of X.
　Because if you want to refer to the dictionary meaning of X, just cite the entry for X in the dictionary.
　The observed fact that the author devotes paper and effort to explain the meaning of X strongly suggests that the meaning to which X refers is not the dictionary meaning of X

I was going to title it "Naturally [non-parallel symbols]," but I thought this would be easier to understand.

concrete example
　[COMPREHENSION], the author himself uses it with "UNDERSTAND", so it should not be translated as "understanding" in an English-Japanese dictionary.
　　This is why we have chosen to express the special meaning of the word in English capitalization without translation
　[Conviviality], the author himself writes in the preface, "Not in the dictionary sense."
