Links to faraway places
	I like [far-reaching links].
		Define "far."
			On Scrapbox, the link is already displayed as a link up to 2 hops away on the existing link.
			It is preferable to link to a page 3 hops or more ahead that is not included there

After writing this and re-reading it an hour later, I realized that "[link to a different project]" is exactly "far away".
