[Resilience]
 How can we overcome the feeling of "avoiding action for fear of failure?" #RiskAversion
 How do you create [self-efficacy]?
 How do you get out of [learned helplessness]?
 What should we pay attention to in order not to be hurt by [failure] and to learn from it?

 I wrote a feature article on the 22nd, something like "Confidence comes from results, so we must first take action toward results.
 	I think it's about [how engineers learn http://gihyo.jp/lifestyle/feature/01/engineer-studying] #howengineerslearn
 	The highest priority for personal growth is [the pursuit of excellence], from which comes fulfillment and confidence. From there comes fulfillment and confidence." Drucker
 How to build self-efficacy that this book introduces
 	[Success Stories]

>"The world's elite value more than IQ and education!" I read this book and wondered what it was about because I've never heard of the term at all, despite the incendiary phrase "the world's elite value IQ and education more than IQ and education! I read about how to overcome the feeling of "avoiding action for fear of failure," how to create self-efficacy, how to escape from learned helplessness, and what to watch out for in order not to be hurt by failure but to learn from it.
>In my feature article on the 22nd, I wrote, "Confidence comes from achievement, so we must first take action to achieve results. But people with extremely low self-efficacy respond by saying, "That's because I'm a successful person, and I won't succeed even if I take action. The book introduces four ways to create self-efficacy, one of which is to experience success, and the other three are "vicarious experience by observing the experiences of others who are successful," "positive suggestion from others," and "physiological upliftment.
>There is also the benefit of a programming language learning workshop-like atmosphere, a "festive exuberance from getting together and writing programs" and a "vicarious experience from watching someone else's work being done right alongside them," which increases self-efficacy?
