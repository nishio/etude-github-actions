Cookie clicker-like game
Considering Design
　Elements that increase on their own
　　Play time
　Original also automatically increases cookies, but I want to stop.
　Resources available only in 1 Pomodoro run.
　Harvesting is possible only between 20 and 30 minutes after the timer starts
　　Will someone repeat the harvest in 20 minutes?


　You could say that the actual performance is when the KPI reaches 2^N.
　　[False progress].
　　progress indication

　There are resources that increase when accessed on different days.
　　Incentive to access daily.
　　Use it as a resource or make it a condition for unlocking something.
　　　Research and stuff.

Local storage? Cloud storage?
　Want to use it offline?

I'd like to make it optional to make it look like a game.

Can be manually converted and micromanaged.
Can be automated when it becomes a hassle.

Granma consumes one of the most food and makes two cookies.
1 Pomodoro
Granma can be worked once per pomodoro.

Miner consumes 5 cookies and gets 1 coal
　Efficiency will improve in the future.

Power plant consumes 10 coal to produce 1 electricity
　Can increase the efficiency of grammars and miners while electricity is available.
　Do you need research to be able to build a power plant?

The pomodoro you get per day is limited, so it's going to take a few days to get to this area.
