They reject the fact that they can live under their own decision making from this moment onward, interpret the natural fact that "parents are not perfect" as "parents are bad", and by continuing to hate their parents, they think as if "they could not make any choices", and they have finished inventing an institution to escape responsibility somewhere.
Interesting that there are more different reactions than I thought there would be about this statement.
Observe how they reacted later.
