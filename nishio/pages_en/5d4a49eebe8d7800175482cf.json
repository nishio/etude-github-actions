slido style
	Experienced in [Shenzhen study group] in 2019.
ã€€Instead of the speaker talking about the content of the lecture material, the participants have watched the video in advance, and the style is to have a Q&A session for the entire two hours on site. Interesting.
	You can post your questions at https://www.sli.do/ with the hashtag
		Only hashtags need to be shared at the venue.
		Everyone can text in from their phone or PC.
		Unlike oral, you can formulate questions at your own pace.
		I can release my working memory by pressing the submit button when I am able to verbalize my question.
	You can also "Like" other people's questions.
		Can be sorted in order of most likes.
	The problem that sometimes occurs in a normal Q&A session, where the first person to raise his or her hand starts talking about his or her own theory for a long time, is unlikely to occur.
	Question and answer communication does not have to be audio.
		[Voice communication] is inefficient because only one person can output at a time
			Groupware principles that make communication more efficient by making it electronic.
		More efficient by eliminating the wait time to carry the microphone to the questioner.
		This time, the moderator at the venue looked at the list of questions and chose questions as appropriate.
			There was also a flurry of additional questions that the moderator came up with on the spot.
		With slido, you start with "a lot of questions written out," so you don't need to wait for someone to raise their hand.
	Even if only the Q&A portion of a regular lecture is replaced with a slido-style presentation, the customer value will increase.
