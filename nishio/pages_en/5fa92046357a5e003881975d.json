number of events (e.g. accidents, crimes, meetings, housing starts, hits on a web page)
An inversion of a sequence in computer science and discrete mathematics is a pair of terms in that sequence such that the components of those terms are out of their natural order.
[$ \mathrm{inv}(A)=\#\{(A_{i},A_{j})\mid i<j{\,\,\mathrm{ and }\,\,}A_{i}>A_{j}\}]

The number of overturns in the combined column x+y is obtained from the respective number of overturns f and the frequency table c [ACLPC L] [PAST4K].
	[$ f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + \sum_i\sum_j c(x, i)c(y, j)[i > j] ]

obtained by O(NlogN) using [Fennic tree].
 code:python
  init(N)
  inv = 0
  for a in seqs[i]:
      bit_add(a, 1)
      inv += bit_sum(N) - bit_sum(a)
