2021 Unexplored Junior Boost Conference
The 2021 [unexplored junior] [Boost Conference] tried a new approach.

I'll sort it out later (after the weekend lecture).
[発表会の非同期化]
[Scrapbox to increase mutual understanding].
[Wiki is good for self-introductions]
[Tool Culture Issue]
Volume of information transmission and sense of liveliness
[正統的周辺参加]

>I think the reason for the success of Unexplored Junior was that there were several Scrapbox heavy users on the management side (the people who create the place).

I think it was essentially important that there be more than one person.
　One person would have created a dictatorial atmosphere.
　An open discussion about "not erasing" between these two men took place.
　　[fairness + groupware].
　　[The "don't erase rule" is too strong.]
　　[The rules are a product of past negotiations].

Quantitatively, the amount of written feedback for each project has increased dramatically.
　I doubt it's more than 10 times as much.
　We knew the day before that the amount of feedback on this scale was high.
　　The amount of feedback is already too much for voice
