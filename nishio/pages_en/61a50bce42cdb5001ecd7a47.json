　After practicing and clearing Blood Sweat & Tears Expert, I tried the other songs I couldn't clear Hard and was usually able to clear them in one shot!
　MICDrop didn't work, but 30 minutes into play, sweat was running down my face and distracting me, so maybe it's a fitness issue.
　I took a break, tried a second time, and cleared it.

	Dupe and UGH, which were almost unplayable, were cleared in one shot on Hard, so it appears that in the process of practicing Expert, the ability not to depend on a specific song was acquired.
	I tried Dionysus Expert and could not clear it even after reducing the speed to 80%.
	　In other words, you can clear Hard with only "song-independent skills" and not even 80% of Expert by itself.

　It's been a long time, but they kept Hard as A.

The activity ring is not closed, so it is an alternative to exercise.

BST updates high score, and S
Fire also updated high score, which is A
Dionysusは維持
And IDOL was no longer clear on Hard.
(Maybe it's not a decline in skills, but a limitation of physical strength.)
