impressions
	Text input for adding stickies is buggy (not usable with thumb shift).
	The bottom of the canvas is cut off about the height of the toolbar.
	Bug with no link icon for some reason.
		It's tedious to scroll through Scrapbox to find the desired link when you see a sticky and want to read more about it.
		Should still be able to jump directly.
	The grouping feature is important, but a list of this size can be kept open.
		The problem is more serious: the text input is buggy and cannot be easily drawn out.
	I'm using stickies like "-> another app" to express "I wrote this, but it would be nice to do this."
	The title alone didn't make sense to me, so I added "pathways of reuse."
		I thought the Scrapbox side should be renamed.
	UI for adding stickies
 	I'm not sure I can Undo the current toolbar on top of the current toolbar.
 	I'll drag stickies instantly, I'll afford what I can.
 	I think adding stickies should be a modal dialog.
	I organized it on the blank screen, but if I want to save it later, I should be able to.
		It's decided after the fact."
		Maybe a "save" on the hamburger menu.
		`window.debug.save("regroup2019", window.app.state)`
			I can accidentally overwrite it.
		Why did you start with a blank screen in the first place?
			Because there's no menu to create a new one.
	And copy/paste, "Copy is fine with the balloon, but what about paste?" So now that we have a generic menu, we can put it there for now.
	I'd love a shortcut key, we have a problem.
	I'd love some feedback that says, "I copied you."
