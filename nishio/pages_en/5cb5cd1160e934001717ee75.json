>[Pleasurable reaction] in [Synectics] (→ "[Compendium of Ideas]", p. 247)
> [Felt sense] in [Focusing] (→ "Compendium of Ideas", p. 27), given that the reason is to choose something that feels right even if you don't instantly know why.
[問題解決大全] P.165

As for felt sense, I wrote about it on p. 204 [(6.2.5.3) Thinking At the Edge: Where Words Still Cannot Be Spoken] of [The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production
	In [Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning], we call it [felt meaning].

>The Area type of the [NM method] (→ "Compendium of Ideas," p. 253) recommends that we dare to link the most distant things together. This is supported, albeit indirectly, by an experiment that shows that concept binding can only be emergent if it combines things that are not similar to each other.

I wrote about the NM method on p. 160 [(5.2.5.2) The NM method focuses on the adversarial relationship] of [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers].
	You are right about focusing on [conflict].
	I disagree with the idea of "conflict" as "something far away", which I added in [There is more than one conflict].

The experiment is Wisniewski 1991, but I couldn't find it in Google Scholar.
I wonder if this is the same person.
