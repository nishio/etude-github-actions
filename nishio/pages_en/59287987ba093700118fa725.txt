When you don't realize that it's not exhaustive.
If you want to solve the problem of "[non-exhaustive]," it is a general opinion that it would be better to [visualize] the [existence of blanks] by presenting a [framework] in a [top-down] manner and saying "try to fill in all of this" instead of a [bottom-up] [KJ method].

When [you] don't [realize] that [it's] not exhaustive
[top-down and bottom-up] [blind spot].
