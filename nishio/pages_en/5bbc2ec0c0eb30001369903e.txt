Self-expression and overflowing of notices
	Close [notification] [communication tool] requires literacy on the part of the person generating the notification
 [Parents' meeting collapses due to chit-chat on line, causing a wave of screams of real trouble! https://sirabee.com/2018/07/14/20161708355/]
  Someone is chatting on line for communication.
  	The person's claim
  		Communication among parents is important.
    What's wrong with parents talking nicely to each other?
    It's not a good idea to turn off notifications when it's a network of contacts.
	  Unaware that they are destroying the "notify me of contact" function of the contact group
 	Separate groups for networking and chatting were created.
  However, the chit-chat resumed in the contact group because "the number of people participating in the chit-chat has decreased".
  	The lack of awareness to come back to it once it's explicitly detached as a nuisance.
   The fact that fewer people are participating in the chit-chat is evidence that fewer people find value in the chit-chat.
   I don't get a lot of attention for what I say, but I want to be noticed.
   So you get a free ride to a group that others are creating for contact.
   Because the contact is important information and everyone is paying attention to it.
   Generating a non-contact notification in the contact group destroys the function of communicating the contact.
   Selfish acts based on [self-aggrandizement
 technical answer
 	Twitter has adopted a "[mute function]"
  	Ability to prevent certain people's posts from appearing on the timeline.
   They will not [unfollow] or [block] you, and they will not know that you have [muted] them.
		Since the problem is with the individual sender, the choice is to stop displaying that individual's postings.
