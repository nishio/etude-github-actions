Picture sharing common areas
[https://gyazo.com/cdb5fe05d78b01c3f69d1e003847e5b7]
1: Both Mr. A's and Mr. B's software have a common function X
2: This looks good to share! Think about it
3: After actually sharing, you realize that what you thought was "common function X" was "very similar functions [$ X_A] and [$ X_ B]".

The reality of XA is complex, yet humans summarize it as "X".
Details are discarded when summarizing.
As a result, it is misidentified as "identical" to a different XB.
　So [cognitive resolution] is down.

The most appropriate description of reality is source code written in a programming language, but we try to express it in a natural language that is ambiguous, polysemic, and subject to shifting interpretations.
　It's only natural that noise would be present here.
