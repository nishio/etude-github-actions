Should we write adoption criteria?

Cons
	People will try to optimize the adoption criteria as written.
	Trying to write to the adoption criteria hinders writing about intrinsic motivation
	In the first place, I myself have not yet acquired a firm belief about what kind of adoption criteria I should take.
Pros
	Know what to look for in advice from the adults around you.
	Can affect 1~2 orders of magnitude more people than adoption, and is beneficial in moving the world in a better direction.
	Writing may bring clarity to my thinking.
