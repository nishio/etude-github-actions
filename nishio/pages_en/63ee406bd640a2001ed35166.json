Need to raise the bottom line?
Tend to implicitly assume that [raising the bottom line] is necessary, beneficial, and
ã€€Is that true?

The bottom is already won. Rather, the U.S. is winning with the understanding that some excellent people are continuing to achieve [moonshots] that have not yet been achieved by mankind, and I want to aim for that.
