There is no one left in the world to take responsibility.

As there used to be a dream that "if there is no one in ChatGPT, it doesn't matter if it is a psychopath or fake news, as long as there is no one in ChatGPT". I think that may be an illusion. Since there is a human intention behind the provision of the service, we can be held responsible in any case. The day a program emerges that can autonomously secure its own resources and smother itself independently of the operator, that could be the anniversary of AI independence, though. I've had those dreams about smart contracts before.

>I don't know, so I'll say something appropriate, but I have a feeling that it would be like a parent's supervisory responsibility for their child. Currently, AI does not have the ability to be responsible (it does not have a personality to begin with), so I think it cannot perform legal acts on its own.

I've been thinking about how if a program eventually repeats interbreeding between programs and creates a program independent of human will, the person who bred it, not the parent program, will be responsible for it or something.

I'll be in a situation where "there's no one left in the world to take responsibility, so there's no way to make them take responsibility".
