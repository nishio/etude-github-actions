depth first search (search algorithm in AI)
Depth-first search for trees should be distinguished from depth-first search for graphs.
The latter should avoid re-visiting a vertex that has already been visited
Easy to implement with recursive calls, but cost of function calls can be an issue

code:python
     def visit(v):
         for c in children[v]:
             parent[c] = v
             visit(c)
 
     visit(root)
code:python
     stack = [root]
     while stack:
         v = stack.pop()
         for c in children[v]:
             parent[c] = v
             stack.append(c)
