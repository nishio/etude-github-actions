The Curse of Success
The curse of "must [succeed]."
When you're trying to do something that is inherently [uncertain] and you have this curse, the cost of [risk aversion] piles up.
Instead of incurring that cost, it would be better to admit that you will largely [fail] and try multiple times.

Even where costs are loaded up for risk avoidance, time is sometimes spent on "work to create an excuse to say that the project was done properly so that it will not be blamed on you in the event of failure. This is what happens when each individual is risk-averse.

We're doing the opposite of [lean startups].

Startups are not well funded and run with the fear that if they do not find customers promptly, they will die.

Individual businessmen are very afraid of losing their jobs. For a salaried worker in a large profitable company with a profitable business, he can eat from the income from existing clients as long as he does not make a big mistake and get fired.

[average orientation is the worst environment].
