Work forgetting why the question is there.
 Only [template] stands alone
 I feel like I've done some work once I've filled out the template.
 Thinking to fill in is important from a quality standpoint.
  People who are in the habit of thinking subconsciously think about the meaning of the question when they see a template question statement.
  People who are not in the habit of thinking just answer the questions and fill in the [blanks].
   They may misunderstand the meaning of the question.
   They may unconsciously switch to questions that are easier to answer.
   They sometimes leave it blank, saying things like, "I don't understand the question."
   Nothing is created by simply answering questions that are easy to answer.

[Inception Deck] or [Lean Canvas], they are good templates, but I don't understand why some people think that just filling them in without learning why they were created will magically create something better.

[Is this an example of "ritualization of means"?
