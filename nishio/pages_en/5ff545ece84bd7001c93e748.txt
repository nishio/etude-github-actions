I used to have a hot carpet until the year before last, but I haven't felt static electricity in winter since I switched to this.
There may be some influence of [elephant thermal humidifier] on this.

A typical hot carpet is rated at 380W.

I used to pull a rug over the hot carpet because the cat might throw up. This is waterproof, so I don't need to pull it down.
Rugs collect cat hair and other debris, but these have a smooth surface that maintains hygiene.
