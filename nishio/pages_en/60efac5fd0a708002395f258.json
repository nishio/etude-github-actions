　　Oh, but this would make the same composition for those who believe that they're not worthy.
　　After all, there is no rational basis for this, but it may be an unspoken assumption that I am worthy.
　　PS [I want to be the kind of person who can be on my own side] and realized that "believing I'm worthy" and "believing I'm not worthy" are not symmetrical compositions.
