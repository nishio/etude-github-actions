 Uenotan: "As a previous study, a person named Goto-san from AIST..."
 Audience: "(Laughs loudly)"
 IRC "I'm the PM in charge!" You were talking about me yesterday at the reception! "Uenotan is cute, Uenotan."
 Dr. Goto: "I'm late to introduce myself...(business card)"
 会場「「(爆笑)」」

 I envy the young people, they are full of dreams and hopes. I can't find anything to focus on. I can't find anything to concentrate on. I feel like I'm floundering around in the water without getting enough oxygen.
 
 *1251037375*Task
 Well, as I mentioned briefly at the boost meeting, I have started work on the server 2 and have left it unfinished to some extent, so I am completely out of my mind as to how far I have come with it. In its prime, this task could be completed in two days, but since the engine's RPMs are not rising even when I step on the gas pedal, I think it will take about four days. So I think I will finish it just in time. I'll also have to go through the documentation...
 
 I want to be able to do a little something consistently every day, not deadline-driven.
