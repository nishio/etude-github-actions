Original Matz's talk in Japanese
>If you look back at how I have read source code in the past, you may find some tips on how to read code to improve your programming skills. The first is to not try to read the whole thing. There is no "story" in the source code, so there is no need to read through the whole thing. It is enough to pick up on the parts that seem interesting and learn from the wisdom of our predecessors. The second is to "read with a purpose. If you read source code with the intention of learning something, you can effectively read and gain knowledge. --- http://www.itmedia.co.jp/enterprise/articles/0712/26/news015.html

>Looking back on what kind of source code I've been reading in the past, there may be hints on how to read the code to improve programming skills. Firstly, "[Do not try to read the whole]". There is no "story" in the source code, so you do not need to read through the whole. It is enough if you pinch interesting places and learn the wisdom of the predecessors. The other is to "[read with purpose]". If you read the source code to learn something, you can effectively understand and acquire knowledge.
