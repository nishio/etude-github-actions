	People who understand [building up] from basic concepts can dig deeper when asked about [abstract concept]☆, "What does that mean?" can answer in depth when asked "What does it mean?
		Related: [People who memorize things by rote can't dig in].
		For example, many people feel repulsed by the katakana words that consultants often use #consulting language
			I know a competent consultant who, when I ask him, "What does that word mean?" and he answers immediately.
				He corresponds to the left side of the figure.
			On the other hand, there are probably some consultants who just hear and use the terminology used by other consultants in the company.
				These types of people can't answer questions.
				This corresponds to the right side of the figure
		This composition is true not only in consulting, but in all fields that deal with knowledge.

	On the other hand, "[Smart people can] explain things clearly" is False

		Figure A can explain the concept ☆ in one step in depth.
			Mr. B can hear that in-depth explanation and understand the concept.
			Mr. C doesn't understand the concept used to explain it because he doesn't understand the concept itself.
		True until "smart people can dig in and explain."
			Whether or not the in-depth explanation is "understandable" is an attribute of the recipient.
			In other words, "the explanation is [easy to understand]" is not an attribute of the explanation alone, but an attribute that depends on the relationship with the intelligence of the receiver
		Even if Mr. A can explain the concept of complex numbers, it is a different story if he can make an elementary school student, who is not even proficient in addition, understand it.
			If you spend enough time and Mr. A digs deeper and deeper to explain it, and Mr. C masters it, you will eventually earn the concept*.
			In many cases, Mr. A or Mr. C does not have the enthusiasm to spend that much time

#Pyramid of Knowledge

I just ended up writing "digging" in Japanese, and the English translation would be delve into or something like that.
>In the following section we inquire more exactly into X
Maybe it would be better to say

[accumulated knowledge and rootless knowledge].
