The definition of a member is the power of exclusion.
>Often you start some organization, it grows, and then the initial purpose starts to fade, right? So it's okay to reaffirm "[the purpose of the organization]," but the [organization] that starts reaffirming "the definition of its members" is doomed to [decline] and disappear. Because the more you try to get the definition right, the fewer people will fit the definition.
> "[Member definition]" is basically "a force in the direction of [exclusion]. It tries to preserve the purity of the values that the current members have. Nothing new is allowed in, and anything that has been altered by the former members that were there is eliminated, and as a result, it has to decline. I sense a similar odor in the definition of "engineer" in some places.
