Imaging at zoom
 As for zooming, it would be good to get the "currently displayed image" and bring it into the process of only zooming in and out of it.
 The image will be a little rough when zoomed in, and there will be white areas around the image when zoomed out, but there should be no practical problem.

		Zoom/Scroll
