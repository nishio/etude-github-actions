Affirmation of Rusantiman
	Response to Drucker's [knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates] type of writing.
	Drucker says X, but my boss says not X. It's inexcusable."
	Cherry-picking from books the evidence that others are not right.
	Since A, who has the power, is not right, I, who does not have the power, am right."
 	[自分の無力の肯定]
 	Composition of [lusantiman
 Only using knowledge gained from books to criticize others, not to transform behavior.
 Drucker himself says [knowledge must be proven by action].
 When you are in such a state of twisted lusantiman, no matter how much you read and gather knowledge, you will not use it in a useful way, so it's sterile.
 	Repeat the pattern of "this book says so and so, and it's inexcusable that he doesn't follow it".
 	The more you do that, the more people around you will leave you.
