Kozaneba Development Diary 2021-11-26
Copy and paste from Regroup doesn't work due to stricter type checking on Kozaneba's part.

If there is too much text, the font size is stuck at 0 and does not enlarge when the kozane is enlarged

I'm usually fine with the rectangular selection, but sometimes there are situations where I want a lasso.

	Hey, the group I dragged disappeared.
		The "somehow uncomfortable" block.
 Either it's gone, hidden, or the coordinates are undefined...
	　Ummm, the data is not lost, it is somehow missing from the list of targets to be displayed, and since I am using the release version, I can't directly modify the list of targets to be displayed.
	　I'll start up a development version later and play around with it.
