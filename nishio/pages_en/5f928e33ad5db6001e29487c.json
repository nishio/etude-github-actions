　Thoughts.
　　Create [suffix array]?
　　String length is 5000 at most, so normal sorting would work.
　　K is up to 5, which is awfully small.
　　If the first line of the suffix array does not get K suffixes, skip the LCPs and go to the next line.
　公式解説
　　Much different policy.
　　Enumerate all subcolumns, sort, uniq
　　That's too slow, so use the fact that you only get K or less to reduce the number of candidates.
　　If you can do it with a suffix sequence policy, that would be lighter.
