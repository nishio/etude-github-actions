Thoughts.
　Known to be a minimum cut related problem, but unclear if the theme is just minimum cut = maximum flow or if the solution is also minimum cut
　The maximum flow when all the blue edges are removed is just a constant, so we can find it first, denoted by the constant F below
　A problem of choosing between "erase or not erase" for the blue edge of a given graph, and setting the maximum flow to F.
　　Since the blue side is 200, 2^200 is impossible, so solving with the smallest cut seems like a good idea?
　　How do we express the constraint that "the maximum flow is F?"
　　Would the answer be to add the edges under the condition of "no increase in maximum flow" from the maximum flow paint-out with all the blue edges removed?
　　　I have a feeling that's not quite true, but let's consider it for once.

 　　Side D increases the maximum flow because S and T are connected when selected
 　　　Should be cut at a cost of 1
 　　　The two infinity sides are redundantly written, and it doesn't matter if you shrink one or the other, but we'll do that later.
 　　Edge C connects S and A when selected
 　　　But A doesn't need to be cut because it doesn't matter if it's S
 　　The same can be said for the edges connected to E and F.
 　　　In this case, one of them should be cut.
　　Unconsciously thinking in terms of the "cutting" metaphor led to a useless design, start over.
　　　The choice to leave an edge or not in the left graph corresponds to whether to paint the vertex red in the right graph
　　　When erasing an edge, pay 1 cost.

　　　Ah, this [bipartite graph with edges as vertices].
　　Is this what you want to do?
