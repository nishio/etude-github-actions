　There is [creator] A.
　A has [made] P.
　There is a [something already made] Q in the world.
　Some people compare P and Q and focus on the lack of P.
　　It is similar to thinking "half empty" when there is [a glass half full of water].
　A is the creator, so if he pulls it up to the level of Q, he will create a new R. There is a person C who thinks
　C is more [fun][nishio.icon].
