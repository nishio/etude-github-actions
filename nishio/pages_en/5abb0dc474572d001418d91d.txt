3 Steps to Knowledge Exchange
Supplement to [Self-Management Strategies for Engineers]. Bite into the three steps to reach a state where [knowledge exchange] is possible.

First, you do not have much knowledge at this point. At this time, you absorb knowledge by asking people around you to teach you about their areas of expertise, or by watching closely and imitating them, which is efficient for you.

On the other hand, even if you are absorbing in this way, those around you lose out by taking the time to teach you. Even if you are watching and imitating without teaching, those around you will only have more degraded copies of themselves, not gain. For those around you to benefit, you need to be able to have and give knowledge that those around you do not have. How can you have knowledge that those around you do not have? One solution to this is to belong to a different community.

(I probably should have added "how?" to the arrow in this figure. The arrows in the other diagrams are time lapses, only this one is different.)

In diagram (2), we are trying to achieve "providing value to those around us" in A by giving the knowledge learned in community B to people in A. In diagram (3), we are trying to achieve "providing value to those around us" in A by giving the knowledge learned in community B to people in A. But if you think about it, the flow of knowledge should be able to be bidirectional. You can mediate information from both communities to the other, keeping people in both communities happy while accumulating your own knowledge.
