Note to Scrapbox
memo

code:js
	Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".o-textNote__link")).map(x=>x.href).join(" ")

Cannot use `wget -i`.

I can do it with requests.
code:python
 def crawl():
     urls = open("urls.txt").read().strip("'").split()
     for url in urls:
         print(url)
         fn = url.replace(PREFIX, "")
         r = requests.get(url)
         print(r)
         open(f"data/{fn}.html", "w").write(r.text)

Embedding other pages by "figure", it's a hassle because it's an iframe.
ã€€If you can use the identifier part of the URL to connect with 2-hops, that's good enough for me.
