>Drucker, in his book "[Postcapitalist Society]," also wrote, "[Knowledge] must be proved [by action] to be knowledge. What we call knowledge today is information for action, information focused on results." He said.

>In his book "Post-Capitalist Society," social ecologist Peter Drucker said of knowledge: "What is now considered knowledge must be proved by action. What is now considered knowledge must be proven by action to be knowledge. What we call knowledge today is information for action, information focused on outcomes." In other words, the idea is that knowledge is closely tied to action and its outcomes. Knowledge should not be separated from action. We must confirm whether the knowledge is useful or not by actually taking action using the knowledge and seeing the results of that action. Knowledge and learning should not be "theoretical.
