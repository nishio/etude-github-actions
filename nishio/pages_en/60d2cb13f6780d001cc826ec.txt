> "Mr. 00 is not responding" to a message with no reply! No one is responding! I have to think and rip!" While we're at it, it's often the case that the parties involved are actually talking directly to each other and resolving the issue.

>> You want me to share information about what the problem is and how it was solved, rather than talking to them directly and putting a dedicated stamp on a problem that has already been solved and letting them know it's been solved, that's right.

I think that if a problem is solved with someone else's help, the person being helped should share the information, but some people are not good at sharing information and it takes time, so I think it's possible to stamp the problem first and share the "solved" information as soon as possible.
