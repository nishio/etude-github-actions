An ordinary man killing a genius
We classify people into three categories according to differences in their evaluation axes.
	I don't think it's very good to label the categories "[genius]," "[brilliant]," or "[mediocre]," because it inflames the emotions.

>The reason [innovation] does not occur in large companies is because they measure the three [axes] with one [KPI].
ã€€[Wrong KPI setting]

The emphasis on empathy is McClelland's [need for affinity].
I am not sure what separates a genius from a brilliant person. Both have a strong desire [for achievement].
Ordinary people are [average-oriented]. Geniuses have their own value axes. The brilliant optimize on a shared value axis.
