Expected DP
	Let f(x) be the expected number of operations from state x to N. f(N) = 0. We want to find f(1)
	Given f(x), find f(x-1)
		Consider one step after the x-1 state
	　P probability of staying at x-1
	　(1 - P) with probability x
	　[$ f(x-1) - 1 = P f(x-1) + (1 - P) f(x)]
	　[$ (1 - P) f(x-1)   =  (1 - P) f(x) + 1]
	　[$  f(x-1) = \left( (1-P) f(x) + 1\right) / (1 - P)]
