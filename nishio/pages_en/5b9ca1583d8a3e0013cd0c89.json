The citation must be consistent with fair practice and within the limits justified for the purpose of reporting, criticism, research, or other citation. Who bears the burden of proof as to whether this "conforms to fair practice"?

 	Rights do not arise without a basis, so there is a need on the part of the author to show a basis.
