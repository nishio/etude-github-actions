 I don't think it's my job to keep the IPSJ Journal or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence for the past several years! That's the job of the library or something!" You have to make up your mind that "It's not my job! I think it was probably 2001 when I joined the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence, so there should be 108 volumes for 9 years.
 
 If you use <a href='http://www.post.japanpost.jp/service/you_mail/use.html'>Yu-mail</a>, you can send up to 3 kilograms for 590 yen or so throughout Japan. If there is someone who wants it, I can give it to them. But that might be a hassle.
 
 In the meantime, I'll make it into a form that can be given to others, sent, or discarded in the near future. I'll probably not do it unless I set a deadline, so I'll do it in February.

 I am in the foreground. My opponent had noticed that the orange was late, but he didn't have any orange tiles on hand, so he put me on hold, thinking that there were other tiles that would give him a higher score and that the orange would come eventually, and then he was blockaded by me. I realized at some point that there were no oranges, so I placed the red and green tiles around the orange clumps on the top edge. I think this game is a game where you should prioritize overcoming weak points rather than aiming for a high score. By the way, once I had six oranges in my hand, I had no choice but to place one of them, and if my opponent had an orange pair of the same color at that time, I could have turned the game around.
