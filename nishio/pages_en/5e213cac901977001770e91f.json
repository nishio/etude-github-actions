Values and Happiness
	Would you be [happier] if you knew more about your [values]?
		Values:
			What do I value?
			What do I want #Desire
			What do you think is [interesting]?
				This definition includes the implicit process of looking for "interesting."
					I personally look for "interesting," but that pretty much correlates with "[learning new skills]."
					There are many people in the world who don't want that.
 You may be surprised at what you value.
 You can't tell someone else what your values are #subjective
