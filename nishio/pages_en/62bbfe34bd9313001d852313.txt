When we examine over 10000 cases of past practice, the number of labels (number of materials) for each theme ranges from 30 to 600 labels per theme. The number of labels (number of materials) for each theme is between 30 and 60 labels, which rarely exceeds 108 labels, the number of troubles in Buddhism.
