Create dark mode compatible pictograms
I made it in Adobe XD as there doesn't seem to be any useful tools yet.

The text is grouped and written out on a 160 x 160 white square with thick black text and slightly thinner white text.

The text as it was was crushed and hard to see because it was used in small pictograms. The white text was also made thicker by adding a 5px border to the original text.
Kerning -150 is used to fill in the spaces between letters.

I just noticed that this font is Javanese, not Japanese! (It seems no harm was done.)

Why have a square if you're not going to display it?
　Text too small to read on screen
　As the size of the image increases, the text becomes smaller, even with the same font size.
　Fix the size of the image by fitting it into a fixed size square
