This is translated as "taste," but I think it means "good taste."

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
heightened sense of taste
lxv 

It can be trained like intelligence. Sufficient knowledge stimulates desire and increases enjoyment. It is possible to know a noble spirit by the exaltation of taste. It must be great to satisfy a great spirit. A great mouthful for a great mouthful, a lofty spirit for a lofty spirit. Before its judgment, the bravest tremble, and the most perfect lose confidence. Few are less important in the first place, as appreciation is rare. Taste is imparted by exchange. It is a great fortune to associate with the best tasters. However, one should not adopt an attitude of dissatisfaction with everything. It is the height of folly, and pretentiousness is more detestable than outlandishness. Some people try to get God to create another world and another ideal to satisfy their fanciful imaginations.
