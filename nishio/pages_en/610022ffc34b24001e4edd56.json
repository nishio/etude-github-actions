The rest is determined by 4. 5 could be 1,4 and 2,3, but the 1,4 line disappears. Therefore, B is 2.

The rest is 3. This determines the right 2 columns C. The only way to divide 6 into two is by 2 and 4, which determines the middle 2 rows D. The only way to divide 6 into two is by 2 and 4, which determines the middle 2 rows D. All that remains is to fill in the rest. Done.
