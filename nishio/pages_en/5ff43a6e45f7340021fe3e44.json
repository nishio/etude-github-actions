Side menu with minimum width
I want to create a side menu of minimal width next to the content.

	Using [Flexbox
	If you do not specify a width for the menu, it will be just about the size of the contents.
		By default, flex-basis: auto
	Specify flex-grow on the content side.
		Default is 0
		This will result in "no menu growth, only content growth.
	I didn't want the menu side to be too tight with that, so I specified padding.
	I added something like width: 20% with my old knowledge before flexbox, but it wasn't necessary.
