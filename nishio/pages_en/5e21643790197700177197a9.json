>[shokai] scrapbox is made as a tool for research, and it is only easier to make discoveries if you use it as a notepad when you have a research attitude towards things. [Perspective], [relevance], and so on. It's not a tool where you can write anything, randomly or throw everything in, etc. and it will be visualized in a good way.
> If you take a research-oriented attitude, you can enjoy not only academic fields, but also hobbies such as cooking, traveling, playing video games, and even work, such as making a list of sales contacts or designing system specifications.
> The goal is not to write in scrapbox, but to use it as a tool to think, discover, and act while writing.
