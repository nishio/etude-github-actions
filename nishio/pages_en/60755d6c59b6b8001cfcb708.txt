Create a system that motivates people to chat with each other.
Consultation on a motivational system in [support mode for proposals to be made].
　I call it the "make proposal support mode," but it can also be used as a "make clarification mode" when you're not in a situation where you have to make a proposal to someone in particular.
　The conversation clarified the target audience, etc.
　　'People who are unmotivated' --> 'People who are unmotivated due to a lack of task organization.'
　summary
　　People who are unmotivated
　　I want to spend my time in a positive way by motivating myself.
　　Due to lack of task organization.
　　So, add a specialized mode to this chat system to dig into the task.
　　The next action for this is to create a draft question in a messy way and use it as a trial.
　　The more we use it, the more we come up with ideas for improvement.
　　By asking questions:.
　　Dig deeper into the task
　　Clarify what you get out of the task
　　Subdivide to the point where the goal is visible.
			I know what to do now.

This mode supports proposals to make [nisbot.icon]. What are you thinking of making?
[nishio.icon]Create a system that motivates people to talk in chat rooms.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of person is that for?
[nishio.icon]People who are unmotivated
[nisbot.icon]What would that person like to see happen?
[nishio.icon]Hope that motivates you.
[nisbot.icon]What would it take for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]I wish I could dig deeper and understand the cause of "lack of motivation".
[nisbot.icon]What kind of things would help you do that?
[nishio.icon]There should be a mode to ask motivation-specific questions in this listening chat system.
[nisbot.icon]What made you think that way?
[nishio.icon]I have been operating a system that motivates users with choice-type answers for a long time, but since it only accepts choices, it does not allow me to dig deeper into the user's task. I wanted to improve the system because I often observed cases where users were unmotivated because they did not understand the task properly.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "motivation" is that?
[nishio.icon]Positive ways to spend your time
[nisbot.icon]
 > I've been operating a motivational system for a long time with multiple-choice answers, but it only accepts choices, so I can't dig deeper into the user's task. We have often observed cases of lack of motivation due to lack of proper understanding of the task, so we wanted to improve the system.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "motivation"?
[nishio.icon]Motivation should not be supreme. Often the task is not appropriate.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "motivation"?
[nishio.icon]Inside the mind
[nisbot.icon]
 > Do not make motivation your supreme priority. Often the task is not appropriate.
 How do you know you are "motivated" to do this?
I'll know when [nishio.icon] comes up.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Do not make motivation your supreme priority. Often the task is not appropriate.
 Where does this "motivation" come from?
[nishio.icon]For example, what you might get as a result of performing a task is very attractive, or what you want to know about it.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "task" is that "task"?
[nishio.icon]This needs to be chewed over more. Cases where people say things like, "I feel like I should study English, but I don't feel motivated to do so," have the wrong definition of the task. It's unclear what would be good about doing that task.
[nisbot.icon]What does that "motivation" look like?
[nishio.icon]Gasoline. Without it, the car won't move forward.
[nisbot.icon]
 > This needs to be chewed over more. The case where you say something like, "I feel like I should study English, but I'm not motivated to do it," is not the right definition of the task. It is unclear what would be good about doing the task.
 Is there anything else about this "task"?
[nishio.icon]Basically, we need to subdivide the task and set reachable goals
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "task" located?
[nishio.icon] in the user's brain or in the user's preferred task management tool.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "task"?
[nishio.icon]How to read the tasks in a task management tool is a difficult question.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its "task"?
[nishio.icon]There's no way for the system to know without some form of input.
[nisbot.icon]
 > How to read tasks in a task management tool is a difficult question.
 Where do these "tasks" come from?
[nishio.icon]There are those that spring from the user's inner self and those that are imposed on the user by others.
[nisbot.icon]
 > How to read tasks in a task management tool is a difficult question.
 What would you like to see happen with respect to this "task"?
[Nishio.icon]We tend to think it's about doing things, but that's a false KPI, and we should maximize the gain per unit of time, not the amount of things we do.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "task" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice if it could be verbalized what is gained by doing that task.
[nisbot.icon] With regard to the "task", can it be done?
[nishio.icon]Should we have a system to ask those questions?
[nisbot.icon]
 > It would be nice if it could be verbalized what is gained by doing that task.
 What does this "task" look like?
[nishio.icon]It's like taking one step forward. To do too many steps without knowing the direction you want to go or the place you want to reach is like running around without knowing where you are going.
[nisbot.icon]
 > This needs to be chewed over more. The case where you say something like, "I feel like I should study English, but I'm not motivated to do it," is not the right definition of the task. It is unclear what would be good about doing the task.
 What do you hope will happen regarding this "motivation"?
[nishio.icon]When you get motivated, you go fast, like riding a bike instead of walking. So, if you get motivated for a task that is not appropriate, you will just get lost on the bike. I guess I need to clarify my destination setting.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to "motivation" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]You should be motivated for appropriate tasks. So, conversely, we should not be motivated for inappropriate tasks.
[nisbot.icon]As for "motivation", can it?
[nishio.icon]You need to have a system that divides tasks into suitable and unsuitable tasks according to the question, and then motivate the appropriate tasks.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that "motivation" and the "task"?
[nishio.icon]Tasks are digested when you are motivated, and you are motivated when you have the right task in front of you.
[nisbot.icon]Is that "motivation" the same as "task"? Are they different?
[nishio.icon]No, sir.
[nisbot.icon]
 > When you are motivated, tasks get digested, and when you have the right tasks in front of you, you are motivated.
 What happens to your "motivation" during this "task"?
[nishio.icon]A good cycle goes around: you get motivated to do a task, you get rewarded for doing it, and you get even more motivated.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the "task" when its "motivated"?
[nishio.icon]Again
This mode supports proposals to make [nisbot.icon]. What are you thinking of making?
[nishio.icon]A system that asks in-depth questions about tasks, clarifies what can be gained from the task, and then subdivides it to the point where the goal is visible to motivate the user.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of person is that for?
[nishio.icon]People who are unmotivated due to lack of task organization.
[nisbot.icon]What would that person like to see happen?
[nishio.icon]I hope the cluttered task list is organized, you know what to do now, you're motivated to do it, and the gain is maximized.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]I hope this chat system will have a specialized mode for organizing tasks.
[nisbot.icon]How can I do that?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice to have a language of what questions to ask for that specialized mode.
[nisbot.icon]What made you think that way?
[nishio.icon]I tried to create three specialized modes, but it is necessary to create questions first. The first question proposal is fine if it's messy, because as you make and try it out, you will come up with more and more ideas for improvement.
[nisbot.icon]
 > It would be nice if this chat system could have a specialized mode for organizing tasks.
 What is the connection between this "task" and "motivation"?
You could have a [nishio.icon] system and convert tasks into motivation.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that "system" and "task"?
