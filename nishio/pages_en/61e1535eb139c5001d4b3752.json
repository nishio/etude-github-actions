Just the right [metaphor example] to explain the terms [experience process and meaning creation].
　The process of trying to somehow describe "this feeling" and coming up with the combination of symbols of "love like a Polaroid" is [COMPREHENSION].
　When I saw the expression "love like a Polaroid," I thought, "What are they talking about?" and you think, "Is this what he is trying to say?" and you come up with something. This process is called [METAPHOR].
 For a supplementary explanation, "In this sense, it's love like a Polaroid," [CIRCUMLOCUTION].
 Clarification of the meaning by [RELEVANCE] that makes you say "I see, that's what it means" when you see the supplementary explanation
