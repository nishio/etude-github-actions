Filtering Elements
	The process of removing elements of indefinite length that are included in a specific blacklist
		code:python
		 for x in xs:
		 	if x in BLACKLIST:
		 		continue
	This is equivalent to having a function f(x) with "element x â†’ 0/1" and calculating xf(x)

	Can be extended to functions that return real numbers between 0 and 1
		Inverse pattern of [Make real numbers between 0 and 1 {0, 1}].
		Describing only the blacklist in the code is equivalent to accumulating only negative examples.
		If we also accumulate positive examples, the `x in BLACKLIST` part will be replaced by a 2-class classification
