Rare resources are expensive, but whether they are productive depends on how they are used.
Market-traded [resources] are overpriced when supply is short relative to demand, but whether that is [productive] depends on how the resource is used.
　In other words, if used improperly, the phenomenon of "expensive but useless" will occur.
　　Often observed that the user blames the resource, but in some cases the user is at fault or simply a mismatch

>[kis https://twitter.com/kis/status/1393217241630400515]: If I were to do freelance work, I would probably charge 1.5 million yen per month at the lowest, but I can't write code in a month that someone making 500,000 yen per month can write in a month. I can't write the code in a month that a 500,000 yen/month guy can write in a month. Instead, I can write code in a month that a 500,000 yen/month person cannot write in a year.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393224501282762753]: half of this is correct, the other half is that talking about the amount first is not good for reasons such as "the amount depends on the situation" or "it makes people aware of the pecking order and creates an emotional backlash". I think this is not a good idea for a number of reasons. There are type A jobs and type B jobs in the world, and there are people who are good at A and people who are good at B. There are few people who are good at B, so they get a high price in the market. twitter.com/kis/status/139...

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393225751801958400]: If you hire someone who is good at type B in a place that only does type A work, they won't produce twice as much as someone who is good at type A. So they'll say, "It's expensive. It's a rip-off. The other side thinks, "Of course they're not productive, they're Type B people, they're just doing Type A work.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393226906657427464]: The original story was about the unit price of programmers, but "hiring an MBA holder but he is useless" and "hiring a Tokyo University student but he is useless" have the same composition. The same story applies to "I hired an MBA but he's useless" or "I hired a Tokyo University student but he's useless".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393232109322395651]: Conversely, if you try to get a Type A person to do a Type B job, what happens is that, assuming no difference in intelligence or enthusiasm, the Type B person If we assume that there is no difference in intelligence and enthusiasm, then we need to spend the same amount of time on knowledge acquisition as the Type B person has spent on knowledge acquisition so far. Whether that is six months or three years depends on the nature of the knowledge. And it is difficult to estimate before acquisition.
　[5 minutes not 5 minutes + 54 years].
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1393233984956428290]: well, this is a case where the difference between type A and type B is a difference in knowledge, and knowledge acquisition can change from A to B. There are many cases where this is valid but it is not generally valid.

We tend to talk implicitly about the difference in knowledge, but for example, if there are two types of people, A, who want to leave the office at 5:00 p.m. because of family reasons and B, who can stay until 10:00 p.m. because they are single and have nothing to do at home, and if the supply of Type B is very low, companies that want to hire Type B people have to pay them a lot. In reality, they are not that rare, so the fixed salary is just not that high. In this case, a Type A person would have to sacrifice their family in order to switch to Type B.
　In this case, a Type B person has the option of working overtime to earn overtime pay.
　Some companies take away that option by forcing people to leave work on time, and in those places, Type B people can't take advantage of their characteristics.
