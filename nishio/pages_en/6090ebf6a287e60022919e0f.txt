 *1206577791*Contribute to yasnippet
 Yesterday, I gave some feedback on the snippet I wrote for EmacsLisp's reference grinding, and it has been corrected and will be included in the next release.
 
 Correction Points
 - Using mapconcat
 - (current-column) to see the current indentation.
 
 Study.

 I mean, if you read the yasnippet page carefully, there are several references to CodeRepos.

 Isn't it awful?

 I don't want to search for nishiohirokazu and come up in 3rd place or something.
 
 *1206603898*make yasnippets work in actionscript-mode too
 Ugh, the snippet I put in the python-mode directory is triggered, but the one in the actionscript-mode directory is not. Why is that?
 
 -----
 
 I don't see yas/expand being called when I press TAB. Why doesn't actionscript-mode work? Why doesn't actionscript-mode work?

 The actionscript-mode is
 (setq actionscript-mode-map (c-make-inherited-keymap))
 I was initializing it in the
 The python-mode is
 (setq py-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
 Initialized with
 
 I tried changing the initialization of actionscript-mode for the sake of it, but it doesn't work.

 I have yas/minor-mode in minor-mode.

 Noticed.

 Minor-mode is turned off.

 Very suspicious. I'll try commenting it out. (ActionScript hs) is replaced by (ActionScript) and yas is still nil.

 Forcing yas to read hs in a way that was not obviously the correct solution but was forcing hs to read yas.

 Oh, yay, I got yas working, I don't know what hs does but I uncommented it out.

 I got it to work as a coping mechanism for now, but it's weird to work on major-mode and then minor-mode. How is the right way to do it?

 It's empty. Surprising.
 
 *1206633764*Py went to a yakiniku
 I was told that how writing org still uses SQLite and that it will be lighter if I use MySQL and mod_fcgi.
 
 TODO: Break into id:voluntas' company and play with Erlang on a 128-core machine.
 
 The reason why Erlang didn't seem interesting to me is because it is a very rich language with only one core, which is useless for poor people. If I had 128 cores, I would use Erlang.
 
 I also heard that if you use ActionScript, knowing Progression and not knowing Progression makes a lot of difference. I'll look into it later. http://progression.libspark.org/
 
 Also, search prezivon's blog in Silverlight.
 
 Oh, that's right. I was going to install Ubuntu on the lab machine, and rumor has it that even if Windows is already installed, it will install just like installing a regular program, without the need to repartition it.
