After the age of twenty, you are just a man
	There is an old saying, "A child prodigy at ten, a gifted child at fifteen, and a mere man after twenty.
	It is a common phenomenon that a person who is praised as "great" when young becomes mediocre when he or she grows up.
		I myself have known many similar cases, so it is a common concept for adults.
		I wouldn't be particularly surprised if the child prodigy was mediocre at age 20.
		However, the 10-year-old himself has no experience of observing for himself what the passage of 10 years from "10 years old to 20 years old" brings about.
	The status of "prodigy" is a short-term bonus.
	Adults around you lose interest rather quickly.
		Most adults don't care about the lives of individual prodigies, they just consume them as topical content.
	If we don't take advantage of short-term bonuses to create a larger "difference" from the average person, we will become mediocre.
