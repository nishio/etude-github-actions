bilinear
defined by the vector space V on the coefficient body F [bilinear form] B: V × V → F is
 [$ B(u + v, w) = B(u, w) + B(v, w)]
 [$ B(u, v + w) = B(u, v) + B(u, w)]
 [$ B(\lambda u, v) = B(u, \lambda v) = \lambda B(u, v)]
Satisfy the following.

As a concrete example, consider the inner product [$ B(u, v) = u \cdot v], which satisfies the above conditions.
