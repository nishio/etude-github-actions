word-hunting
A "Word hunting is not good, don't use the word "word hunting!"
B "Isn't that word hunting?"

[boomerang joke]

This isn't very refreshing.
　There's a confusion between "the act referred to by the term 'word-hunting'" and "the term 'word-hunting.'"
　"The practice called word-hunting is not good" and "the use of the word 'word-hunting' is not good" are two different claims, and you have to conflate and equate them to make the boomerang work.
