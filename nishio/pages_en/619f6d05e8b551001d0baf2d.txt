Communication without call-outs
>[ShogoNu https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1463539988390318085]: I was shocked to see my own kids, they leave the voice call on, and when they want to talk, they suddenly start a conversation, and when they don't When they don't, they just stay connected and don't talk. They communicate with each other as if they are in the same space, even though they are far away from each other. It's crazy! I thought I was being left behind.

>[ShogoNu https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1463540870301421577]: It's amazing to see the disconnect between our generation and the digital native generation who, in the early days of the Internet, would call their friends and loved ones' houses to connect, and when they called, the parents on the other end of the line would answer. I think there is a huge disconnect between our generation and the digital native generation. Physical communication is always connected. Wait, don't leave me!

I told them that we should make a voice version of "slack", where you don't have to call someone's name, connect instantly, talk instantly, and disconnect after a period of silence.

>I'm wondering if you are using a discord work server? I use a microphone to collect all the audio in my room from the time I wake up in the morning until I go to bed (or even when I'm sleeping) and share it with my friends, like virtual cohabitation. I recommend it because you won't feel lonely.

>[ShogoNu https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1463545959325995014]: Yes, that's how people use discord. I think middle-aged people don't like to hear the sounds of daily life. Also, because it breaks their concentration. But the generation that's used to it is multitasking. So I think, "I don't want to be left behind.

>[ShogoNu https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1463546980160794632]: This generation of physical, always-connected communication is truly the generation of the metaverse. Physical and digital are connected to each other. Young people are running at supersonic speed while old men are saying "I hate being in VR all the time.

>[ShogoNu https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1463547564322525185]: I believe it is the generation of users who will be the center of the Metaverse that has no sense of ON and OFF!

>[FeelzenVr https://twitter.com/FeelzenVr/status/1463549449221783556]: oh I see..!
>I am not sure which age group is indicated by "middle-aged," but at least we have people in their early 20s to late 40s resident in our mackerel, so I guess it is a neighborhood rather than an age group. I think it's more like a neighborhood. But it is true that there are many freelancers and self-employed people stationed at Saba now, so maybe they are good at multitasking to begin with.

>[ShogoNu https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1463550075473334273]: I certainly agree that it's not the generation but the neighborhood that is familiar or not...

>[ShogoNu https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1463552999385559041]: Even with e-mail and faxes, there used to be a greeting like "Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to you on XXXX", but with the advent of messenger and LINE, people started chatting without greeting. But with the advent of messenger and LINE, we can now chat without greetings, right? Likewise, if you have AirPods in your phone, no matter where you are on the planet, you can say, "Hey, Numakura, about that thing you were talking about earlier," and you can make a quick call just like in Ghost in the Shell.

>[ShogoNu https://twitter.com/ShogoNu/status/1463553802103967744]: My hunch is that mankind will get used to this no greeting call and sudden end of conversation.
