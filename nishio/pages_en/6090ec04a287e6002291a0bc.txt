 I glanced at it and couldn't find a way for the recipient to register with this service to tell me not to send it to them anymore, so I blocked and reported spamming the person who sent it to me anyway. Well, I thought that there is no harm in doing so, since I do not share the same values as the person who sends this kind of mail.
