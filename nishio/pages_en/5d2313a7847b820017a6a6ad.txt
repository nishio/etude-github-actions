PC version should have shortcut keys.
	It would be nice if Cmd+Enter could be used to send.
		One line of text is recommended, so rather press Enter to send, Shift+Enter to break line.
 Switching tools
 	Align shortcuts with Adobe products
  	P:Pen
  	T:Text(Add Piece)
  	Space: Hand(Move)
  	E:Erace
  	Q:Lasso
  	G:Group
  	C-Z: Undo
  	C-R: Redo
	[Cmd+0 for whole view].
	Cmd+1 to display full size
		Zeros and ones are fine.
