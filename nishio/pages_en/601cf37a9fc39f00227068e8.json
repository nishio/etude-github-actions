[working notes on motion extraction].
I assumed that the unjudged data was written in the file unknown.txt with one case per line in previous versions.
It was hard to use it, so I made it a generator.
code:python
 def get_unknowns():
     logs = open(_RAW_LOGS).readlines()
     for text in logs:
         for case in text_to_cases(text):
             yield case

The user's customization is now in user.py, and the default implementation is in default.py.
code:python
 from .user import (
     make_features, print_case, write, case_from_str, case_to_str, get_unknowns,
     MODEL_NAME, create_model, INITIAL_DOWN_SAMPLING
 )

"Where's the latest code?" so I pushed the current code for now.
