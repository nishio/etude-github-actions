The Trap of Extracted Writing
[https://gyazo.com/4032a0631ac160fbc1ee904c74ae94e0]

	Pitfalls when reading a book and [excerpting] or [highlighting].
	When you [output] what you [experience] as language, you don't have this pitfall.
	When you read a book and output it [the input] itself is already in the form of language.
	Instead of inputting it and thinking about it and outputting it in your own mind, you simply work on cutting out parts of the input.
	You feel like you're doing something useful, but you're actually [stopping] thinking.
	I think it's cooler to have a sentence cut out of a book than a sentence spun out of my own thoughts, and I think that's a good thing.
	I don't think hard, I just kind of marker off sentences that have a cool vibe with the words and feel like I've accomplished something.
	It's just a [degraded copy].
	If you don't train yourself [to weave sentences], you will always only be able to make degraded copies of other people's content.
