Blaming the run is agrarian bias.
>"A long time ago, when I quit my job to study in [Mongolia], I was told, "Isn't that [running away]?" I was told. I was at a loss for an answer. But in Mongolia, I learned that in the [nomadic] culture, "running away" is not a [shameful] thing to do. They go forward when they can win, and run away when they are in trouble. To win tomorrow. Maybe it's [agrarian bias] that blames them for "running away." Because there is land to protect.

Certainly the idea that "when an enemy attacks and you are suffering, it is good to stay and fight to the death until the end, not to run away," is convenient for the sake of the government when land is more important than people.
