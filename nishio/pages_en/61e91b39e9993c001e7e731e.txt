summarize information
	[collects thoughts].
		directly translated: [summarize] ideas
			I feel [incompatible] with the selection of the word "[ideas]"
			"information" fits
			"how to summarize information" and "how to make ideas" are similar patterns
			Time series:
				gather concrete information (= [information gathering]) 
				→ summarize them (= [pattern discovery] / [structure discovery]) 
				→ [make ideas]
