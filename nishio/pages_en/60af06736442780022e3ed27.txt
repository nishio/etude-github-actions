Register a link to do it later as a word
Old title: [make it a for now].
After much consideration, I decided to register `[PC] ` `[iPad] ` as a word.
　When I'm working on a solution, it's often a case of "I'll just write down the URL for now, and I'll make a proper page later," and the reason why I don't do it now is because I'm writing from my phone and I want to "organize it on the big screen of my PC" or "use my iPad to draw a diagram". I want to draw a diagram on my iPad.
　I also made it easy to type from a mobile phone, so it's in "and".

Scrapbox's "If you can't think of a title, you can change it later anyway, so just put in the date and time or whatever you want" has been taken to the extreme, resulting in a single letter "a.

One letter without aaa or anything extra.
　Stringing the same letters together is hard to do on a phone.

By keeping it all in one place, it's easier to find the ones I haven't titled.

　If the goal is to make it easier to find "things without titles," then registering words is one way to do that.
　Generally, when you just paste a URL like this, you get the phenomenon of "it sinks and becomes an inaccessible deposit because you didn't give the information immediately".

　　But the "untitled thing" connection digs me up.

Q: Why not do it right away in the first place?
　When I'm in a hurry, or when I'm working from my phone and want to work on my PC.
　Hmmm, if it's "do it on PC", it might be more versatile to add the tag "do it on PC" right away in the word register, instead of delaying only the task of "titling" in this way.
　If I say "I'll do it later on my PC" or "I'll do it later on my iPad," can I search for "later"?
　　Search could be a streak because of the hassle of avoiding false hits.
