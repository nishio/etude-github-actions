When 1 to x is sufficient and 1 to x-1 is not, x is required
Title needs improvement

For a predicate f that takes a set as an argument
	[$ f(S) = 0, f(S+\{x\}) = 1]
Then the thought pattern that x is required to be 1

What are the conditions for being able to say this?
ã€€[$ f(S) = 1 \Rightarrow \forall T \supset S, f(T) = 1] 

Instead of doing a [$ 2^N] search when [finding one subset that satisfies the condition], we only need N.
[2^N search not possible].
