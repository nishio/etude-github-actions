 *1245759753* How many times does a perfect shuffle go back to normal?
 I wanted to see it, so I made it. This is a pattern where the second half of the first one is the new first one

 I wanted to make the threads alternate like weaving, but then the vertical relationship of the threads would not be sequential, so I would have to chop the lines I am currently drawing in one pass into small pieces and make them alternate properly. That would be a bit of a challenge.

 There is still room for improvement in line thickness and horizontal movement with each shuffle.

 At any rate, I briefly reviewed it before doing it with matrices. Next, we will make a version that uses matrices.

 Hmmm, OK, now you should be able to do a lot of things.
