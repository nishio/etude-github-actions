`[11:29:23] [Server thread/WARN]: You specified a resource pack without providing a sha1 hash. Pack will be updated on the client only if you change the name of the pack.`
If you don't specify the sha1 hash, you won't be able to update it, and that's a problem.

$ sha1sum cybozu.zip

Huh?

Like this?
code::
 cybozu$ zip -r ../cybozu.zip .
   adding: assets/ (stored 0%)
   adding: assets/minecraft/ (stored 0%)
   adding: assets/minecraft/textures/ (stored 0%)
   adding: assets/minecraft/textures/block/ (stored 0%)
   adding: assets/minecraft/textures/block/yellow_glazed_terracotta.png (deflated 5%)
   adding: pack.mcmeta (deflated 16%)

It downloads correctly, but the picture hasn't changed.
Oh, okay, I get it, you want to change the `minecraft:` in this to `cybozu:`.
ã€€Note: The description here may not be correct, I will check and correct it later.
code::
 {
   "variants": {
     "facing=east": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta",
       "y": 270
     },
	...
 }
It's done, it's done, it's done.
