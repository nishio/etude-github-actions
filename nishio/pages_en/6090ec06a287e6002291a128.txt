 *1292637652* How many yen per second could be lost in packet charges?
 I thought I did not know whether the packet charge is 10 yen per second, 100 yen per second, or about 10 yen per minute, so I did some calculations. However, the fee structure is complicated and I don't want to calculate it seriously, so I just did a random calculation, hoping that I didn't get one digit wrong...

 At 128 bytes per packet, the price per packet varies surprisingly from plan to plan, ranging from 0.21 yen to 0.01575 yen. I've never even heard of the cheaper plan, so if I didn't think about it, I'd probably end up with the most expensive one, but I'll take a pause and calculate it at 0.1 yen.
 
 Since it says maximum downlink speed is 7.2 Mbps, 7.2 * 1024 * 1024 / 8 is 943718 bytes per second.
 
 What a surprise. That was about an order of magnitude more than I had imagined! Scary!
