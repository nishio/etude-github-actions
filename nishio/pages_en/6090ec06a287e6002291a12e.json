 *1293983664*Diary of an abstract game with a 6 year old.
 I played Aquarius (SEE: <a href='http://sgrk.blog53.fc2.com/blog-entry-1465.html'>Koenji 0-minute Sugorokuya Game: Aquarius</a>) with my cousin's son (6 years old).
 
 Last New Year, I showed him <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%BF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA %E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9'>Tantrix</a> and played with it a little. I showed him a little play and he said, "You put them so that the colors are connected?" I thought he would understand the basic connection rules of Aquarius, but he understood much faster than I expected.
 
 Aquarius itself is a game that I took to a certain high IQ group and they scoffed at me, saying it was "boring" and "why did you buy this? The reason why I bought it was because it said "with rules for playing with children under 6 years old".
 
 But I ended up improvising without reading those six-year-old rules. First of all, to explain the rules of how to connect, you put everything in a table and look for a card that is convenient for the explanation, right? Then, when I showed him how to connect the cards, he picked up the card to do the same, right? There is no way you would take it away and turn it face down to make a deck. So, I tried to connect the cards as I saw fit, using the rule that you can choose any card you like from the face-up cards.
 
 The rulebook I just checked has victory conditions, number of cards in hand, etc., but if it's me and a 6 year old playing against each other anyway, I'm the obvious winner, so I guess there's no need for rules to determine who wins and who loses. Maybe it would be better to introduce a cooperative game instead of a competitive game.
 
 - The simplest rule
 -- Remove all action cards
 -- Put them all in a table and line them all up with the correct connections. If they are all lined up, it's a joint win.
 -- Praise them when they line up with the correct connections. If multiple connections occur, there is no bonus in the game rules, but give a bonus for mentioning and praising.
 
 Well, so after all the cards are laid out, his father comes in and the three of us play. Okay, let's introduce the win condition.
 
 - simple competitive sports rules
 -- Action cards remain removed
 -- Shuffle the gold cards and pull them together. Public.
 -- Whoever makes their color last the longest wins. Play until you run out of cards.
 
 Seven to a game is not enough. There is too little time to control the game. That's why I made it a rule to play until all the cards are used up. The reason why the goal is open to the public is because it is obvious that 6 year olds only think about extending their own color, and if that is the case, it is more equal for adults to be open to the public.
 
 I found out later that I needed to explicitly mention "you may (or may not) place a card that does not contain your color". An interpretation quandary occurred.
 
 Two plays and more "I'll do it again!" but paused because it was now tea time. I looked at the action cards I had put away at that point and asked, "What do you use these for?" I told him, "They are used for difficult rules. After teatime, "I'll do it for hard rules!" I was told... I even think that action cards should be removed even when adults play in the first place... So I said, "Well, let's play by the hard rules," and decided to ignore the action cards and introduce deck & hand cards.
 
 - hard-to-fight rules
 -- 5 cards in hand
 -- Put one card from the hand.
 -- You get a card with the number of species you have connected.
 
 I refactored the original rules, because it's not right to take one card, put it down, and get a bonus of n - 1 cards if you connect 2 or more (n) different cards.
 
 The introduction of the hand made it impossible to observe the situation in which the 6-year-old was placed, but he was able to extend his colors without difficulty. Well, after three plays, he could do it. Toward the end of the game, the child came out and said, "I don't have a flame (my color) anymore. His grandmother and father told him what his color was, and that they wanted him to put it down, but he responded in no time to my negotiation, "If you put water (my color) here, I'll put down a flame on my next turn. You know what you're getting into! Well, I guess I'm still not good enough in that area, because he didn't get any complaints that I betrayed him and didn't place the flame on the third turn after negotiating with him twice. It seems that they can determine on the spot that it is to their benefit to enter into a negotiation, but they don't check to see if it was properly fulfilled the next turn. I guess they don't remember until the next turn.
 
 Then, when the water was gone and it was 12 cards for the 6-year-old and 10 cards for his grandmother, the grandmother of 10 said, "I want you to put down sky (grandmother's color)," and I put it down, so I thought, "Oh, he doesn't know the winner? When his father or I shook our hands and said, "I want to leave the sky empty," he said, "No." I could see the winners and losers, but I could not see the losers. He could tell when he was winning or losing, but he couldn't read that his moves, which didn't lead directly to victory or defeat, could lead to defeat if they were combined with actions taken by third parties against him. After all, he had learned from watching other players and was playing a passive-aggressive strategy of "putting the opponent's color in a different place from the longest row of the opponent's hand".
 
 Ah, yes, I observed the behavior of trying to connect them when one's color is in two different places, but they don't seem to understand "It takes so many moves to connect them and it can't be accomplished if someone else interferes," "The card I am trying to connect is also needed by another player, and the opponent has the first move. or "The card I am trying to connect is also needed by another player, and the opponent is ahead of me". Also, I was very nervous when I couldn't get him to "go for it from the long side, considering the possibility of failure to connect". I was so scared that he would extend the short side even though it didn't look like it would connect.
 
 I suggested to him that I would destroy the last breathing point, but he immediately understood that it would be fatal and said, "No." In his next move, he prolonged the life of a card with one color on the breathing point. I said, "No!
 
 It was an interesting game, for example. I think we gained a lot of knowledge about children's cognition and the design of abstract games for children.
