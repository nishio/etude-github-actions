The Parable of the Applause
	clash with one's right hand and left hand
  There's a snapping sound.
  Was the sound made by the right hand? Was the sound made by the left hand?

	For example, Mr. A gave instructions to Mr. B, but Mr. B misunderstood them and they were not handled correctly.
  Is it Mr. A's fault or Mr. B's fault?



#Parable
Which hand made the sound when both hands were struck?
