ChatGPT is a smart ass.
[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1636412574672781315]: I was disappointed that my friend didn't get it when I said "ChatGPT is [a smart ass]", but I'm relieved to know that at least Dr. Rekimoto will get it. I was relieved to know that at least Dr. Rekimoto would get it.

[ChatGPT] is [smart][stupid].

　I was talking to ChatGPT4 and I was thinking that it looks like something... deja vu... I'm starting to get the feeling that there are guys like this out there.
　With this kind of guy.
　　He's quick-witted and babbles words at high speed.
　　I know a lot of terms and scatter them as appropriate.
　　When you talk like that verbally, most people can't follow you, so they feel "huh, a smart person is talking about something difficult that I don't understand".
　　　So I'm sure this behavior is reinforced by the benefits of usually doing that kind of activity.
　　But if you read the recorded statements carefully and in writing, they don't say much.
　　　It's just a bunch of random words you came up with.
　　　　Well, that's how LLM works, so that's how it is, I guess.
　　The stories are connected topically, but there's no big picture as a whole.
　　　I feel like I'm just embellishing a poor assumption with clever vocabulary because I don't know what I'm talking about.

I was transcribing and summarizing the above on 2023-03-18 and a picture came to mind.

	1 people have a hard time putting what they want to say into words, and even when they do their best to verbalize it, the story can be twisted.
	Compared to that person, a person who can tell a straight story is perceived as "smart.
	　[water on a standing board]
	If we consider this axis as "smart", GPT4 would be "smart".
	However, when I actually talked to GPT4, my feeling was the opposite: "This guy is an idiot acting like he's smart.
	What gave rise to this sensation?
