An old man who says the same thing over and over again.
I think that the "Mere Old Man" who says the same thing over and over again means that he cannot judge whether he has already said what he is going to say or not. If we write everything we want to say in Scrapbox and search for it in Scrapbox when we have something to say, we can "judge whether we have already said it or not" without any problem even if the function of the person's [real brain] deteriorates.

In other words, let's use Scrapbox to avoid becoming "an old man saying the same thing over and over again!
ã€€(Not limited to Scrapbox)
 Seriously, record it in a [searchable] way, I guess.
