 *1359000715*My Pomodoro Algorithm
 I tried to verbalize how I do it, because clearly verbalizing is the first step to improvement.
 
 By the way, in my notation, □ is a check box to write at the beginning of the task and ◯ is a pomodoro for 25 minutes. As for the equipment, "iPhone default timer counts down 25 minutes" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B003COV2X0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=B003COV2X0&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Fusen (38mm x 50mm)</a>" "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/ product/B000MWW6NA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B000MWW6NA&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Silencing headphones</a>" and "a playlist of 22 minutes of songs that might increase concentration + 4 minutes of relaxing music.

 Preparation: 1.
 　Running in no particular order {
 　　Start the timer for 25 minutes
 　　□Choose one from the TODO list and write on a sticky note the goal that you think you can achieve in 25 minutes, and write a ◯ on the mark where you estimate that this task is 1 pomodoro.
 　　□(Optional) Put on headphones and play a 25-minute playlist.
 　}
 
 // Exception handler registration
 goto interrupt if there is an interrupt
 When the timer rings goto Timer
 goto Goal achieved when the scheduled goal is achieved.
 
 Task Execution: 1.
 　□Work in a concentrated manner
 
 Interrupts:.
 　if(can that be processed after this pomodoro is done?) {
 　　□Write on sticky note
 　　goto Execute task // Back to work
 　}else{
 　　Process interrupts
 　　if(Interrupt work is short and you can get back to your task easily?) {
 　　　goto Execute task // Back to work
 　　}else{
 　　　□ Remove "◯" with a cross in the sense that the time box was not completed.
 　　　□ Stop timer
 　　　goto Prepare // Next task
 　　}
 　}
 
 Goal achieved
 　Congratulations! You've completed your task ahead of schedule!
 　Strike through to mark a task completed.
 　if(time remaining is less than 10 minutes){
 　　□To write down the knowledge gained in the process of work, or to put away the fusen,
 　　　Send an email to the client that the work has been completed, git push, or do other small tasks related to the task.
 　}else{
 　　□ Remove "◯" with a cross in the sense that the time box was not completed.
 　　□ Stop timer
 　　goto Prepare // Next task
 　}
 
 Timer rings:.
 　Congratulations, you've worked intensely for 25 minutes!
 　□Draw a diagonal line through the ◯ to indicate that you have concentrated for 25 minutes.
 　if(task also just finished){
 　　Congrats, you're a great guy! Your estimate is perfect!
 　　goto Prepare // Next task
 　}else if(I think it will take less than 10 minutes to make the cut){
 　　Start the timer (to measure how long it actually took)
 　　// Exception handler registration
 　　When the timer rings goto Timer 2nd time
 　　I'm going to do it as far as I can.
 　　goto Prepare // Next task
 　}else{
 　　I gained knowledge by doing 1 pomodoro. I would have been able to make better estimates.
 　　goto Re-quote
 　}
 
 Timer 2nd:
 　Congratulations, you've worked intensely for 25 minutes!
 　□Draw a diagonal line through the ◯ to indicate that you have concentrated for 25 minutes.
 　Unfortunately, the estimates don't seem to be very accurate. Are you stuck in the doldrums?
 　Go to make tea, go to the restroom, take a walk, etc. to get back on track.
 　goto Re-quote
 
 Re-quote:.
 　□Re-estimate the time required for the remaining tasks.
 　　That task proved to be more time-costly than expected.
 　　Should I do that task now? Is it right to do it that way? It is necessary to take a step back and consider including the following questions.
 　goto Preparation

 I learned the idea that estimates are to be updated from here.
