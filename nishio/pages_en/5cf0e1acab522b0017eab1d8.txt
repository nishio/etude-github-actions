Reply All is required for emails with CC
[https://gyazo.com/1b3a21d571b1cb0cfcfe81c3fe8969ec]
	Assume that when Mr. A sends an email to Mr. B, it is cc'd to Mr. C.
	When Mr. B replies to Mr. A, he needs to Reply All ([Reply All])
	Otherwise the reply will be sent only to Mr. A.
		Mr. A thinks "Mr. B responded back".
			Often assume that "Mr. C has received a reply as well".
		Mr. C thinks, "I haven't heard back from Mr. B yet."
			There's no way to know the email is being returned until you check with Mr. A.
	This situation occurs because of the design of the email tool.
		Not generated if you use a mailing list or group chat.
		[No-Email Workstyle]
