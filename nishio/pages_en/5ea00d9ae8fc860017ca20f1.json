Sticky note enlargement feature more useful than expected
2020-04-21
	The [make stickies larger] function was more beneficial than I expected.
	I only added the ability to double the size, but that was enough.
	First, collect stickies that seem relevant.
	→If there is an important sticky that represents those stickies among them, it will be enlarged.
		When you [zoom out], the sticky will be more visible.
		Smaller sticky notes placed around that sticky note hold a connection of meaning that cannot be expressed by a single sticky note.
	A "large sticky note and its cronies" can be created as a preliminary step to creating a "group with clear boundaries."
	When you want to "move together" that "loose cohesion".
		If it's just one time, lasso it around and move it as is,
		If you think you might want to move them as a group in the future, lasso them and then "make group" before moving them.
			→ "clearly delineated groups" after the fact.
	Close group" at the point when you feel you "don't need to see the cronies anymore and want to reduce the amount of information" by rearranging or reorganizing "loose groups" or "groups with clear boundaries.
		It is refreshing to see the cronies disappear only from the screen, without losing any information about them.
