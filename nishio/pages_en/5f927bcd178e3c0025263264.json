　Thoughts.
　　The simple way to do it is to repeat "take the smallest adjacent vertex".
　　But this way, when you have an edge from vertex 1 to 10^5 other edges, you'll have to choose from 10^5 edges about 10^5 times, so you won't make it in time.
　　So we need a way to get the minimum value without searching and sorting every time.
