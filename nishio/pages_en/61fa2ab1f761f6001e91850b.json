Parable of the Black Hole
When there is a certain "force that puts you in a bad state," and the closer you get to a bad state, the stronger that force becomes, once you cross a certain boundary, you can no longer [get out].

It's like when you get inside the event horizon of a [black hole], even light can't get out.

What fell into the black hole can no longer be taken out. [It is too late. Any effort to retrieve it will be futile, and the effort must be abandoned.
