Work Excitement through Ritual
	There are big [tasks] that require a lot of mental energy to take on.
	Have a "[ritual]" to do before you do this.
		Individually, this ritual is small and simple.
		For example.
			put on earplugs
			Stack muffled headphones on top of each other.
			Keep a carton of tea within easy reach.
			Take out your smartphone, launch the timer app, and with one more tap, the 25-minute timer is ready to start.
	[Work excitement] comes from doing the work of ritual.
		By doing this series of rituals, I push myself into [the zone].
