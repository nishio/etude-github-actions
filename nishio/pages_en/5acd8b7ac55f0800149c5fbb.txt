begin roughly
	I don't have time, I already have too many projects, someone is more qualified than me, etc.
 Those are not reasons not to start.
	Even if you can't turn 0 into 1, you should first turn it into 0.1
 And sharing that information, signaling
 When someone comes along who can give an effort of about 0.2, the choice is to pile on top of that 0.1 or to turn the 0 into a 0.2.
	The benefit is greater when stacking on top of 0.1, so that is the choice.
 Cases that don't work
  If you have to understand and follow the rules set by your predecessor in order to build on top of 0.1, it's a hassle, so you want to create a new one.
  Signaling intensity is low and not getting through to the right people.
  I thought I set it to 0.1, but it's -0.1.
