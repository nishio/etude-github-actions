The summit is narrow.
	>The closer you get to the top of any world, the smaller the world becomes. As you seek out equals in the world who can inspire you, you will only be able to work with those who are aligned with you in the direction of greatness. The more you master the path, the more it becomes pure and becomes a stew. Instead of feeling like you are incredibly talented, you become lonely, except for a few comrades who can appreciate each other.

		[There is more than one summit.

　I painted the picture of the pyramidal mental model on the left by saying that the mental model of [a few smart people and many dumb people] is wrong.
　The expression "[there is] more than one summit" made me think of the diagram on the right.
