Allegory and Symbolism
> Later, Goethe explains the difference between himself and Schiller in terms of the relationship between "allegory" and "symbol" as follows. There is a great difference between a poet who seeks the particular for the universal, as [Schiller] does, and one who sees the universal in the particular, as [Goethe] does. From the former approach arises [allegory], in which the particular becomes a mere instance or example of the universal. The latter, on the other hand, is truly the essence of literature (Poesie), and it expresses a [particular] without recalling or directing the universal. Now, he who vividly perceives this particular, without realizing it or only later, has at the same time acquired the [universal]."(MR27) It is clear that the latter is what is called by Goethe "[the symbolic]"

[There are two approaches, one is to use [abstract concepts] to explain something and then use [concrete examples] as examples, and the other is to focus on vividly depicting concrete [mental images] away from abstract concepts and then [after the fact] "acquire universality" by [experiencing] it [after the fact]. There is an approach that "acquires universality" [after the fact] by focusing on vividly depicting concrete [mental images] away from abstract concepts and [experiencing] them
　I know some of you may not be familiar with the phrase, "winning the universal."
　When you have a new experience Y, you realize, "Oh, this is similar to an experience X that I had before," and [analogy] produces knowledge that can be applied to experience Y, you know a posteriori that you "had universal knowledge that crosses experience X and experience Y".
　　Whether this universal knowledge is verbalized or not is immaterial.

I've painted a few pictures related to [rootless knowledge], but maybe it's not a good idea to paint abstract concepts in the same circle as concrete experiences. Universal knowledge = abstract concepts are not always clearly verbalized at the time of application to new experiences.
