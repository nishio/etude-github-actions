The model is a reality emulator
	[Model] is [emulator] of reality
	Instead of experimenting in reality, we can experiment with models
	Lower cost than experiments in reality
	If the model successfully mimics reality, then the results of experiments using the model are the same as the results of reality
	Model is wrong and sometimes returns incorrect results
