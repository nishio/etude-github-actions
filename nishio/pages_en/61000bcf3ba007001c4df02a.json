	[Hermann Hesse]
		>Hermann Hesse [Hermann Hesse] (1877-1962)
  > ... At the age of 14, he passed a difficult exam and entered a seminary, but dropped out after less than a year. The gimnasium he entered after that, too, he soon dropped out... During World War I, he lived in Switzerland, but due to the effects of the war and family misfortunes, he suffered from a nervous disorder and was treated by a psychiatrist. This was a turning point for him, and his criticism of Western civilization and devotion to Eastern thought became apparent in his works. During the Nazi regime, he was banned from publishing his books in Germany as an "undesirable" writer. After World War II, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. He died in Switzerland in 1962.

	>Because of his "Under the Wheel" and other works, Hesse has the image of a writer of sweet and sour coming-of-age stories. He is also often seen as someone who writes pure, pastoral poems celebrating the nature of Switzerland. In reality, however, Hermann Hesse is neither idyllic nor sweet. He was by no means a harmless and meek man. As his later works, such as "Demian," "[Wolf of the Wilderness]," and "The Glass Bead Play," make clear, he was an [anti-authoritarian] man, a man with an uncompromisingly harsh and strong spirit and the ability to survive in reality while remaining true to himself. ... Haruhiko Shiratori, the author of the million-selling "Super-Translation of Nietzsche's Words," has carefully selected 230 words from Hesse's novels, poems, essays, letters, and other writings. Contents I [Follow your own path] II [Rejoice in your troubles and sorrows] III [Live selfishly] IV [One cannot live without joy] V [Add more love to this world] VI [Stop thinking] VII [You can be happy anywhere and anytime].
