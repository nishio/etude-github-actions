Vector was originally an astronomical term
 A New and Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences of 1764 explains vector as "an astronomical term, a line connecting a planet with its center (or elliptical focus).

 It says the origin of the name is because the planets appear to be CARRYING by the line.
  (vector is the Latin word for bearer.
 		>From Latin vector (“carrier, transporter”), from vehō (“I carry, I transport, I bear”).

 It was used in the idiomatic form "radius vector."
 It is clear that the word vector had an extremely narrow meaning during this period.
 At what point was a VECTOR created that was not a RADIUS VECTOR?
	The idiom Radius Vector appears in the 1816 Encyclopaedia Perthensis, but there is no occurrence of vector by itself
	It is also used in the idiomatic form radius vector in a book on Newtonian mechanics written in 1855.

  Moreover, this radius vector r is not a vector as we know it today, but a scalar value representing the length of the diameter


 1687 Newton's Principia Mathematica
 1835 Hamilton, create a definition of a complex number that does not use the square root of a negative number, which can represent a two-dimensional location
 Hamilton, trying to create a number that can represent a 3-dimensional location, but it doesn't work.
 >Hamilton knew that complex numbers could be interpreted as points in the coordinate plane, and he was looking for a way to do the same for points in three-dimensional space. Points in space can be represented by triples of numbers as their coordinates, and Hamilton had long known how to add and subtract from those triples, but he had long been stuck on the problem of how to define multiplication and division.

 1843 Hamilton generalizes complex numbers and defines quaternions, calling the imaginary part by the term vector

			We now think of vectors as "values with direction and length".
   After this, I explained the unit source null vector, coefficient (now called scalar times), and so on, and I thought it was normal...

   It gets creepy when you say, "We'll define nonparallel vector divisors later."
   Define "the result of division of vectors that are parallel is a scalar."
   	This scalar is a real part (Real)
   Scalar plus vector is a quaternion.

			So at this point vectors were represented as "imaginary parts of quaternions" and were implicitly three-dimensional.

 1878 Clifford invents the concept of inner and outer products, showing that the equivalent of the product of quaternions can be defined for three pairs of numbers
 1881 Gibbs, in writing a textbook on electromagnetism, uses only the three pairs of numbers in the imaginary part (vector part) of the quaternions in isolation.

 1636 Affine transformations studied as a branch of geometry
 1857 Linear transformations including Cayley and affine transformations are represented by matrices
  In the same year, Glassman, in the course of his research, creates the concepts of linear independence, scalar times dimension, and
 1888 Peano gives a modern definition of vector space
  In this area, the vector is finally formulated, as we now call it.
