Do not be unapproachable.
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Do not be unapproachable.

They should not be unapproachable.

No one is so perfect that he does not need the advice of others at times. He is so incorrigible that he will not listen to anyone. Even the most distinguished intellect should find a place for friendly advice. We must learn to lean on sovereignty itself. There are those who are inaccessible and therefore unruly. They are doomed because no one will rescue them. The Most High should keep the door open for friendship. It may become a gate of help. A friend must be able to freely advise and condemn without embarrassment. Our satisfaction with him and our trust in his firm convictions will give him that strength. One need not give respect and credit to all, but in the deepest recesses of one's vigilance lies the true mirror of a good friend who must correct his errors and be grateful for them.
