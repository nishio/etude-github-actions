Offsetting Mean Regression
Suppose that some measure is applied to the top 10% of the distribution of grades. If the distribution is random, then [mean reversion] will cause a "drop in the performance of the target for which the measure was taken". How effective is the measure in preventing the decline? This can be expressed by a mathematical model.
