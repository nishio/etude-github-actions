Should there be only one name?

	Disagree with the statement to the effect that "one [name] is simpler."
	Name is a string of characters that can be the same as another person's name
	Insufficient functionality for personal identification when made into one.
	Personal identification should certainly use unique IDs that are different for each individual.
	I prefer to have one or more names to call myself whatever I want.
		Some people want to use stage names or pseudonyms...
	For example, in [Cybozu Live], you could choose what name to display for each group you belong to, even for the same account.
　　As a result, for example, the company, the PTA, and the coterie could use different names, but the accounts would be unified and multiple groups could be listed horizontally.
　　I could deal with cases such as, "I don't want my colleagues at work to know about my doujinshi activities, and I don't want my company e-mail address to be known to my fellow doujinshi.
		My memory wasn't wrong: [Cybozu Live adds new features including multi-profile registration https://cloud.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/384097.html]
	The [real name] is more information than necessary, and just disclosing the real name may disclose information such as gender, ancestry, and ethnic origin, for example.
	　Many people are reluctant to disclose those information to all.
	　I'm on Twitter under my real name and I don't care, but I think those who do care have the "freedom not to disclose".
	Well, if many people insist that there should be a single name, we would describe it as "[selective multiple names] and [compulsory single name]" just as we described it as "[selective separate married name] and [compulsory married name]".
