The Parable of the Sower
A parable of what happens to seeds that fall in various places.
　The seed that fell on good soil grew a hundredfold.
　[A seed that fell on stony ground sprouted quickly, but died because it had no roots.]
　　Nishio often uses the metaphor [rootless grass].

In [Plowing/Seedling/Growing], the reason why [Plowing Phase] is necessary is that seeds cannot grow if they fall on land that has not been plowed.
　Might it sprout?

[Matthew 13]
>3 ... The sower went out to sow his seed.
> 4While sowing, some seeds fell by the roadside and birds came and ate them.
> 5 Other seeds fell on a stony area with little soil, where the soil was shallow and sprouted quickly.
> 6But when the sun rose, it burned and died because it had no roots.
> 7Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and blocked them.
> 8But other seeds fell on good land and bore fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
