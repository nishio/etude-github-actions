Repair models with peeling textures
	I downloaded the TARDIS model but the texture is peeling off, I don't know how to put it on.

		Ability to change the material mapping of imported objects in Unity
  Now we can make the texture a new material and re-map it.
	I'm sure there are easier ways to do this.
 	[Brender] power needed
