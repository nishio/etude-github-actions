　I was going to buy a container for mosquito coils, but it came with it.
　　When you turn the lid of the can upside down, there is a fireproof fiber, and you can put incense directly on it.
　The scent of a Buddhist altar
　I left it on the balcony and it rained and the incense got wet, but after drying it indoors for a day and night, it worked normally.
　　There was no water in the can at all.
　　There is enough room in the can to keep a lighter in it.
