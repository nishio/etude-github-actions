History of the Birth of the Central Limit Theorem
	Newton] and [Leibniz] formulated integrals independently in the late 17th century
	1730 [de Moivre] found [Sterling's formula https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%81%AE%E8%BF%91%E4% BC%BC] #Stirling's formula Found
 In 1773, de Moivre formulated the [normal distribution] in the form of an approximation of the [binomial distribution
 	Binomial distribution becomes normal with n → ∞
 	[Laplace] elaborates, this approximation is called [Laplace's theorem
	1838 [Poisson distribution], mathematician [Simeon Denis Poisson].
 	When p is small enough, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution

	1922 [Central Limit Theorem https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E6%A5%B5%E9%99%90%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86] #Central Limit Theorem
