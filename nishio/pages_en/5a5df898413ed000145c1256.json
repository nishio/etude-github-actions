 >Dawn ([Technology Trigger], Technology Trigger) - The first phase of the hype cycle begins with a "technology trigger" or breakthrough. New product announcements and other events generate media coverage and interest.
 >Prevalence Phase ([Peak of Inflated Expectations], Peak of Inflated Expectations) - In the next phase, there is a great deal of public attention, often resulting in undue excitement and unrealistic expectations. Sometimes success stories emerge, but many end in failure.
 >Disillusionment Phase ([Trough of Disillusionment]) - Technology rapidly loses interest and enters the "Hollow of Disillusionment" when it fails to live up to excessive expectations. The media then stops covering the topic and the technology.
 >Recovery Phase ([Slope of Enlightenment], Slope of Enlightenment) - While the technology is no longer covered in the media, some businesses continue to climb the "slope of enlightenment" and come to understand its benefits and how to apply it.
 >Stabilization Phase ([Plateau of Productivity], Plateau of Productivity) - When a technology gains widespread publicity and acceptance, it reaches the "plateau of productivity". The technology gradually stabilizes and evolves into the second and third generations. The final elevation of that plateau varies, depending on whether the technology is broadly applicable or only in [niche] markets.
