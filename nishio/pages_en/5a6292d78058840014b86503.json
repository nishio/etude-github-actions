Why do social networking sites rise and fall?
2018-01-20
	The early stage is a group of [early adopters].
 There is an effect of accumulation of [social relational capital] in creating a network in that group (pointed out by [tokoroten]).
 As it spreads, [the late majority] comes in.
 Human resource density becomes diluted and less useful.
 Early adopters move to another [SNS].

	It is not limited to social networking sites. Communities of fans are also initially a group of early adopters, but as name recognition increases, the late majority joins and dilution occurs.

	The same principle may apply to [big business disease].
 	At the time of its founding, the company was a group of early adopters
  After becoming a large corporation, the late majority will join the company.
  The promotion of the late majority will affect some behavior.

	Late majorities are associated with [risk-averse] tendencies.
  [Prospect Theory]
  When the expected value of utility increases slowly but with risk, the less risk-averse will enter the market sooner.

 >The social networking sites where the old man came in, that's the end of the problem, and this can be explained by the [social capital] aspect.
 >In the early years, the network is converted to social capital because of all the early adopters.
 >When laggardly old men come in, they don't increase social capital when they connect, but rather they mount up and suck up social capital.

 Backlash against the accumulation of social capital
 	We destroyed the aristocracy and made it a democracy.
		Aristocracy is a system in which certain [social capital] is inherited.
  Causing a backlash of what you don't have.

Pointing out that good networking can occur on the side that remains.

>With all the mid-level and above creators who wanted to make money migrating to Youtube, Nico Nico Douga was left with only those who do what they want to do without regard to profit and those who enjoy doing it.
> As a result, the awkwardness that existed at the time of the start of the "Crisis Award" has disappeared, and Nico Nico Douga now seems to have come full circle, with an atmosphere similar to that of the early days of Nico Nico Douga.
