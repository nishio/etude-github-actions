There is no right answer.
 The phrase "[there is] no correct answer" is too stripped down of words, leaving it open to interpretation.

 I say, "[There is] a right answer."
 	There is a solution given by authority.
  An authority guarantees the correctness of the solution.
  A solution that is useful but not accepted by an authority is not considered to be a correct solution
 This refers to a situation where the
	No right answer" is the opposite situation.
 	No one gives me a solution.
  No one can guarantee the correctness of the solution.

	In light of this, the phrase "there is no correct answer" can be supplemented with "there is no solution that is guaranteed to be correct by an authority.

 Schooling tends to have the right answer.
 	Two times four is a circle, four times two is a cross.
  'We haven't taught fractions and decimals yet, so 2 divided by 3 isn't 1.5 or 1 and 1/2, it's 1 too much.'
  In high school physics, I was told, "You can solve this by setting up a differential equation, but the curriculum says that differential equations are not taught in high school, so don't put it in your answer sheet.
  The answer at this time of year is determined by whether it is "right" or not.
  	The standard of correctness is set by the authority.
   Problems that have no right answer are judged not by whether they are right, but by whether they are useful. For example, for the unanswerable problem of reducing poverty, a good answer is to do what you think is useful and actually obtain useful results.
