	with a "weak learner" that can only cut vertically or horizontally.
	Study "difficult problems" such as (1, 1) above right.
 	A difficult problem that cannot be expressed by a single horizontal and vertical cut in the first place.
	Let's say that in the first test you answered like (1, 2), cut vertically and to the right of it.
 	The red text in the upper left (1, 4) is in the wrong place.
	The next time you study, focus on the problem that you got wrong (2, 1).
	Suppose that in the second test, the answer is (2, 2).
		Combining the two answers (2, 3), notice that the two in the center are not known to be A or B (2, 4).
	The third study will focus on these central two (3, 1).
 Suppose that on the third test, you cut horizontally and answered as (3, 2).
		The student correctly learns to take a majority vote of three answers (3, 3) (3, 4) and the question (1, 1).
