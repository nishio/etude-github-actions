 Thoughts.
 　[Maximize Mean]
 　I wonder if we can transform the equation similar to [maximizing the ratio of sums
 　Maximizing the mean is [maximizing the ratio of the sums], special cases such that the denominators are all 1
 　　You can transform the formula, sort it, greedy from larger, bisection search, and you're good to go.
 　　Since the denominators are all the same value, they disappear in the equation transformation and end up sorted by value from largest to smallest
 　We are also told to seek the maximum number of pieces
 　　When choosing from the larger number, the last form is to choose k from the same n. Here n to k is the number of combinations to choose from.
 公式解説
 　omission from consideration
 　　There is a range in the number of pieces to choose from.
 　　Generally speaking, if you choose from the larger number, increasing the number of pieces to choose from will only lower the average.
 　　　The exception is when the average value and the increasing value are the same, i.e., when there are many things with the highest value and you only select the ones with the highest value.
 　　　Counting at this time requires one more step.
