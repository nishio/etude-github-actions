[Tadashi Yanai] "[One win and nine losses]"

So you need to reduce the risk according to your [risk tolerance].
	[Limitation of risk]

Risk tolerance is a human attribute
	For example, a junior high school student worries about buying a 2,000 yen technical book and borrows an old book from the library instead of buying it in the end.
	On the other hand, working engineers think that a 2,000 yen technical book is cheap, and buy it immediately without checking its reputation.
 What is the difference? It is the difference in risk tolerance for "buying books"
 The difference in disposable income is one factor, but I think the difference in risk-taking experience is more significant.

Risk tolerance is a person's attribute, and no one but you can adjust it to match your risk tolerance.
