My Relationship with Unexplored
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1579741480348168193 @nishio]: I've illustrated my involvement with IPA Unexplored, Unexplored Corp, Unexplored Jr. and myself, as a verbal explanation doesn't quite get the point across!

>When you think about it, you've already been involved in [unexplored] for more than half of your life.
> The green dots are dots that represent my involvement in current students' projects as an alumnus at the request of the IPA, but only at events, not all the time.
> I wrote this because Cybozu Labs is my employer and they are very understanding of my activities and the activities of the Unexplored Foundation are part of my work hours.
