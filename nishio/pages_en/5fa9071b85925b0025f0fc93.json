 Thoughts.
  900 in the high 900's
   And 900 more to spare.
  Let's explore all of them naively.
   Try the smaller ones, and if they don't work, try the larger ones.
	code:python
	 def solve(N, M, K, data):
      from collections import Counter
      ret = 1
      for y in range(N):
          for x in range(M):
              for w in range(ret + 1, min(N - y + 1, M - x + 1)):
                  c = Counter(data[y + i][x + j]
                              for i in range(w)
                              for j in range(w))
  
                  mc = c.most_common(1)[0][1]
                  if mc + K >= w * w:
                      ret = w
  
      return ret
