Bias to focus on what you have researched on your own
>[kentaro https://twitter.com/kentaro/status/1637277082718986240] There is a [bias] to value what you have researched on your own over what you have been taught. Even if the information is the same, it becomes more personal when you have researched it by yourself rather than being told by others. [It makes you feel more comfortable with the information. This is not always a good thing. Even if the information is wrong, you will ignore the correct information given by others and focus on what you have researched.
> If you are unaware of your bias, you will fall into the same structure as when you are addicted to [conspiracy theories] on YouTube. You are simply being recommended, but you think you are [proactively] discovering the mysteries of the world one after another. The same structure may occur in a system like [ChatGPT]. Be aware of bias.
