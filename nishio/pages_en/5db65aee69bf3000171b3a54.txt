Just as the fully qualified class name java.lang.String is guaranteed to be unique in Java, while the name String is used without qualification, so too in natural languages where it is sufficiently qualified to eliminate blurring of meaning (e.g., "[Engelbert's Four Categories] in [Artifact]"), but abbreviated (e.g., simply as "Artifact").

In programming languages, explicit importing uniquely defines how names are resolved in scope, but in natural languages, there is no explicit importing, so implicit importing varies from person to person
