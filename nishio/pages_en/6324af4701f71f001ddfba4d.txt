Equivalent exchange of labor and wages
Someone on a social networking site remarked, "[Equivalent exchange] of [labor] and [wages]," and I thought this phrase was interesting.
Whether he intended it or not, since he says "labor power and ~" instead of "equivalent exchange of [working hours] and wages," he is of course affirming that the "more powerful" will get more for the same hours of work.
