 	misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world than trickery and malice. At any rate, the last two are certainly much less frequent.
  [Misunderstanding] and [neglect] create more confusion than [trickery] and [malice]. Subtlety and malice are less frequent than [misunderstanding] and [disregard].
  	Neglect] is a word used to [ignore], [disregard], [neglect], [neglect to pay attention], etc.
		[Malice is less frequent than misunderstanding.]

Don't find [malice] in what is adequately explained by [incompetence].
