	The gap between reality and ideals creates the power to change.
		[Creative Tension]
	But often there are forces that impede change.
		[Feeling of "I can't do it."]
	It would be beneficial to break it down.
	"[Why do you think it can't be done?"
	There are a number of reasons why you can't do it.
	The reason is [fact or interpretation].
	Is the reason for this [physical constraints]?
		If it's not a [physical constraint], we can change it.
			[Policy Constraints]

At the level of abstraction in this diagram, I think it could work, but I'm not sure it would in reality.
	I feel like digging into the negative side is a streak.
		[PRO Model]

Similarly, decompositions of reality and ideals can be established
	That's [Current Situation Analysis Tree] and [Future Analysis Tree].
