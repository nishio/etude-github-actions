Evaluated without merit.
When person A sees person B who is [evaluated] by many people and feels that he is evaluated even though he has no [ability], "Mr. B has no ability" is not a fact but A's interpretation.

Either "B is not competent and the multitude [overestimates] those who are not competent" or "A is not competent to recognize B's competence."
