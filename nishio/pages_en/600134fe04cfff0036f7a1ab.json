PIP for myself
I'm not enthusiastic enough to register with PyPI, but I'll put the code pieces that I want to use in multiple projects on Github so that I can install them with pip.
Fixing the version and keeping it up-to-date can be done by the pip itself, so there is less to think about.

 Write setup.py

 First, make sure you can pip install on your local file system
  $ pip install .
 Push to Github
 Make sure you can pip install from Github
  $ pip install git+https://github.com/nishio/rich_tokenizer


ã€€This seems to lose the information about the install from git when pip freeze is done.
ã€€ $ pip install git+https://github.com/nishio/rich_tokenizer
 This looks good.
		$ pip install -e git+https://github.com/nishio/rich_tokenizer#egg=rich_tokenizer
	This would output `-e git+https://github.com/nishio/rich_tokenizer@4284.... .af7e#egg=rich_tokenizer
