Derivation of the inverse modulo group asymptotic formula
In [Division by the remainder group], Euclid's reciprocal division method is used to find the inverse, which takes O(log(N)) for each calculation.
In the case of creating [the inverse table] in a lump, there is an incremental formula that can be created with O(1) for one and O(N) for all.
	`inv[a] = MOD - inv[MOD % a] * (MOD / a) % MOD;`
	code:python
  for i in range(2, P):
      q, r = divmod(P, i)
      INV[i] = -INV[r] * q % P

d
Suppose the quotient of P divided by a is q and the remainder is r (`q, r = divmod(P, a)`)
　The following equation holds
	[$ P = aq + r]
	mod P for both sides
	[$ 0 \equiv aq + r]
	Multiply by the inverse of a
	[$ 0 \equiv q + a^{-1}r]
	transpose q
	[$ -q \equiv a^{-1}r]
　Multiply by the inverse of r
	[$ -qr^{-1} \equiv a^{-1}]
　The inverse of a could be obtained using the inverse of r smaller than a
　Just ask for the inverse yuan in order of decreasing size.
