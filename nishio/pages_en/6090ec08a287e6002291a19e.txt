 <BODY>I have been looking at this since v0.2, and it is difficult to see the cheat sheet/procedure sheet/reference definitions mixed together. <BR>It seems that the image of who you want this sheet to read is unclear and not solidified. <br><br>I will list some minor points. <br>- The intent is for the reader to see the coherence in order, but it is not clear where the coherence begins and ends. 1-1/1-2 is only written in numbers, the same letters as the text. <br>- There should be more than just 1-1/1-2, there should be command/explanation/supplement/title<br>- I can't distinguish between explanation, input, and output<br>- The arrows don't make sense because they are not pointing to the object<br>- I don't know what the green and yellow coloring is intended to do (emphasis?) I don't understand (emphasis? Classification?) If it is emphasis, the color should be more of a warning, and if it is classification, it should be separated as a figure. <br>- Is it appropriate to belong to a cohesive grouping such as 1-1/1-2? Diagrams that are referenced from multiple items should be independent of the cohesion<br>- Is the line above "changes and their UNDOs" absolutely necessary? <br><br>I don't mean to be presumptuous. </body>

 <body>I think it would be nice if the cheat sheet covered "this and that that we sometimes need but tend to forget", so you can leave config and that stuff to the tutorial and skip it. <br>I thought the diagrams of changes and their UNDOs were good and easy to understand in that sense. <br>And I thought the arrows would be annoying if they covered the text. </body>
