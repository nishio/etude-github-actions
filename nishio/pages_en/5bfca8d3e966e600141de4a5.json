The etymology of the system, monetization of goods that are easy to replicate, and the story of the system are mixed up.

Just as in the past, the image of physical commodities was abstracted to become "[goods]," and the image of concrete money was abstracted to become "[capital]," and concrete work became "the [extended reproduction] of capital," the Ichiba, which exchanged money for goods, is abstracted to become "[market] (shijo). The market is a system that increases liquidity. Markets are [systems] that increase liquidity.

The word "system" is another abstraction that came about as a result of abstraction.

In primitive times, most of them were non-combination objects such as "water" and "acorns," but as civilization progressed, people began to create objects that functioned by combining elements, such as "stag" and "bow. The Greek word for [combination] is [etymology of the word system].

In abstracting physical objects into "goods," the ease of reproduction was discarded. This is because some physical objects are easy to reproduce and others are not. On the other hand, it has become known over the past 20 years that it is difficult to directly exchange [easy-to-replicate] goods for money that cannot be replicated, and monetization through the [advertising model] has been considered.

Monetization in the advertising model is a model in which, since a certain easily duplicable good is difficult to directly exchange for money, the user is allowed to use the good free of charge, thereby generating another hard-to-replicate good called views, which are then given to the person who wants the views in order to earn money. Conversely, the [subscription] model reduces the ease of reproduction. If you don't keep paying, you lose [access rights].
