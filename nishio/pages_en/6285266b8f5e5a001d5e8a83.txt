Maybe 25 sheets would be a good first step to experience the KJ method.
I was thinking that KJ method is very beneficial starting around 100 sheets, but 25 sheets might be a good first step in learning KJ method.

Q: Why 25 sheets?
　The scale is about the same as "5 groups of 5 sheets" (5×5=25) or "3 groups of 3 sheets each" (3×3×3=27).
　If it is less than this, say 10 sheets, you won't feel much effect.

Of course, if you think of something new during the work, you can add it by writing it down on a sticky note.

Reasons for this idea:.
 Work where the goal (purpose, what is obtained) is not visible should be minimized.
