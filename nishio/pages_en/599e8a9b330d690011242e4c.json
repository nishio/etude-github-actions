 In noticing blind spots, it is beneficial to ask others for their opinions and [reserve judgment] and write them down.
 I've asked people, "What do you think about this problem?" When I ask someone "What do you think about this problem?" and they reply, I tend to say "No, that's not right" or "You talk about a lot of things, but that's not what I'm looking for" or "That's not a valid solution, so it's useless" or "I shut it out" and throw it away. For some reason, I tend to do this.
 Instead, take "at least this person thinks this" or "this person thinks this is relevant" and write it down, and then think about it carefully.
