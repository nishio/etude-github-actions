Bug when adding multiple stickies
	When multiple lines are poured in add sticky mode,
  The first blank sticky hasn't been erased.
  The last sticky I added is still designated as editable.
  After editing, Undo will not undo the edits.
	Batch import of multiple lines of stickies does not seem to be causing updates on the read-only side.
	This feature is only exposed in development mode, so the fix is a low priority.
