	Chapter 3, "Economics that have Moved the Times," is a good overview of the currents as it is explained in chronological order.
 	Contrary to the title, it explains how it came into being before the birth of macroeconomics.

 [Leviathan] v.s. [civil government theory] The idea that value is added by labor
 [Adam Smith] Absolute Advantage v.s. Rickard's [Comparative Advantage].
 [Adam Smith] [labor value theory] v.s. [marginal utility theory] → [cessation by Marshall].
 Neoclassical microeconomics v.s. [Keynesian] school macroeconomics → [cessation by Hicks].
	1961-1963 Kennedy Administration + Keynesians → full employment
 1963-1969 Johnson Administration: Medicare
 	Vietnam war
 	Government spending at full employment leads to inflation.
 1969-1974 Nixon Administration
  1971 Dollar shock + price wage freeze treatment + 10% surcharge on imports
  1973 Oil crisis
  Inflation does not stop despite recession [stagflation].
  Keynesian cannot cope with stagflation because it is an aggregate demand management policy
  Inflation expanded until 1982, tripling prices in 17 years (6.5% per annum).
	A New Wave of Keynesian Discreditation
 	[Monetarism]
   Milton [Friedman] (1912-2006).
   	[Freedom of Choice 1977
    Keynesians went too far and went beyond the natural unemployment rate to full employment.
    That policy causes inflation.
    [Monetary illusion] makes people unaware that inflation is causing real reductions in value.
    	Monetary illusion: a 5% increase in payroll with 10% inflation is a reduction in real terms, but is mistakenly thought to be an increase
     [Monetary illusion - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B2%A8%E5%B9%A3%E9%8C%AF%E8%A6%9A]
     The result is a reduction in real terms and an increase in nominal terms, with an increase in supply thinking it is an increase.
    When it is widely understood that inflation is occurring?
    [Phillips curve]
    	Rigidity in nominal wages prevents salaries from increasing at the same rate as inflation
     The resulting inflationary increase would effectively reduce salaries.
     The volume of employment increases (if not at full employment) in response to lower labor prices
     But inflation at full employment will not add any more jobs.
     And?
  [Rational Expectation Formation Hypothesis]
   Lucas.
			People try to act rationally by factoring in future inflation expectations (forecasts)
	Relatively new idea
 	[Game Theory]: Because people have conflicting interests, even if each individual makes a rational decision based on his or her own interests, the whole may fall into a suboptimal solution.
  [Behavioral Economics]: People's decisions are not rational to begin with.
		[Information asymmetry]: →[contract theory].
