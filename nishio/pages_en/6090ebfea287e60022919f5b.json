 However, it was not a hot spring at all because I jumped into the space left by people leaving on the last train after the end of the hot spring.
 
 My personal summary
 
 :<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B000BIUQJG?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& <a href="creativeASIN=B000BIUQJG">Gokiburi Poker</a>: A game where you have 8 cards each with 8 different kinds of pests on them, and you turn them face down and say, "This is a cockroach," and give them to someone to play like a douche. You lose if your cards run out and you can't play them when you should, or if you are forced to play four cards of the same type. If the player says, "It's always my turn," he or she dies. I was very weak, I played 3 times and only lost when I played with 2 and 3 players, not when I played with 6 players.
 :<del>Penguin Pyramid? </del><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001409X7G?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& creativeASIN=B001409X7G">Penguin Party</a>: A game in which you stack penguins distributed in a pyramid (triangle) of eight per side, each with seven cards (only green has eight cards) with penguins of five colors on them. The penguins can only be placed on the bottom layer or higher if both the right and left bottom layers are filled and one of them is the same color as the card you want to place. If all the red cards are placed, the player with red cards in his or her hand will be in tears. If all the cards are placed, the player receives a penalty of 2 points. The winner is decided by the score at the end of the first round. The cards placed at the very bottom of the pyramid, even if they are not interfered with at all, can only be placed eight at a time, and when you want to place a card, you simply cannot because the second card is not placed. In the end, the pyramid has never been completed!
 Shark Alert: Doubt consisting of 32 sharks and 32 dolphins. You win when you have 3 more shark cards than the second place or when you collect 7 dolphins. If you have a shark card in your field, you can turn over a face-down card in someone else's field, and if it is a shark, it is yours. If it is a dolphin, the dolphin comes to your hand and the shark goes to the other side. what a mistake I made in the first round, I plugged it in and died.
 oGFx:It's easy to make cool videos, but you can't show them to people unless you at least have a video export function! I can't shoot while rendering or machine power-wise!
 :<del>Magic something</del><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0015D8I0U?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=B0015D8I0U">Something Magical</a>: A game where you do various things to score points. The game is a game where you have to do something to score points. You have three kinds of ingredients for magic potions and money, and you have to make a lot of magic potions and test tubes. At the beginning of each round, you choose 5 cards from 12 different occupation (action) cards. For example, if you play a card to get an ingredient and someone else has it, your occupation card will be wasted.
 
 
 I can't help but think there was at least one more. Oh, I remember now.
 
 :<del>Chameleon something</del><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0002HZ7VS?ie=UTF8&tag=ikunoz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative= 7399&creativeASIN=B0002HZ7VS">Colorette</a>: A game to collect chameleons. The score increases progressively depending on the number of pieces. However, from the fourth color onward, the more chameleons you collect, the more points you lose. You don't want to take the colors you don't need, but you have to take all the cards in the pile. Look at the pile of garbage." If you are indecisive, you may end up picking up a pile of garbage you don't want, or if you are in a hurry to pick up cards because you don't want to mix in garbage, you may not get any points later on.
 
 *1237749558* Penguin Party
 <a href='http://www.mobius-games.co.jp/Amigo/Ping-Party.html'>Penguin Party</a>
 
 I would like to have a repeat game with two or three people, because with six people, the factor of other people's behavior is too great.
