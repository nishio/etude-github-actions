	Windows
	Ubuntu with Hyper-V
	I wanted to use the cloud because I didn't want to accidentally put a file on my desktop and have to say, "Oh, that file is only on my desktop! I want to take advantage of the cloud.
		All local files are just a cache.
	I'll set up a stationary machine at work as a place for "programs that keep running with a large amount of memory reserved".
	(TODO) A process that is always alive on the desktop machine watches for Dropbox updates and automatically converts new PDFs to images when they come in -> Gyazo -> OCR -> upload to Scrapbox
	(TODO) Move Slack&Mattermost Bot, which is taking quite a long time to wake up after talking to me because it is now running on Heroku, to the desktop so that it can handle the heavy memory consumption by BERT and others.
