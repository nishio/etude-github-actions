 *1256260175*[iPhone][ObjC] error: synthesized property 'foobar' must either be named the same as a compatible ivar or must explicitly name an ivar
 I'm working on an app that requires an actual device to test important functions, and I thought I could use the simulator to create other functions, so I switched to the SDK and now I get this error.
 
 >>
 error: synthesized property 'foobar' must either be named the same as a compatible ivar or must explicitly name an ivar
 <<
 
 put simply
 >|objc|
 @interface BazQuux {
 }
 @property (nonatomic, retain) FooBarType *foobar;
 ||<
 The SDK for the iPhone can be built with the SDK for the actual device, but the SDK for the simulator cannot.
 >|objc|
 @interface BazQuux {
     FooBarType *foobar;
 }
 @property (nonatomic, retain) FooBarType *foobar;
 ||<
 I was puzzled by the error message under @synthesize foobar;. I was perplexed by the error message under @synthesize foobar;.
 
 >>
 error: synthesized property 'foobar' must either be named the same as a compatible ivar or must explicitly name an ivar
 <<
 
 The property 'foobar' to be @synthesized must be named the same as the assignment-compatible ivar or must be explicitly marked with ivar.
 
 <hr>
 In addition, the page below claims that the first code should work according to the specification, and that this is a bug in the SDK for the simulator.

 Note that I almost went without cash in my wallet.
 
 What you need to have

 Should I have it? Things

 *1256287521*[ObjC]Animation to flip
 I got stuck because I mistakenly put the unit of [UIView setAnimationDuration:1] as 1000, thinking it was milliseconds, which made it look like the animation was not set properly (in fact, it was super slow).
 >|ObjC|
 	[UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL];
 	[UIView setAnimationDuration:1];
 	[UIView setAnimationTransition:([self.optionView superview] ?
 	UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromLeft : UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromRight)
 	forView:self.view cache:YES];
 	if ([self.optionView superview]){
 		[self.optionView removeFromSuperview];
 		[self.view addSubview:self.mainView];
 	}else{
 		[self.mainView removeFromSuperview];
 		[self.view addSubview:self.optionView];
 	}
 	
 	[UIView commitAnimations];
