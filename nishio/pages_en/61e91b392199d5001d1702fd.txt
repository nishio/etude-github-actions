[❸ Photo reading]

The most characteristic part of the Whole Mind System is this photo reading step. In Photo Reading step, you blur the focus of your eyes and look at the whole page. You read 2 pages in 1 to 2 seconds. It is 3 to 5 minutes with a 300-page book.

Paul Scheele says that even if you do not feel you can read, the information on the book goes into your brain. It is the most controversial point of the book. I also tried this photo reading for a while, but I do not use it now because I can not feel it effective. 

It may make an effect on the people who [speak quietly] during reading books. Photo reading makes them experience faster reading. The experience helps the separation of reading and speaking.
