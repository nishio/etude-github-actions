	Talking about what to do with access rights, depends on what kind of demonstration you want to do.
		For example, if it is displayed at an event, it would be interesting to have a demo that "displays a QR code, and when you take a picture of it, it becomes a writing page and you can post a sticky note.
		To do this, you need "anyone can write in".
	But, well, maybe we should use the YAGNI principle and leave it alone until we have a clear situation that we specifically want to demonstrate.
