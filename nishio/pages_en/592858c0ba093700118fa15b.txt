Reading too slowly interferes with understanding.
>When I was reading "The Serendipity of Random Reading" by Shigehiko Toyama, I came across the term "[rhetorical afterimage]". He pointed out that reading too slowly can hinder comprehension, because the memory ("afterimage") of the previous sentence remains and promotes comprehension of the sentence. This is close to my own feeling.
