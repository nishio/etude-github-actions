Writing and Scheduling

	>>@golden_lucky But I still don't know how to help with that, because I have a deep-seated awareness that writing is not a process that follows a schedule. I mean, even the process of reading and editing a written manuscript cannot proceed according to schedule, so there is a high possibility that I am simply a social misfit.
 As someone who wrote a three-week iteration of a chapter on an engineer's intellectual production techniques, I think "it doesn't go according to schedule" is a thought-stopping cop-out. On the other hand, I also once extended a deadline by a week, so "proceeding according to schedule" is also wrong. I think "writing is either on schedule or it isn't" is a false dichotomy.
 One of the hardest causes of schedule disruption is "I originally planned to write one chapter, but when I wrote it, there are two or three chapters" or "I planned to write one chapter, but when I wrote it, there are only four pages", but if you write out 100 sticky notes per chapter in advance, the volume of output will not be that much. If you write out 100 sticky notes per chapter in advance, the volume of the output will not vary that much.
 Instead of trying to execute "writing" [an ambiguous huge task] as it is, writing first in a shallow and messy style and then writing properly will increase [the probability of successful estimation] of the scale.
 	An approach that tries to prevent [poor scale estimation] with the [towed bullet] of early prototyping.
	It is not that writing has unique circumstances, it is just that "intellectual production is difficult to estimate in advance" just like any other task. It is essentially the same as software development or research management. And "difficult" in "difficult to estimate" is not "impossible," but "there is room for improvement through ingenuity.
