I would like to discuss the design of Regroup
	I went from not being clear on what I wanted to discuss to writing it down anyway.
	I thought I just wrote it down and solved it before I consulted with him, but after consulting with him, I realized that the solution I went through was the best one, surprisingly, because I thought it wasn't good enough beforehand.
	Specifically.
	　I had noticed but unintentionally ignored the idea of using the keyboard for parallel movement [I would like to discuss the design of Regroup #6077ff00aff09e00008ebf98].
	　　In retrospect, I was subconsciously thinking about when I'd use it on my iPad, and I figured there was no way I'd have a keyboard hooked up to it.
  In "What else can you tell me about paralleling?" The first question was "Inconvenient to operate on a PC" and the second question was "What's the value? and "It would be nice if it could be operated without stress" in "What is the value?
  I thought about "what needs to happen" to "operate stress-free on a PC" and realized that shift dragging uses both the keyboard and pointing device, so it would rather be less stressful to complete the shift using only the keyboard.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I would like to discuss the design of [nishio.icon]Regroup
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "Regroup" is that "Regroup"?
[nishio.icon]Listen first.
[nisbot.icon]Yes
[nishio.icon]Regroup was originally created based on the premise of using two-finger gestures to zoom in and out and move in parallel on an iPad. The original problem was that the computer screen is too small for electronic KJ, and the hypothesis was that smooth scaling would solve this problem.
[nisbot.icon]「Regroup」
[nishio.icon]Since I use a Macbook for development, it would be more convenient to be able to perform all operations on the Macbook, so two-finger up/down zooming is used, which is converted to a wheel event, Shift-drag.
[nisbot.icon] "Scaling"
[nishio.icon]Zooming in and out on the iPad works in the same way as Google Maps: "Zoom in and out as an image of the currently rendered content, and re-render after the operation is complete. However, this method could not be used because wheel events do not have an explicit end. The only thing I did was to adjust the zoom value for each arrival of the wheel event. In the first place, the operation on the PC was intended for debugging purposes.
[nisbot.icon] "Scaling"
[nishio.icon]I was trying to make a tutorial for Keicho-Regroup integration, and since it is difficult to assume that the user has an iPad to begin with, I thought it needed to be usable on a PC as well. (I just realized that half of the users use their smartphones to open Regroup on a small screen, so I need to advise them to open it on a larger screen.)
[nisbot.icon]「Regroup」
[nishio.icon], and I wanted to consult with you about what I should do because I find it inconvenient to actually use it on my PC. Before I consulted you, I asked, "Would it be nice if there were hotkeys because it's a pain to press the mode-switching button?" Or, "Would it be nice to have a key that zooms out to where you can see the whole picture?" But as we talked, I thought that the implementation of zooming in and out was not well thought out in the first place.
[nisbot.icon] "Scaling"
[nishio.icon]Ideally, it would be the same two-finger gesture as on the iPad, but there's a good chance that browser apps won't be able to capture it; there's still the problem of people who aren't on Macbooks not being able to use it; the problems that have been solved on the iPad and not on the PC are actually parallel shifts.
[nisbot.icon]「iPad」
[nishio.icon]On the iPad, both scaling and translating are two-finger gestures, so I can use the lasso selection mode without switching modes. On the other hand, on the Macbook, I had to switch modes to use it. Shift-drag is rather appropriate for "use without switching modes," but I didn't use it.
[nisbot.icon] "Scaling"
[nishio.icon]During the implementation process, "parallel shift mode" was created first, and this is still the default mode. In this mode, dragging a sticky moves it, and dragging the screen moves it parallel. Later, when I wanted to move multiple stickies at once, lasso mode was added, and it seemed silly to switch modes when moving only one sticky at a time, so lasso mode was used to move a sticky at a time. It is now a mode that is used only for parallel movement on a PC.
[nisbot.icon] "Parallel shift"
[nishio.icon]There are two ways to move the viewpoint parallel without switching modes: one is to use the keyboard and the other is to create a mini-map. It would be nice to have a mini-map, but it is unknown how much the cost of drawing one would increase.
[nisbot.icon] "Parallel shift"
In terms of eliminating [nishio.icon] parallel mode, some people are afraid of accidentally manipulating it and breaking it, so the default should be a non-editing mode.
[nisbot.icon] "Parallel shift"
[nishio.icon]I came to a conclusion before I used any in-depth questions, but I felt that my next action would be to "prohibit mode switching to parallel movement mode, try using it, and find out what I'm not satisfied with.
[nisbot.icon] "Parallel shift"
[nishio.icon]The End
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]It would have been nice if the current vague awareness of the problem was clarified and the next action was set in stone.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I came to a conclusion before I used any in-depth questions, but I thought my next action would be to prohibit mode switching in the parallel mode, try using it, and find out what I'm not satisfied with.
 What kind of "parallel shift" is this "parallel shift"?
[nishio.icon] Moving the viewpoint to look at different places on the map.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I came to a conclusion before I used any in-depth questions, but I thought my next action would be to prohibit mode switching in the parallel mode, try using it, and find out what I'm not satisfied with.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "parallel shift"?
[nishio.icon]I was inconvenienced by having to do that on a PC.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice to be able to operate and organize stickies without stress.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I came to a conclusion before I used any in-depth questions, but I thought my next action would be to prohibit mode switching in the parallel mode, try using it, and find out what I'm not satisfied with.
 How do you know this "parallel shift"?
[nishio.icon]I forgot about the shift drag function myself, users don't know of course, so I need a guide.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I came to a conclusion before I used any in-depth questions, but I thought my next action would be to prohibit mode switching in the parallel mode, try using it, and find out what I'm not satisfied with.
 What do you hope will happen with respect to this "parallel shift"?
[nishio.icon]It should be stress-free and intuitive.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "parallel shift" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]At least not the one that requires you to switch modes. Making users press the shift key is also rather subtle. Many people are used to keyboard operation through games and the like, so it may be possible to dismiss it as such. The mini-map is also explicit in the sense that you can switch viewpoints, but you have to move the cursor to the mini-map, look at it carefully, and click. Given that, perhaps keyboard parallelism is surprisingly the most promising?
[nisbot.icon] As for "parallel shift", can it be done?
[nishio.icon]I can try that feature on for you.

 Where does this "parallel shift" come from?
