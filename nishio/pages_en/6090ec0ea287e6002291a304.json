 When the cover image of this book appeared on my Facebook timeline, I laughed and showed it to my wife, and we were both excited about why they chose such a font, but when I read it, it was surprisingly good.

 The book can be summarized in five pages with bullet points. The book is kindly summarized in five pages. What is excellent is the way the book is put into a story that is easy to read. I started the book wanting to know why the font was the way it was, but I was drawn in and read the whole thing, and then I read it a second time because I wanted to read it again. I wish I could write books like this.
 
 Also, people often say "look the other person in the eye and talk to them," but until I read this book I didn't understand what looking in the eyes could tell me. I guess it is a red light/green light so to speak.
 
 Several other patterns of communication that make others uncomfortable are also mentioned, and are recommended for those who are not good communicators themselves.
