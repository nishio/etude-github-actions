Implementation of [Support for splitting long text into stickies

As long as the success rate of sticky splitting is not 100%, I'm wondering if there are times when you see the converted result and want to go back.

 	Undo？

　In the video above, the text before conversion remains on the right.
　　Worst case scenario, I can copy and paste from here.
　　But I fixed this one.
　　　If this is not updated, the "next longest line" will not be known and cannot be split.
　　Do you want to show the last split separately?
　　　Copy and paste from there?
　　　　I want it back in one click, not copy and paste.
　　　　→ That's an undo!
　　　With this style, you can not only "revert all" but also "revert some" or "edit with reference to the original text".

		I'm struggling with that, but I can't think of a good way to do it, so I think it would be better to do it the simple way for now, and then make it more clear how it would make me happy when I use it, in the YAGNI sense.
  I'm currently hitting the API by pressing a button for each line, but I'm starting to think that as a user, you don't want one line to be split, you want all lines that are over 20 characters long to be split with the click of a button. I'm starting to think that's the case.

 Return focus to text area when button is pressed
　You should also change the cursor position appropriately.
