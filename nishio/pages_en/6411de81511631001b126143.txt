Most people don't recognize change at the moment of change.
You make the implicit assumption that "it's easy for me to observe."
　This assumption is wrong in many cases.
　When we observe something, we have its existence. But when you don't observe something, you don't know if it exists or not.
　　[Successful testing does not imply the absence of bugs.]
　Change causes a larger change [rolling snowball] process occurs and is observed when large enough

relevance
　[The future already exists.]
