square block
>Boxes can collapse while being stacked. Math knowledge is a square block. In mathematics, knowledge is square blocks, whereas blocks in other fields are a bit awkward. In mathematics, the blocks are stacked so precisely that you can build very tall towers. You get to a very high level of abstraction. But in other fields, if you try to stack them in the same way as in mathematics, they collapse. So you have to collect a lot of information and stack it in a pyramid, with many boxes supporting it.

>In principle, I doubt that the concept of [logic] exists there. It's just the result of a chain of probabilities that results in a somewhat logical answer.

Logic is a mechanism that allows you to build a [tall tower] with many [layers] by using only [building blocks] that are [100% certain], and you can't do the same thing if you have a large supply of [90% correct blocks].
