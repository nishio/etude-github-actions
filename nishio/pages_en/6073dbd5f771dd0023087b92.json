Homo sapiens supremacy
Some people think that [Homo sapiens] is "superior" or "something to be protected" to other species of organisms or computers simply because they are "Homo sapiens," but I am not sure what justification they have for this.

Carelessly saying "[computer rights]" tends to lead to discussions like "[what is a person]? It is better to keep it simple, "Why do you think it has value?" It is better to keep it to "Why do you think it has value?
