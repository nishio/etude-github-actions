minimum area tree
→[Kruskal method].

The Kruskal method is O(E log E)
When E is too big to make it in time
　The [prim method], when combined with the [Fibonacci heap], yields O(E+V log V)
　　Even with a naive [binary heap], O((E+V)log V)
　O(E) if E can be sorted in linear time.
　 →[linear time sorting].
