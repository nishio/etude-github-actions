Update with immer and test with Cypress
I was able to [expose ReactN and use it from Cypress],
Update the status with [immer] and test with [Cypress].

It's done.
code:test.js
 cy.contains("DEF").should("have.css", "width", "260px");
 cy.window()
   .its("movidea")
   .then((movidea) => {
     movidea.updateGlobal((g) => {
       g.itemStore["3"].scale = 3;
     });
   });
 cy.contains("DEF").should("have.css", "width", "390px");

By the way, the test code is the default JS, but this makes the g in updateGlobal any.
I'm going to Typo sooner or later because completion doesn't work... and then I immediately Typo and say "I updated the position but the position doesn't change, aren't you reading the position value when you draw? The position isn't updating?" And I did.

Continued [Cypress to TypeScript].
