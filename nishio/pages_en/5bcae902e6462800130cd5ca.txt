The idea that "Mr. X is better at this than me, so I don't have to do it myself" often appears, so I caution myself against it.
If you don't do it because you're not that interested, that's fine.
If you are interested but think "Mr. X is better at this" and let it disappear without taking any action.
It's just "[looking for] reasons not to do it.
I want to find something that I can have [passion for].
