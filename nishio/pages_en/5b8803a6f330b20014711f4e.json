Two objectives in one project
[https://gyazo.com/cc5d5a1aacb54367c93fa52feb99f4d4]

 1 Seemingly one project, goal is a mountaintop
 2 But in reality, there are differences in what stakeholders want.
  Mr. A wants G1 at the top of the mountain and Mr. B wants G2 in the middle of the mountain.
  Mr. B tried to cooperate, thinking that G2 in the middle of the mountain would be achieved on the way to the summit.
 3 However, Mr. A was considering a route that did not go through G2
  3:1 That route is not in Mr. B's interest.
   Mr. B is neutral to Mr. A's plan
   There is no incentive to cooperate.
   In this case, we might cooperate with them with another incentive.
  3:2 That route appears impassable to Mr. B.
   To Mr. B, Mr. A's plan looks unfeasible.
   In this case, Mr. B has an incentive to convince Mr. A to change his route.
  3:3 Mr. B's cooperation is needed to pass that route
   There is no incentive for Mr. B to cooperate.
