Let's bug the humans.
A [sensor] that cannot measure correctly is not useful.
　Buggy sensors need repair.

I see humans as a metaphor for sensors.
　What does it mean for a human being to be "[buggy]"?
　Here, "to estimate that an event that occurs with probability p in reality occurs with a probability greater or less than p."

Let's bug everyone more.
	I was going to say "buggy people are less valuable."
	but there is absolutely no basis for it.
	On the contrary, I've always felt that buggy people make a more beneficial contribution to the advancement of civilization.
	→Let's bugger it up.

for some reason
　If everyone guesses the probabilities correctly and takes the same option, no search is done.
　Mistaking a low probability of success for a high probability of success [individuals who engage in high-risk behavior are necessary for the public good].

But if the reason it is better to have a variance in judgment is because of the need for exploration, i.e., you can't estimate accurately without exploration, so if you can really estimate accurately, shouldn't you have a variance?
	In other words, the conclusion is that humans are buggy and should be made more buggy!

relevance
　[human bug].
　[Rebalancing to emotion]
	It is beneficial that [people have personalities
	　Even if the sensor returns an accurate value, if the perception of "what is of value" is varied, the behavior chosen will be varied.
