 *1320994184*Suspect that the optional argument fill in matplotlib.patches.Circle is not working
 Even though fill=False in the code below, the "blue painted circle" is drawn.

 from matplotlib.collections import PatchCollection
 from pylab import *
 def draw():
     clf()
     circles = [Circle(random(2), radius=random(), fill=False)]
     gca().add_collection(PatchCollection(circles))
     matplotlib.pyplot.savefig('test.png')

 numpy.__version__ã€€== '1.6.1'
 matplotlib.__version__ == '1.0.1'
 
 I followed the pdb step by step execution and got into the built-in method draw_path_collection of matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.RendererAgg, so I got into trouble there.

 (Pdb) print renderer

 In conclusion, FILL is working.
 It seems to have been filled in gca().add_collection(PatchCollection(circles)).
 gca().add_collection(PatchCollection(circles, facecolor='none')) will not fill.

 Based on this comment, I looked into it and found that PatchCollection overrides the color specified by Circle by default.

 Definition:PatchCollection(self, patches, match_original=False, **kwargs)
 (snip)    
     *match_original*
         If True, use the colors and linewidths of the original
         patches.  If False, new colors may be assigned by
         providing the standard collection arguments, facecolor,
         edgecolor, linewidths, norm or cmap.
