Talking about the need for care for people who see strong people on social networking sites and lose motivation.

Is it necessary?
　Doesn't that mean that misconceptions will be corrected?
　　I doubt if it's appropriate in the long run to put it in the [greenhouse] for goodness sake and take away the opportunity to fix it.
　　We can't stay with that child for the rest of his/her life, we have to live with this social networking age for decades to come.
　Create opportunities to develop a [mountain is plural] mindset.

People who are put off by "stronger people doing X" don't want to "do X," they just want a strong image of themselves doing X.
