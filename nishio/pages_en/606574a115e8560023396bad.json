　Revisions and considerations for this task should be written down as they may be useful later
　This task is "relevant" because it occurred while the original task was being processed.
　On the other hand, it doesn't have much to do with the purpose of the original task, etc.
　　If it is written on the page of the original task, the topic is long overdue.
　　→ put it on a separate page
