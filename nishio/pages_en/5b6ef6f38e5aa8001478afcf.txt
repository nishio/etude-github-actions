	I proposed the concept of [leverage memo].
	I read this book and started making leverage memo in text file since 2009-03-06
 This is my summary of the book:.
  >80% of the content of a text is in 20% of the text; take 80% in 20% of the time, leverage notes and discard the original. Read it repeatedly and enrich it further.

	We are promoting [a lot of reading] of business books, but we didn't incorporate that.
  Already an engineer at the time, he disregarded business books because he felt they were less substantial than technical books.
  Sipping a lot of porridge does not strengthen the chin.
