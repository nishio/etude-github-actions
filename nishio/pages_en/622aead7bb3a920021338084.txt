Old-age behavior is interpersonal behavior.

Is senile behavior interpersonal behavior?
Can I say that [old behavior] is [interpersonal behavior]?
　Sounds good, but I'm not convinced yet.
　Because it's not interpersonal behavior, i.e., if you're doing it alone, you're not "harming" anyone else.
　No, not really.
　He may not intend interpersonal behavior.
　The person is acting against the world, and the action may harm another person contrary to the person's intentions.
　For example, feeding pigeons.
　　He thinks he is doing something good.
　　This causes the neighbors to suffer from pigeon poop damage.
　But this doesn't sound like much of an old man.
　If you tell them, "I have a problem with poo," and they don't change their behavior, you sound like an old man.
　It's still [interpersonal] behavior in this instance.
