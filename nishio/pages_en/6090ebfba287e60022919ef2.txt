 *1227945442*Insert latest vim with +python
 1: sudo port sync and wait a while as it takes time
 2: Make sure the port is up-to-date with port version
 3: sudo port install vim +huge +python
 
 **1227949333*Bitbucket and Dropbox
 Create a Dropbox account and add Bitbucket to it, since I was told not to put the repository in Dropbox.
 
 *1227952375*pyspa challenge 1st
 id:Voluntas asked me to create a pyspa challenge.
 
 >|python|
 print "".join(chr(ord(x) + 1) for x in *****)
 ||<
  Put the appropriate code in the ***** section so that it shows up as pyspa.
 
 
 I was told not to use chr or ord.
 >|python|
 import os
 print "".join(os.__doc__[x] for x in[os.__doc__.*****(x) for x in "pyspa"])
 ||<
 There are four ways, but it is the shortest.
 
 
 I've heard that it could be worse.
 >|python|
 import os
 os.system("python -m ***** | python -c 'import sys;(lambda x=sys.stdin.read():[sys.stdout.write(x[i]) for i in [67, 12, 31, 67, 36]])()'")
 ||<
 On Windows, it doesn't work well because if there is a space in the single quote, the argument is delimited there. When I am working in an interactive environment, os.system returns 0, so I get pyspa0.
 
 *1227958896*vim + Terminal.app + Grass + Courier16pt won't remove underlines
 MUU. Underlines remain when moving the cursor up.
 It disappears when I set the font size to 12pt. It disappears when I change the theme from Grass to Pro. I decided to use Osaka.
 
 *1227969992*vim training
 Head Hajikel.
 
 Use C-[ for Esc and C-h for BS.
 As long as you use the cursor keys, you will not get into the habit of "returning to command mode when you are done typing", so you should first add the following to your .vimrc
 >||
 noremap <Left> ""
 noremap <Right> ""
 noremap <Up> ""
 noremap <Down> ""
 ||<
 Write the
 
 To replace from a selection, V to move and s/foo/bar/g, y to copy (the opposite of Emacs!), p to paste. C-n for the Emacs equivalent of dynamic abbreviation completion; C-p to go back; p for paste; c for cut; C-n for the Emacs equivalent of dynamic abbreviation completion; C-p to go back; C-n for paste; C-n for paste; C-n for paste; C-n for paste.
 
 One line copy is Y or yy or Vy. there are many ways to do it.
 
 Ctrl is next to a of course, but Shift is supposed to be a thumb in KeyboardRemap.
