Selfish is an attribute of directed edges
 The term "[selfish]" is often taken as an individual [attribute].
  In terms of graphs, [vertex attributes].
 But isn't it really an attribute of the directed side?
 There is no such thing as a "selfish person to anyone" or a "[mutually beneficial] person to anyone."
 Each person has a "selfish treater" and a "mutually beneficial treater".

	PS
 	The "commune" is also an attribute of the "edges.
  Most people cannot distinguish whether it is an attribute of another person X or an attribute of the edge (self, X) because they cannot [objectively see themselves].
