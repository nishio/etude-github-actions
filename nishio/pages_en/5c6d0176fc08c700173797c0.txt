Associated with Scrapbox
	I wrote an article called [stock in associations].
	>[@rakusai https://twitter.com/rakusai/status/1095876131205464064] I think I finally got him to say the key words. Scrapbox stocks associations. It's a completely different way to expand the range of ideas.
	But then it occurred to me to search Twitter and see what I found.
	>[@kurubushi_rm https://twitter.com/kurubushi_rm/status/1039851342255206400] Certainly [Scrapbox] seems to suit people like myself who have suffered from [rough associations].
	>You might say that [network-type organization] is an organization that preserves the associations (connections) that information has in its original form. ([Scrapbox Information Organization] p.88)
	Various people mentioned it in various expressions.
