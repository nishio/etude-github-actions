 [Intellectual production is not stoicism.
 　When you want to use all your brain energy for intellectual production
 　If there's extra work to be done, that's where the energy is taken up and you're not at your best.
 　[When one is pushing the limits of one's intellect, the least burdensome method is chosen].
 　　For example, I usually write equations in TeX, but when it comes to really difficult topics, I don't have the brain resources to devote to TeX, so I write by hand.
 　　[/nishio/Information-Geometric Optimization].
　　　Another common direction is the "it's not good to devote resources to creating beautiful documents" kind of talk.
　　　Well, for those who are not good at keyboarding, Scrapbox seems to be a burden[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
　　　　In fact, "What you're missing is not a good note-taking tool, but an improvement in your typing speed." I'm sure there are people who are like that[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　　I started to write [/kozaneba-forum-jp/line-drawing-function] in a "is-tasu" style, but halfway through I was forced to write in a "da-da-are" style in fragments.
　　　 Well, I'll clean it up.
 　When someone teaches "intellectual production techniques" with a lot of "you have to" rules attached to them, it makes me think, "Hasn't this person ever really done any intellectual production themselves? I get the feeling that "this person has never done any real intellectual production himself.
