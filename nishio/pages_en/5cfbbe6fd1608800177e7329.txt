Memo
	[End design].
		Derivation to "[allow] questions to create command buttons."
		[conversation log 2021-01-30].
			I think the endgame of this one is probably that after the mode transitions to asking about relationships between symbols because it has a lot of keywords and considers them developed enough, it runs out of high scoring words, but it's still in the asking about relationships mode.
   Perhaps judging it from the distribution of keyword scores,
   I propose an end.
   Propose a new chat.
   Return to search mode
   I think it would be appropriate to do one of the following
	[Question naturalness dataset]
	　The amount of features should be improved.
 	Related: [Tuning a question that takes two arguments].
 		Do not repeat symmetrical questions: done
 		Need to collect naturalness for questions that take two arguments as well.
 	Related: [good and bad feedback during conversation].
 		NG feedback is used as training data
 		→ Not enough data and poor quality as training data.
 		　I think I'd be better off teaching through active learning.
	---
	[One-click import to Regroup].
　[IGNORE file to exclude from analysis those that are not appropriate for the target].
　(e.g., logs that are not being used properly)
　[Feedback button: like]
	Do not tamper with the score to represent the subject of interest.
　This is causing confusion between "what is actually repeated in the user's statement" and "what the system determines to be noteworthy".
　[Score=development, not attention].
	[If we were to create a task-organizing version of a listening chat system, we would...]
　In response to the input "Tsu, Tsuyoshi".
　　Not selected as a keyword because "strong" is an adjective.
　　　"What kind of "tough" is that "tough"?" is an ant question, so you might want to extract it.
　　The "つ" can be a noun, so it is included in the keywords.
　　The result is that you end up asking "one" digging question.
　Play keywords that are not good.
　　The CUI version had.
　　Turn it off when you make the Mattermost version and keep it off.
　　Use NGKW feedback to learn!
　　→There are quite a few cases where users are unaware of NGKW even though it's a good keyword, and learning from users makes you a fool.
　　　I put it in the form of putting only the obvious no-no's on the list.
	What we want to feedback
		Keyword extraction is not the first step.
			>You're starting to buy into the subtlety of it.
   >Where is that w?
   NGKW command.
		NG keywords selected for input
			Example: The
				[midday sun]
			Keyword extraction is fine, but not in the direction the user wants to drill down
				I hope you can say, "No, not that way," because this might not be something you can learn about in advance.
				It was realized in the form of the NGKW and UPKW commands.
		Not a good combination of keywords and questions chosen.
			NG feedback is used as training data
	[Symbol relationship is the same].
		>If the answer is that the relationship between two symbols is identical, it's not a good idea to ask questions about the relationship between symbols.
		Wouldn't it be nice if a button appeared that said "same" and when you pressed it, the two keywords were merged as a command?
		　I'll test it properly, because I'm afraid that the disappearance of one of the keywords might cause some bug.
	State Transition Mechanism
		How should state transition diagrams be maintained?
		How to soften it up.
		Beliefs about the state
			[Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes]
		[Conversation Log: State Transitions]
			Isn't it bad that the score you have for each word is one-dimensional to begin with? That's what I'm talking about.
				[Score=development, not attention].
		[Note: Keyword and question selection is intratumoral].
		Described by a relatively small number of parameters
   I want to make the BETTER indicators as good as possible while adhering to the MUST constraints.
   parameter search
   The large number of variations in the choice of questions (all of which must appear at least once) is also a constraint.
	[Order of appearance of the five basic questions].
	Include attenuation in cumulative score calculation?
	　Wouldn't it be better to add attenuation? I've wondered about that.
	　On the other hand, if you're responding well to the first "What do you hope will happen in this dialogue?", I'm inclined to think that you might want to remind me of the key words there from time to time.
	　　Often we observe cases where the first answer on this is messy.
	　　It's quite common for people to get more organized as they talk and it becomes clearer what they were looking for, so don't put too much emphasis on the first statement...
	[write_learning_pair]
 	Hypothesis that questions that provoke long user input are good questions
	[Questions that do not take keywords should take features from env].
	[No means of recovery if keywords are split.]
　[Judgment of Awareness]
　[Early design]
  Someone is making utterances that do not contain keywords on the first move. Now I'm asking questions without keywords anyway to avoid errors, but I might as well direct them to help since they don't seem to understand how to use it in the first place.
  　There are cases where people don't understand "digging for keywords," and there are cases where people want to bully the program.
  　Maybe we could [terminate the conversation from the program's side].
  If you cut too much with NGKW before the keywords are developed, the "fountain has dried up".
 　　Maybe we are in a vicious cycle of using NGKW so much that the keywords are depleted, the program jumps to a keyword from the most recent statement and asks a question, which is off the main topic, so it is NGKWed again.
 　　How can we successfully lead them to the state of being crowded with lots of keywords?
 　　Show the percentage of the value to be achieved in each phase?
 　　Point out that there are too few keywords and the pace of NGKW is too fast?
 　　　We could make it so that when there are few keywords, you have to wait a bit before you can press the button.
 　　　[good night].
　It would be nice if questions could specify some of the answers.
　　Is it the same? No?" displays the "Same" button
　　　When selected, it functions as a merge command for keywords.
　　Is this a good place to end?" should be "yes" or "no".
　　　That selection can be used directly for training data.
　[ppoi]
　　Read back and update
　Add a RAKE-like element to keyword extraction
　　Extract long sequences that appear in your own past statements/past logs/Scrapbox
