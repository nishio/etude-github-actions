Keicho Usage Techniques
While it is preferable to be able to use stationery without having to explain a lot, it is also common for people who are familiar with the mechanics of the stationery to use it in special ways to bring out its value, and it is probably better to verbalize such uses more and more.

		>[nisbot.icon]What "fragment" is that "fragment"?
 	>[nishio.icon](This is digging too deep into something that is not the main topic.)
	 >[nishio.icon]You can experiment with the arrangement of the icons by dragging them.
	 I want you to ask about "drugs," but you're asking about "fragments."
	 You ask yourself, "What is the relationship between drugs and fragments?" and you're shifting the focus of the bot by asking yourself the question, "What is the relationship between drugs and fragments?" and giving an answer that includes "drugs" and doesn't include "fragments.
	 This [- insider's crime] is a technique that Keicho came up with because he's someone who knows that "keywords that appear a lot are important, so dig in" behavior.
	 　It looks like someone who only reads the regular commentary can't get to it.
	 　Even if you include drag as a keyword, you might answer, "Fragments that can be arranged by trial and error by dragging.
	 　　This would raise the score because "fragments" would appear, and of course there would be questions to dig into the "fragments" again.

　　When you want to do a comparison of two objects, Keicho doesn't know there are two, so he digs into only one of them
　　I'm digging down on one side enough to reach awareness on that branch and then I'm letting it die 🙁 NG.
　　Using 👎NGKW would have been more immediate, but I avoided that because it would have been like cutting off a branch. In this case, I might as well have cut them off.
　　　That you avoided truncating it because you might realize after the fact that "you think they're two unrelated branches, but they're actually related."
　　　In this case, the two branches had nothing to do with each other, so I'm thinking "I should have cut them off," but hindsight bias.
　　To disclose the internal situation regarding this decision as well, NG will reduce the keyword score by 20%, and NGKW will be removed from the keyword candidates.
　　　Removing it from the candidate list means that it has not appeared at all in the past, which is a more severe treatment than having a score of zero.
　　　　The assumed use case is the treatment of something like the "W" in "seriously w" has been chosen as a keyword.
　　　This was abused more than expected, and many people cut it off and wiped it out before the branch developed, so we added a mildly effective command that could be abused.
