	golden stamp (archeol)
		Early on, it was mistakenly thought to be addressed to Ito Country.
		The name of the person who first claimed it was a fake was also written in the museum, and I thought that in a field where verification of authenticity is not easy and everyone is dead by the time it is settled, there is an incentive to keep the name by going against the grain.
		Japanese gold seals have a snake handle, but in some countries they have a tortoise handle, which my wife says is cuter.
	Interesting Mongolian sign face.
	I was made to carry home in my bag a sample I had made at the "cut and seal" experience corner, and I felt like a secret messenger.
	Ashikaga Shogun's seal is lovely in round letters.
