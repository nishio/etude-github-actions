partial access right
In the days when information was handled in paper documents, there were two choices: "show the whole paper" or "don't show the whole paper.

When information is handled digitally, partial [access rights] can be set. For example, only the name and address portion of a document with the name and address on it can be hidden, while the rest can be shared.

By hiding only "what not to show," and sharing the rest, [the distribution of information] becomes smoother.
