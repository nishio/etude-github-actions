 **1294934541*About Leverage Memo
 >>
 It turns out that the last time the leverage memo in my notebook was updated was last February. The update cycle had been going on for a while, so why did it stop? It was because too much information to put in a notebook was crammed between the narrow lines, making the text difficult to read. Cramming into a closet is not tidying up.

 What should be in paper form should be busted out, and the reason why this is not possible is because of anxiety about erasing. Then the main source should be held in digital data. And the notes should be readable on an iPhone or other device with simple operations. It is necessary to design the system so that when the brain is hungry for information in the spare time, it prefers to look at this instead of Twitter.

 Actually, I have already created a service that allows version control of leverage memos so that they can be scraped without worry, and I have published it with only myself as the only account holder, but I haven't used it for a while because I can't get the review cycle to work. I guess it's not good enough that the reviews only work on my computer.

 Posting can be done without a source. Multiple items can be listed as the source later. Stress-free use with intermittent Internet access, such as when traveling by train. The appropriate interface will vary from person to person, so the API should be open to the public to give users the freedom to create their own interface. The review should be an intellectually fulfilling time.
