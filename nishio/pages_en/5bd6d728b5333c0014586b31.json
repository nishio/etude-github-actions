Swipe to adjust distance
# want to do

I made it.
	[draws near and reads]
	The amount of movement was not taken because it was picked up by the swipe Up/Down decision.
	The swipe is uncomfortable to operate as it pops closer with the completed frame.

-----
	In slow swiping, the amount of change depends on the amount of swiping
 Much larger change for quick swipes
 For things that have changed
 	Do not approach within a certain distance (equivalent to maximum display within visual field)
  Round only when the distance after the move crosses a multiple of the initial value from smaller to larger.

with this
	Fast front swipe for maximum display
 Fast back swipe to initial distance
indicates uncertainty or second hand nature of what precedes it
