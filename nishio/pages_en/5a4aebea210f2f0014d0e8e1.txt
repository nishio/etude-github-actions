Situated in Suchman
The author says that the "plan" model of human-machine interaction that artificial intelligence research assumes is always doomed to fail somewhere because it does not take into account the characteristic that human social behavior is "embedded in [a] situation. This book reveals this through a detailed "[conversation analysis]" of the process in which a "smart" copy machine that incorporates artificial intelligence functions fails in "[communication]" with its novice users and goes bankrupt. This book provides a thorough analysis of human-machine communication in a high-tech society, based on ethnomethodological studies of everyday conversation, revealing its possibilities and limitations."
