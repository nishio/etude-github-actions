Why is the cursor altering itself?
 (derail)I often wonder why [/villagepump/nishio.icon]'s cursor is splitting up? [/villagepump/takker.icon].
　　Smartphone and PC[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
  I see[/villagepump/takker.icon].
   You have both open.
  I'm practicing [thumb shift] on my PC and my Japanese input speed is slowing down, so I'm using my phone's [flick input is faster].
  　But the ones that involve multiple line selections, such as "Let's link a line to this page and quote this range," are difficult to do on a smartphone, so I do them on a PC.
  　Apple products share the clipboard with each other, so it's like a physical multiple-screen, multiple-input device.
  　　The browser screen you are viewing is also shared.
