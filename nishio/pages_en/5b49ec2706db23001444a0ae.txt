Leverage memo review system
 #intellitech introduced me to a failed project I made a long time ago.
 What would you do if you had to rebuild it now?
 I like the spacing iterative approach of [Incremental Reading] very well.
  In other words, without explicitly deleting things that have no value, they disappear naturally.
 I also like the way [Scrapbox] is connected.
  If you mark keyword X on one page and the same keyword X on another page, both pages will link to each other
 Neither is satisfactory on its own.
 The ease of the excerpt itself is important.
  I don't want to write down every single source.
  It is important to be able to trace the original source later.
 Fusion with whole mind system?
  Synergy is strong, if not mandatory.
