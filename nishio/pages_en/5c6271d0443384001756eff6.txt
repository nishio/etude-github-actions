semilachis
	[Semilattice - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilattice]
	Half of [lattice], [semi-lattice].
	Structure formed by [inclusion relation] of [set

	If the set is as shown in the upper left diagram, drawing a line through the inclusion relationship such as "A encompasses B" will result in the upper right diagram. [Tree].
	In reality, however, there are relationships where "one does not encompass the other, but neither is it unrelated," as in B and C in the figure below left.
	If we draw this in a diagram with inclusions, we get the lower right figure. In this figure, B and C meet at E.
	This is not a tree. Such a structure is called [semilattice].

	In other words [that "inclusion" and "irrelevance" are not two choices].
