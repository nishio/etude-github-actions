Please press the "Good", "Bad", and "Want to try" buttons in the [nisbot.icon] input field.
[nishio.icon]Good things
[nisbot.icon]What good things have happened?
[nishio.icon]The creation of a purpose-specific mode has made it easier to visualize how to use the system.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "purpose-specific mode" is that "purpose-specific mode"?
[nishio.icon]Writing Support and Reflection Support
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "writing assistance" is that?
[nishio.icon]The bad.
[nisbot.icon]What bad things have happened?
[nishio.icon] Sprouting references from existing code to modules in add mode, so every time you add something, you have to go around and add that reference.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in such a situation?
Add a [nishio.icon]specialized mode module and write one line and hope it's nice and incorporated.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "add" is that "add"?
The [nishio.icon] specialized mode usually fits in one file, so it's like writing that. Now I have to write it and then modify it to call it from a file here and there.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "specialized mode" is that?
[nishio.icon] that adds a different question or command than the default one.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "add"?
[nishio.icon]Now, the code in each part of the body calls the specialized mode individually, and the specialized mode adds questions and commands, so each part is now required to know "what specialized mode is available".
[nisbot.icon]What "command" is that "command"?
[nishio.icon]Things to try
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to try?
Introduce a mediator to manage the [nishio.icon] specialization mode.
[nisbot.icon]What happens next when you do that?
[nishio.icon] Each part can call the mediator, so you don't have to edit when you add a new specialized mode.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "add"?
