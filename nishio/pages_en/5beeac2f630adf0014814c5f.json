Distributed representation of books
	[Distributed representation of letters], [Distributed representation of words], [Distributed representation of sentences].
 	I was thinking about it, and it seemed natural that books would have their own [distributed representation].
 A distributed representation of a book is of course different from a "distributed representation of the title of a book as a short sentence"
 	Often the book's content and title do not match.
	The book has a table of contents and a set of short sentences called chapter titles
 	There is of course a "[chapter variance expression]" that is separate from the variance expression in this chapter title.
 Books are often referred to as "p.XX in book XX
 	Of course, there's also "[Page Distributed Representation]."

	The mechanism that takes [distributed representation of book title] as input and returns [distributed representation of book content] is the [Attention Mechanism

	For example, I have done [the KJ method] with book covers as sticky notes
 	[Clean space + KJ method experiment]
		This "sticky note position" is a two-dimensional vector
  It is possible to mix this with a distributed representation: [merge distributed representation].
  [Is rotational neglect appropriate?"]
