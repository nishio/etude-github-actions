Differential backup of mics with rsync
Backing up by copying the entire file is inefficient because the same file is copied over and over again.
Hard link unmodified files with rsync
	The "--link-dest" option for differential backups with [rsync: Command Technica - ITmedia Enterprise https://www.itmedia.co.jp/enterprise/articles/0804/25/news 034.html]

While normal backups copy all visited regions, this method saves space and speeds up the process by copying only the regions that have been updated.

	Python.
	`--exclude-from=FILE     read exclude patterns from FILE`

code:bash
 rsync -a --delete --link-dest=../`ls | grep "backup" | tail -n1` minecraft_server backup`TZ=Asia/Tokyo date +%Y%m%d_%H%M`

解説
	backup`TZ=Asia/Tokyo date +%Y%m%d_%H%M`
		Create a file name like `backup20211025_1624` based on the current time.
	`ls | grep "backup" | tail -n1`
	　Get the last filename containing BACKUP


Note on rsync options
code::
	-a, --archive               archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)
	-r, --recursive             recurse into directories
 -l, --links                 copy symlinks as symlinks
 -p, --perms                 preserve permissions
 -t, --times                 preserve modification times
 -g, --group                 preserve group
 -o, --owner                 preserve owner (super-user only)
 -D                          same as --devices --specials
     --devices               preserve device files (super-user only)
     --specials              preserve special files

Python script I was using before I made the difference
code:python
 import shutil
 from datetime import datetime 
 
 IGNORE = """
 .git
 jdk*
 *.jar
 logs
 block-backups
 .archive-unpack
 *.tar
 """.strip().splitlines()
 
 now = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M")
 
 shutil.copytree(
     "minecraft_server", 
     f"backup{now}",
     ignore=shutil.ignore_patterns(*IGNORE),
 )
