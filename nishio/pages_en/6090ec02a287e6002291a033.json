 *1257477721*LinkShareI'm not sure.
 On the LinkShare application screen, the only choices for advertisers are US, Canada, and UK, so I thought that's how it was supposed to be, but it seems to be determined by the browser language settings. I thought that was the case, but it seems that the language setting is determined by the browser's language setting. I had no choice but to create a Japanese account.
 
 But I wonder. How can one person have only one website, and why are sites and accounts designed as one-to-one?
 
 *1257525585* Do something on an ongoing basis.
 I think it's great when people can "do something on an ongoing basis." Like doing just one iKnow dictation every day.
 
 I had to go through dictation on iKnow for the first time in a month or so until I got to 100%. And after the second round, you get a good grade and a sense of satisfaction because you've remembered it. I don't know how to motivate the behavior of doing one every day.
 
 Well, it is better to do it continuously, of course, but it is better to do it than not to do it.
 
 Why not attach Sunshine Ranch to iKnow? You can get a gift every day when you access the site for the first time. Also, if your friends put a "Do you understand this?" mark on a question and you solve it, you get 1.5 times as many coins.
 
 But rewarding people with pseudo-currency for accomplishing tasks is called a token economy, and it is actually a method used in behavioral therapy.
 
 I wonder if iKnow will also incorporate expressions like "English savings" can be saved by studying English or something like that.
