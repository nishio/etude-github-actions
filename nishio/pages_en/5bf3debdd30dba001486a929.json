Embedded Vector Extension
	Suppose the label is embedded in a 200-dimensional space.
 Suppose a human places a portion of that label on a two-dimensional space ([electronic KJ method tool]).
 Is there a way to put this information to good use?
Extension of [Embedded Vector

---
If you want to merge a 200 dimensional [dispersion representation] with a 200 dimensional dispersion representation created by some other method, I guess you could make it 400 dimensional and then drop it down to 200 dimensional by [PCA], but what if you want to add something manually added by humans using the KJ method or something - I don't want that axis rewritten. Hey, I'm thinking.

I wonder if this is a different kind of problem when using the KJ method, since not all rows have hand-added data to begin with.

Given that humans don't input the positions of all labels, the [missing value] process that "infers the 2D vector from the 200-dimensional embedded vector and the few 2D vectors input by the human for those for which the human did not input a 2D vector"?

Sort by: [missing value].

When the missing value process is able to infer the 2D vector without error by [linear regression], the additional two dimensions are [linearly dependent] on the remaining dimensions. If PCA is applied, the missing value process will be reduced without error.
