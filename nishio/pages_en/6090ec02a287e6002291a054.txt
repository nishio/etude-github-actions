 *1263366355* Day 2 of the 51st Prosin Diary
 I used to blog all over the place with fragmented notes, but since time has caught up with me in the form of Twitter, I no longer have anything to blog about. Hmmm.

 My presentation is coming soon. I'm so nervous. Things to keep in mind:
 -Disconnect wireless LAN
 -I'll talk calmly.
 -Turn the stopwatch (I set the timer on my iPhone to use it in the summer and it made a sound even though I had it on silent mode.)
 -I'm not going to make up some lame excuse.
