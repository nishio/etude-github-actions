Starting a business is filling a hole.
[Hideto Fujino] says that many people think of [entrepreneurship] as building a tall [tower] in the middle of nowhere, but he found a big [hole] in the ground and tried to fill it. #Parable.

>I believe that creating a new business is "finding a hole and filling it. In other words, discovering a social issue and implementing it.
>People within the industry don't notice the old holes because they are visible in the landscape. People outside the industry may see a hole, but they don't know how to fill it. I founded my company because I saw a huge hole in the 100 trillion yen market and thought I could fill it.
