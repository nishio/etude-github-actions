Pareto distribution
probability density function
[$ \frac{a/b}{(x/b)^{a+1}}]
	When b=1
	[$ \frac{a}{x^{a+1}}]
		Taking the logarithm [$ \log(p(x)) = \log(a) - (a+1)\log x]
			[both logarithmic graphs] to be a straight line
	expected value
		[$ \frac{ab}{a - 1}] (a > 1)
		No convergence of expected values when a=1

	[Power law]
	[Zipf rule]
		The kth most frequent element in terms of frequency of occurrence is proportional to 1/k
		This is because the domain of definition is discrete
		Proportional to 1/k" corresponds to a=0, but in this case, the sum does not converge.
