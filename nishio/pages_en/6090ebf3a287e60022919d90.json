 I'm talking about this one, but if you look at the source code, on line 16
 
 var pruefstring = 'great look along miss must more...
 
 What does it say? So I wonder if I can replace this part and type in any word I want, like function or getElementById, I think it would be amachang god speed.
 
 ATOK++ that was able to convert Godspeed
 
 *1195804647*water blister
 Oh, I'm getting blisters on my lips...
 
 *1195812763*Monad in Python
 Oh wow, I was thinking of writing about it sometime! Wonderful!

 Is this how we should do the series list?

 Both the imperative writing and the functional types use Python. This is a great way to dispel the "monads are Haskell-specific" misconception.

 *1195829970* Definition of PEG by PEG
 http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/popl04/peg-popl04.pdf
 
 On the second page is the definition of PEG by PEG.
 
 But Sequence can be empty, or Surfix contains the body, or something like that, I don't like it, so I rewrote it while referring to it.
