imposter syndrome

An Imposter is a "con artist". It is the feeling that one is not being evaluated on one's merit and that one is unknowingly committing fraudulent acts.
Although named "syndrome," the subject later came to believe that "imposter experience" would have been more appropriate. The word has a strong impact and stands alone.

The opposite state of [unfounded confidence]. Despite the fact that there are achievements that are well-founded and that are appreciated by others, the state of self-doubt is caused by the perception that "it is because I am deceiving them".

It may be a phenomenon that if in the past you have perceived someone who is rated higher than his/her ability as a fraud, the criticism will be directed at you at the time when you are rated higher.
