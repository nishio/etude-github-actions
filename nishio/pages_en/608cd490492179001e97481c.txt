Hypothesis testing lead time
>[hiroki_daichi https://twitter.com/hiroki_daichi/status/1388253385065852928]: Principles such as Agile are often explained in relation to "speed and agility" because of the meaning of the word, which makes them difficult to understand. The key principle in software development is "Fail-Fast", and the principle of static typing, automated testing, chaos engineering, scrum development, and product management is to "[fail] early".

>[hiroki_daichi https://twitter.com/hiroki_daichi/status/1388253386982580226]: if you are associated with speed, you may lean toward "make it in a hurry" or "make it with no time to spare". To fail early, it becomes hypothesis-testing lead-time thinking. Thinking to identify what is the most volatile risk is required.

If the method of making C from B is not clear, then the work will be meaningless if the process does not go as planned between A and B. The feeling of "I'm not sure how to make B from A.

We need to identify which is the weakest arrow in the arrow connection and make a prototype to check if it is not broken. If it's broken, it's in our best interest to notice it as soon as possible. This is what I mean by "it pays to fail fast."

I'm not doing anything, tell me what you did", it is easier to give feedback if you say "I thought it would be good to do this, but the result was different from what I expected.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1388420063196172290]: "Summer homework, if you do it from what you're good at, you're left with the things you're not good at, and that's a bit depressing. The analogy of "it's better to do it from what you are not good at first" is good for the atmosphere, but there is no dependency between the tasks. If you put off the free research you're not good at and don't finish it during summer vacation, it doesn't invalidate the kanji drills you're good at that you did first twitter.com/hiroki_daichi/...

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1388421026430685191]: when the arrows are in series, like "make B from A and C from B", if one arrow is broken, the whole thing is ruined. So you need to check the weakest arrow first.
