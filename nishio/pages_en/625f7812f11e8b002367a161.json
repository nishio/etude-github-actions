Train travel is a forced time box
I had to go somewhere for the first time in several months, so I took the train.
During the train ride, I did a task that I could do with books and my phone, and I made great progress. It's the effect of the [timebox].

It is a task that can be measured by quantity, a task that is easy to interrupt when the train arrives at the station because it is a collection of smaller units.
The task as a whole tends to be daunting because it is a large task, but the size of the task is clear if it is to be carried out in the time available for train travel.

It's one of the things that has changed since I stopped commuting in [COVID19].
Tasks that were good enough to do while commuting to work were consumed daily and did not accumulate a lot when I was commuting to work every day.

The length of time spent in a restaurant waiting for an order to be placed and served is unclear.
ã€€It can perform the chopped-down tasks, but it doesn't seem to be as effective at focusing as a train.
