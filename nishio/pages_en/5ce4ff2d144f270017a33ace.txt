Python sections
	I found the introductory section on Python difficult to follow. I will wrestle with this, but if it doesn’t become clear, I’ll have to ask you to help me understand. This is why it is a good thing that I am not a programmer – you need people with no prior knowledge of Python to be able to understand the analogy.
