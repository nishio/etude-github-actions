Is parallel work right?
 Makes it difficult to concentrate on writing the program.
  Indeed!
  But [is it good to be focused?"].

 [Parallel work] allowed us to achieve unexpectedly high results in a finely fragmented amount of time.
  Profit is generated by satisfying unmet [demand].
   A gap exists and the process of closing it creates profit # Parable of the New Combination and the Surface of the Water
   There is a lot of unmet demand across [organizational boundaries].
   This generated unexpectedly high revenues.
  On the other hand, I'm certainly losing time to concentrate on writing programs.

 Is it right to do only easy and profitable tasks?
  Profit is a requirement for survival, not an objective.
  	Drucker: [Profit is a condition, not an objective, of an enterprise].

	We should aim for [maximizing learning], not maximizing profit.
 	This is just Nishio's personal ideology.
 	Why do you think so?

	First they do some sort of task X.
 Then do another kind of task y
 	If you don't like Task X and are escaping
  If challenged with the idea that Task Y should be learned
  The latter view is healthier.
  But it is impossible to identify which one it is. Even he may be fooling himself.
 What if this task Y is unexpectedly profitable?

	[that no longer functions must be discarded].
		If the goal is to generate revenue, it "works" while revenue is being generated, so just keep going.
  If the goal is to learn, even if it is profitable, it should be discarded when it becomes "it takes up time, but no learning is gained".
  In the end, it comes down to how you set your objectives.
