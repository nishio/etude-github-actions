	Most of what I wrote was summarized in [auto-bracketing
	What is not written

	[I want to bracket local files.]
	[Bracketing for uneditable items].
	For example, for a cut and scanned PDF, it would be nice to have the metadata for that file.
	Similarly for images...

	I've thought this far and realized that the meaning has expanded from the original meaning of "[bracketing]"
	Competition/Inherent Bracketing is to bracket a portion of editable text to make it a "link" and create the possibility of future merging
	The broad usage here is focused on "[increasing] the likelihood of bonding"
		In other words, you want to increase the [possibility of merging] for local files as well as for those placed in Scrapbox.

	Intrinsically important from a UX perspective to be presented at a sufficient speed
