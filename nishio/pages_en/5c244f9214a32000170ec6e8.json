Amount of reading is an indicator of vanity
The amount of reading is [an indicator of vanity], although it is often observed that people are proud of [the amount of reading].
It is not the amount of books read, but how the knowledge gained from the books is used and what kind of [value] is created.

If you see people who are not value-producing and are proud of the amount of reading they do, you can just think "that's lame" and go through with it, but people who are not confident in themselves are influenced and feel impatient. Even if they read fast or read a lot in a hurry, it is meaningless if it does not lead to action.

We have to go at our own pace, step by step.
