(4.1.1.2) Is the purpose to obtain information?
In the case of non-entertaining reading, many people think that the purpose of reading books is to get new information. Let's think deeply about getting information.

Human beings build a model in the brain by repeatedly abstracting from the concrete information that they experienced. We cannot put a model of another person directly into our brain.

It is because we do not have the hardware to transfer models in our brain.

Strictly, at least for the present human beings do not have. We can not deny the possibility that we expand our input/output with an invention in the future.
