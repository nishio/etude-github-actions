	The DJI people showed me this at [Unexplored Junior Shenzhen Tour 2019] and I thought it was great!

	Assembled by Cybozu and run on the 27th floor.
		I got the video taken and I'll edit it later and put it on YouTube.

	I'm an adult and it's like 3-4 hours.
	Q: Is there an omni wheel in the box? A: There are parts in the [mecanum hole] and you assemble it yourself.

To be exact, I was taking pictures of people who were assembling it while I was tweaking it (lol).
> It's pretty good and interesting. Maybe we can have a company competition or something? ðŸ˜…
> Also, I would like to connect this to CoderDojo activities that provide programming opportunities for children.
	Two cars against each other would be nice, but racing is also an option, just with the hallway as a lap course. https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1192680.html

	Tutorials for beginners
		This gets me excited from the very first tutorial for beginners!
			[https://gyazo.com/fda92192f3e68fbb3bbcf013c7f74417]
			If you get hit, turn in that direction and hit back.
		Evade by moving in a circle while aiming in the direction of the opponent
			This is a "write a program to get stronger" game.
			[https://gyazo.com/f3942b6690dd3003ebab0c6cf08a31c0]
		The tutorial continues with the operating principle of the mechanum wheel (force synthesis), a discussion of coordinate systems, PID control, and
		The line tracer was more stubborn than expected.
			[https://gyazo.com/2e029683e2073ddda17517b7d3434259]
			PID control of speed by calculating tangent angle
		Finally, the control is controlled by receiving instructions at the marker, aiming and shooting at the marker of the instructions.
		Q: For what age group? A: 14-ish.

		The camera on the main unit has a pretty wide-angle view, but my wife has requested that I not show the untidy part of the room, so I cropped out a part of it.

		He comes back a few times and sniffs it.

	The gel ball swelled up more than expected, the spilled ball was bouncy... hard to get by hand, so I collected it with a spoon.

		This is about as much as I got.

		It says 4 hours for water supply, but it doesn't take that long to inflate, so you should put it in a little bit of water first and see how much it inflates.
		Q: What is this? A: Bullets ejected by RoboMaster S1
		The FAQ said.
			>The recommended ratio is 500 gel bullets (roughly the volume of a bottle lid) to 1000 ml of water.

	I removed the speed limit for beginners.
 	Speed limits are on by default but can be removed.
 	3.5 meters per second forward, 2.5 meters per second backward

			I took this photo from above because there are many zones where photography is prohibited at home, but the angle of view is so narrow that it's hard to see the speed of the camera.
	 	I was about to explain that I might be too scared to give it my all because of the small space, when I realized that I should have made it an automatic operation instead of me controlling it.
