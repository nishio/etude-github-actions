Parable of the Spiral Staircase
The concept of "doing the same thing over and over again" and the concept of "moving forward without ever returning to where we left off" seem contradictory at first glance, but they can be integrated. That is the metaphor of the spiral staircase.

A spiral staircase, when viewed from above, is "going around the same place" or "repeating itself," but when viewed from the side, it is "climbing up.

Drucker: "History is circular. But the content is of a higher order."
