Re: (5.4.3-2) Scrapbox
The footnote in (5.4.3) mentions Scrapbox. We would like to develop this into a section.

Scrapbox is a kind of Wiki. It was invented by Toshiyuki Masui and is provided by Nota Inc.
I started using it in 2017 and as of 2019 there are 4000 pages in my public project (*1).
This English version (*2) is also available on Scrapbox.

The previous sections have introduced social triggers and triggers by interval; Scrapbox produces another trigger, which is the ability to create a new trigger, which is the ability to create a new trigger by interval, which is the ability to create a new trigger by interval, which is the ability to create a new trigger by interval.

One of the features of Scrapbox is the concept of "links. A simple notation can be used to express a link. This link can also, but is not limited to, expressing a connection from a sentence on a page to another page. The link can be created even if the page does not exist at this time. Concepts that may lead to something in the future or that would benefit from the creation of a page can be made into a link. This is a common feature of traditional wikis as well.

Scrapbox runs an ambiguity search against existing page titles and links when writing links. This absorbs some notational distortion and suggests connections to "concepts that I have found useful in the past that I hope to connect to in the future.

This link will also be expanded and displayed up to two hops ahead, even if there is no page to link to. This assists in the ability to find related articles in the past.

The triggering of this linkage by connecting is very beneficial.
