People who cannot tolerate the good fortune of others.
	It seems that one game had a bug that gave out a lot of good items only to a few people.
 I hear people who didn't get [lucky] are furious about it.
 My wife wondered why it happens so much when there's no loss.
 It's the [Fair World Hypothesis].
 There are many people in the world who believe that the world is [fair].
 Such people believe that good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.
 Therefore, if I am not rewarded, it is as if I am being told that I am evil, which is unacceptable.
