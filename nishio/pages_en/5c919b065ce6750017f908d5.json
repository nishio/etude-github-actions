The problem of the notebook being in the back of the bag
write later

Quantitative Means of Measurement
 Do you know where your notebook is?
 How many seconds does it take to get that out?

bad example
 My notebook is in my bag, it's hard to get it out because it's in the back of my bag because I shoved stuff in there later.
 Case in point.
  My notebook is on my desk.
  When you sit down, first take out your notebook, check it, and then put it on the desk.
  After getting ready to go home as well, I check my notebook one last time before putting it away.
  As a result, the notebook is always on your desk or in the most accessible place in your bag.
