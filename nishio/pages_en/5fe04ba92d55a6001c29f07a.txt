Sparse Tables and Segment Trees
[Sparse table] Construct O(NlogN), range query O(1), target not updatable
[Segment tree] update O(logN), range query O(logN)

Segment trees can be constructed on the same order as sparse tables by updating each value
ã€€I feel like I can make it O(N) by initializing them all together.

Segment tree range queries are certainly slower than sparse tables
	but after doing it N times, it finally catches up to the same level of order as the sparse table construction, so much so that
	If the query is Q times, there is no advantage to use sparse table only when the time constraint is OK for O(Q) and NG for O(QlogN).
		It's hard to create that kind of restriction in a contest where you can use a variety of languages.
