Incremental Reading
Reading methodology by the creator of SuperMemo, an interval repetition memory tool
	Put the text you want to read into the tool.
 While reading, excerpt the parts you find important (you can easily do this with shortcut keys).
 You may interrupt at any time.
 The interval iteration algorithm allows sentences to be presented at progressively longer intervals
 	Those that are not read because they are too difficult, or I tried to include them but they are boring, etc., will naturally disappear.
 Fragments that are small enough are rewritten into a quiz format
