Reading the air and dialectics
	>It follows that the intellectual evolution of the West has always been a dialectical development in this way. What is important here is the meaning of [criticism]. If you look at criticism of an opposing viewpoint only from your own perspective, it can be seen as either [belief] or [intolerance] (positive or negative), but from a third-party perspective, from a bird's eye view, in [dialectical history] it becomes justice (a good thing in principle) that leads to new ideas and advances humanity. It is a good thing in principle.
	>The reason why the nuance of "[reading the air]" is difficult for Westerners to understand is that this act of reading the air is based on the assumption that there is "no" clear [conflict structure].

Interesting assertion
	For the act of "reading the air" to be valid, there must be no clear conflict structure in place.
	In the West, where dialectical history is widespread, [conflict] is considered a good thing, and there are conflicts all over the place
 Therefore, "reading the air" is impossible in the first place and difficult to understand

relevance
	[No opposition exists.]
