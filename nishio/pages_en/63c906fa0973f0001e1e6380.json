　This is an interesting cut[/villagepump/nishio.icon].

 Capital does not trickle down because it can be stored indefinitely.
 Capitalists' [capital investment] to increase productive capacity increases capitalists' earnings in the short term.
 　but competition among capitalists will allow consumers to obtain goods at lower prices in the long run.
 　This causes trickle down.
 Digital tools have a very low cost of production, so the investment is not in "increasing production capacity" but in "producing higher quality
 　Lower human cost to provide high quality products to everyone than to produce high quality products and low quality products
 　So trickle down occurs.
 　　Really?
 　　　Why not just offer it only to those who pay enough?
 　　　Ah, so when there is competition between capitalists, the side with the trust that "what you offer is of higher quality" wins, so it is advantageous to offer advanced products at a [freemium] price.
 　　　　DeepL was able to win customers because it showed freemium that it could do more advanced translations than Google Translate.
