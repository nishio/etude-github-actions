[img2prompt]はVRAM消費24GB

A bug was discovered for images under seed 752.
　When I was reading multiple prompts from a file and generating them, I had to fix the seed for each prompt, but I only did it at the beginning.
　So, even if "seed=500" is recorded, that is "the state after several images are generated after seed is set to 500", so if seed=500 is set again, the same image will not appear
　I can manage if I try hard enough, but...
　　For example, after setting seed=500, you can draw several times until you get that image
　　Wife: "Not as hard as I try."
　Okay then.
　I was going to output the pattern of [Diary 2022-09-13] again in a size that could be used for a book cover or a hand towel, but I was puzzled because the image I was expecting did not appear.
　　Now that we can output cyclic images, I thought I'd do that as far as the hand towels are concerned.

Speeded up img2prompt to work in 2-3 seconds per case.
　638 img2prompt results were obtained
　Let's think about importing into Scrapbox in parallel with Instagram posts.

[Thompson sampling]
　The Bernoulli distribution is used to determine whether an image is "good" or "not good".
　Its conjugate prior distribution is a beta distribution
　Thompson sampling to select the largest one by sampling
　Sampling from a beta distribution can be done with numpy.random.beta
 Let's say there are two slots here, one slot per 5 draws and one slot per 30 draws.
  Although the latter is a greater expectation, the uncertainty of the former should be positively evaluated
  code:py
   In [245]: [0 if beta(2, 5) > beta(31, 71) else 1 for i in range(20)]
   Out[245]: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
 	The former was chosen 11 out of 20 times.
