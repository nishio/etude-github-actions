I made a PDF file.

 Since you can only write one word at a time, it is too small to carefully develop a single business model, but this is more compact and easier to use as a 1,000-knock exercise. I also made sure to leave enough white space so that I could write down anything that came to mind while I was writing the canvas. Without margins, you may have trouble finding a place to write down your thoughts, or you may not write them down at all. It would be counterproductive if the framework restricted the thinking.
