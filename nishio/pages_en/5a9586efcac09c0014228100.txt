Human Resources and Persimmons
 It seems that those [hunters] who think that human resources grow at random and are making do by harvesting them do not have the idea of cultivating [fruit trees] that produce [fruit] over a period of three years for a peach, three years for a chestnut, and eight years for a persimmon.
 [Bamboo shoots] don't grow by themselves, they grow because of the [underground stem].
  The rhizome is not visible
  We need to stretch the invisible underground stem [network].
