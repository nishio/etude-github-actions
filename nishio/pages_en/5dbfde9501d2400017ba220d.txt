	[nishio.icon]This is the difference between "[a race with a clear goal]" and "[a search without a goal]." The person who competes in a race grows faster with respect to the ability that can be measured in that race, but that alone does not allow him to decide his own path when he is placed in a situation without a goal. I never had the opportunity to experience that.

	>Should I train them or should I hold off on training them until they start doing it as spontaneously as possible?
	[nishio.icon]
		The solution differs between the perspective that considers the optimum for society as a whole and the perspective that parents consider the [local optimum] of their own children.
		As an example, in a situation where "society wants people who act spontaneously," "leave it to spontaneous action and ignore those who did not voluntarily train themselves" is rather close to [the overall optimum], but parents do not like their children to be ignored.
		Time is finite, and the amount of learning that can be achieved per hour is vastly different between those who are [motivated] to act voluntarily and those who are [unwillingly] ordered to act by their parents or schools.
			So, I take the position that it's important to be spontaneous.
			However, I think this may be because I don't have children....

The [society's overall optimum] and the [parent's local optimum] are different.
