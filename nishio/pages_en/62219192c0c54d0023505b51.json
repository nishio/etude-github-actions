Scope of private use
> â‘  Private use (Article 30, Paragraph 1, Pillar 1 of the Law)
> Private use means personal use or use within the family or other similarly limited scope, and reproduction is permitted regardless of the type of work, whether or not it has been published, as long as it is intended for private use.
> i) Here, the question is what exactly is meant by "within the limited scope of personal or family or other equivalent".
> 	...
> "In terms of the number of members, since it is equivalent to a family, there should normally be about 4 to 5 members, and the relationship among them should have a close and closed relationship equivalent to that of a family" (Report of the 5th Subcommittee of the Copyright Council (1981)). Therefore, it is understood that "a limited scope equivalent to this" means that, at a minimum, there must be a strong personal bond between the members, i.e., the number of members must be similar to that of a family and the group must be "specified".
