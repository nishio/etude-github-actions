 **1241249289*About Alkaloids for Relieving Fatigue
 I'm feeling somewhat fatigued, so I'm looking into alkaloids that are supposed to remove fatigue by interfering with the function of adenosine receptors (a braking mechanism) in the brain.
 
 
 It is slightly addictive but does not seem to be a concern. However, no ingredient has been found that can detoxify this alkaloid, so one should use appropriate doses with caution for acute intoxication. About half of a typical adult who ingests 6.5 mg/kg or more within one hour will develop acute symptoms, and all who ingest 17 mg/kg or more within three hours will develop acute symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms of acute poisoning include mental confusion, delusion, convulsions, and coma in severe cases. Physical symptoms include muscle spasms, pupil dilation, and respiratory paralysis. After ingestion, it takes 0.5 to 2 hours for the blood concentration to reach its maximum level, and the blood elimination half-life is 4.5 to 7 hours.
 
 
 While stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine excite the brain by promoting dopamine release in the excitatory (gas pedal) dopamine nervous system, these alkaloids excite the brain indirectly by interfering with the function of the inhibitory (brake) adenosine nervous system. For this reason, it is not strictly regulated and is exempted from the Japanese Methamphetamine Control Law. Since it is extracted from a plant suited to the climate near the equator, it is believed that developing countries near the equator cannot do without it as a means of obtaining foreign currency. It is distributed in various forms, from simply dried parts of the plant to a brownish powder or blackish-brown liquid from which the pharmacologically active ingredients are extracted and dried. This alkaloid has a strong bitterness that makes oral ingestion painful, but it is more often ingested orally at a reduced concentration that is more tolerable than injections or inhalation.

 What a thing to write over a cup of instant coffee.

 I have been wanting to write science fiction for a while now, but I am not good at describing people, so I can't write at all. I can write something like the entry I just wrote rather easily, but it is not fiction, because it does not contain any lies. Science Non-Fiction. Like <a href='http://www.komazawa-u.ac.jp/~kazov/Nis/etc/DHMO.html'>Let's oppose DHMO (Dihydrogen Monoxide)</a>.
