 *1284638475*Let's add a footnote feature to genko.
 I am writing a manuscript in <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20100911/1284167528'>a tool for writing magazine manuscripts in HTML</a>. I want to write footnotes in the body of the text, but when I look at it, I want to put (*) or something in the body of the text, and the body of the footnotes should be separate from the body of the text.
 >||
 <a class="footnote">(footnote: hoge hoge)<;/a>
 ||<
 I thought I would try to make it alert when I clicked on it for the time being.
 
 Here's the code
 >|javascript|
     // footnote span.footnote with (*)
     $(".footnote").each(function(){
 	var text = this.innerHTML;
 	this.innerHTML = "(*)"
 	this.href = "#";
 	$(this).click(function(){
 	    alert(text);
 	});
     });
 ||<
 
 But when I click on it, I don't get an ALERT. What's wrong?
 
 <hr>
 
 Ah, ok, I guess I shouldn't have done z-index: -2 on #container and z-index: -1 on hr to put the hr behind the body text. This is relative to the value of the parent element, which would make the hr -3. Also, it doesn't seem to do well with negative values. Maybe this is why the click event was being received by the body or something. I set z-index: 2 on the container and z-index: -1 on the hr and it works as expected.
