Examples of Bad Know-How
In IE6-11 CSS
　Only in IE6, an underscore in front of a property name is considered identical.
　Only in IE6 and 7 is an asterisk in front of the property name considered identical.
	IE6-10, adding \9 at the end of the value does not affect the value.
	In IE6-8, :not(:target){ ~ } is not interpreted
	In IE6-9, @media all and (-ms-high-contrast: none) { ~ } is not interpreted
Change CSS depending on browser version by combining

	code:css
	 .sample {
      background: #000000;
      background: #888888\9;
      *background: #777777;
      _background: #666666;
  }
  .sample:not(:target) {
    background: #999999\9;
  }
  @media all and (-ms-high-contrast: none) {
      .sample:not(:target) {
          background: #bbbbbb;
          background: #aaaaaa\9;
      }
  }
　This should change the behavior in each of 6-11, but I haven't checked because I'm too lazy to verify with old IE.
