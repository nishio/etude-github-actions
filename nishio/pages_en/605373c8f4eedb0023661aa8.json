Want to learn systematically want to take what is systematized for granted.
Often, "[I want to] learn systematically" is "I want to [take] what someone else has [systematized].

	>Hiro Tokumaru> Once, Ueno Noboru asked me why Tokumaru was able to write the Tokumaru book, and although I couldn't answer him at the time, I think it was probably because Tokumaru had the ability to systematize on his own because he kept doing inefficient study methods. Web security was not systematized at that time.
	>>So, when people ask me for an "efficient way to learn," I say, "You should go to the appropriate department at the university and study. There is no better way," I will answer. If that is not possible for various reasons, there is probably no single answer, and it depends on your goals and the resources available to you. If you ask me a question vaguely, I can't answer it.
	This is an important point. People who say "I want to learn [systematically]" are saying "I want to take what someone else has systematized", which is the same as saying "I want to take what someone else has systematized".
	In the short term, efficiency appears high, but that is only because the cost of payment appears low because the cost of acquiring "[systematizing skills]" has not been paid.
