 *1285226258*I went to visit SPYSEE's company.
 Last Friday, I went to visit id:amachang's new company (Oma Corporation).

 To be honest, when I first heard about the company, I thought maybe I was being duped by someone bad, but when I looked inside, I found a venture company with a homey atmosphere. The goal is hot! To SPYSEE to change the world!

 I am looking forward to seeing how amachang will transform itself in the future.

 Incidentally, my entry on the day amachang left our company, "<a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20100915/1284566744'>A picture of a beautiful woman appears at the top of SPYSEE! </a>" was foreshadowing, but it didn't seem to affect my new job forecast Totocarcho #amatoto.(smiles) id:yukoba's "@yukoba I see! I'll drop more fuel! I'm pranking the first page that comes up on Google with "amachang company name", but it gets fixed. Here's a cute amachang image of me being pranked with a "Cute!
 
 *1285264330*Multiple Inheritance Summary
 Java allows multiple inheritance only for those that do not have a special implementation called Interface. There is no mechanism for multiple inheritance of implementations. When two Interfaces that have methods with the same signature are inherited, there is no error and the conflict is not noticed.
 
 Python allows multiple inheritance of classes. When two classes that have methods with the same name are inherited, the C3 linearization is used to determine which method is called. see: <a href='http://192.220.96.201/dylan/linearization-oopsla96.html'>A Monotonic Superclass Linearization for Dylan</a>.
 
 Ruby allows multiple inheritance only for Modules, which "cannot inherit anything and cannot be instantiated"; since a Module cannot inherit from another, method resolution is a simple search (if include A include B, the implementation in B takes precedence).
 
 Smalltalk has a mechanism called Trait that allows multiple inheritance of implementations. When two traits with the same signature method are inherited, one of them can be hidden to avoid collision, and the other can be renamed so that both can be called. see: Traits: Composable Units of Behavior
 
 Scala's Trait is very different from Smalltalk's, despite the name Trait. When two Traits inherit from one another that have methods with the same signature, it is not possible to hide one of them to avoid conflicts, or rename them so that they can both be called. If a method does not have an override modifier, it is an error, and if it does, it uses serialization to determine which method to call, just like in Python.
 
 Role is included from Perl6. This is almost identical to Smalltalk's Trait. see http://publius-ovidius.livejournal.com/314737.html
 
 PHP has a Java-like single inheritance, interface, etc. Starting with PHP 5.4, Trait is included. This is almost the same as Perl's Role. <a href='http://wiki.php.net/rfc/traits'>PHP: rfc:traits [PHP Wiki]</a>
 
 ** Acknowledgement
 Thanks to id:sumim, id:moriyoshi and id:kmizushima for their knowledge other than Python. Thank you very much!
 
 ** Q&A
 >>
 Why is there no id:yujiorama C++/D? Because it's known.
 <<
 C++, D, C#, OCaml, Eiffel, and numerous other object-oriented languages are missing because they either didn't happen to be mentioned, couldn't be organized concisely, or weren't interesting to write about. You can contribute!
