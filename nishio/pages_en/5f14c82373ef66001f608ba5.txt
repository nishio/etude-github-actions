Regarding NoCode, I've seen people talk about the set of newly written programs in their minds and say that "NoCode can only do a portion of what NoCode can do" or "There are things that NoCode can't cover," but I think this is a limited view.

They are narrowing their vision to only "problems that can be solved by writing a new program."

 The way I see it, "What NoCode can cover is only part of the story."


Only a part of the jobs that customers want to solve can be solved by writing a new program.

	Most errands are being taken care of with a combination of existing tools.
		It could be pen and paper or Excel and email.
		There are options that are not originally "write a new program".
	　The addition of a new NoCode tool (N) here is nothing special from a customer perspective.

	　Customers use whatever tools are handy to get their own errands done.

Technically, any problem that can be solved by using the NoCode tool can also be solved by writing a program.
	In other words, what NoCode is trying to solve is not a technical problem in the first place.
	Many of our clients have errands that are being handled without programming at this time.
 	A program to help with this would increase productivity.
 	But we can't make it in-house.
	　Outsourcing the program would solve the problem, but the cost is too high compared to the expected utility, so it is not outsourced.
	NoCode is going to take this area.

If the NoCode tool is in the cloud and API rich, you can automate errands by writing programs
	This is an interesting point for programmers
	It can be automated with far less work than writing a program to do an entire errand.
	This area (LowCode) is created by the proliferation of NoCode tools that are aware of creating this area.
	　Specifically, API maintenance, sample code release, etc.
	From the customer's perspective, NoCode is just another way to run errands.
		From the customer's perspective, "pen and paper", "apps without APIs", and NoCode tools are just "one of the tools to run errands".
		Programmers are more likely to provide value if they are asked to use NoCode tools.
	This "LowCode area being created" is interesting from a programmer's perspective, but many people don't get it from a customer's perspective.
	　In the long run, the effect is to make the "automation of errands" easier to obtain.
	　I feel like I still have to put a lot of time and effort into recognition to get people to recognize me.

		I think this diagram is not good, the definition area is unclear.
		It's funny that the same diagram shows the jobs that will be created after the spread of NoCode.
