 Thoughts.
 　If no connected component of size 1 can be created by removing any edge, the second vertex from the edge has a rank greater than or equal to 3.
 　When you can make size x, you can also make size N-x-1
 　When size N-1 cannot be made, there should not be a point with rank 1.
 　　Recheck the conditions, this is not possible because it is a tree, not an arbitrary graph.
