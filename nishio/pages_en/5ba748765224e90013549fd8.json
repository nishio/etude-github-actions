Buddhist service for the anniversary of the death of Shotoku Taishi (orig. the 22nd day of the 2nd month of the lunar calendar)
	[Sanyutta Nikaya 6.1.1].
	The story is that the enlightened [Buddha] said, "Even if I preach this enlightenment, no one will understand it," to which Brahma replied, "Sure, most people won't understand it, but there are a few who will, so preach it to them.
 There are many interpretations of this episode.
 	Brahman (= Brahman), the most high and mighty God, asked Buddha to preach, Buddha amazing!
  You foiled it by having him ask Brahma, the supreme deity of the prevailing religion of the time.
  That Bhutta thought, even for a moment, that there was no need to save sentient beings is a stain.
  The Brahma-sangha request is a mythologization of "the masses asking the Buddha to preach his teachings."
  This Brahma is a Namuchi (demon) in disguise, trying to delay Buddha's liberation and create an opportunity for his fall.
