Finding links between multiple projects
An experiment to pick up keywords from the most recent one-day update in Scrapbox's Project A and present pages containing those keywords from Project B.
　In this case, A is this public project and B is a private project of about 400 pages

If it seems to have a good effect, run it regularly once a day.

context
	[Diary of 2021-05-04].
　[About Scrapbox private to public transfers].

What we did.
　Get ✅public's most recently updated pages
　✅Extract keywords from its content
　　Just the one that is explicitly bracketed for now.
　　You can get it from the API.
　✅Find and present ✅from different sources that contain those keywords.
　There are two ways to search on your own after exporting to JSON and hitting the search API.
　This time, the search API
　How to present
　　Create a page in private
　　　Because the search results of a private project cannot be made public
　 There is an option to send a DM in Slack.
　 ✅ this time I printed it and pasted it into Scrapbox by hand

result
　(of) good appearance
　I thought it was a private memo repository with not much information, but there were some surprisingly interesting pages.
　　I got some hits from the experiment, like the one where I transcribed a recording of a video conference.
　105 keywords extracted from 24 hours of activity
　The number of hits found in the search is 11.
　　The search API yields the hit rows.
　There are some not-so-good keywords.
　　Research, Organization, Scrapbox, Unexplored Jr.
　　Too many hits.
　　It is better to display only the information "many hits" if the number of hits exceeds a certain level.
　　In the original project, it is only connected if both pages are bracketed, which is not a large number.
　　Three of the four cases were bracketed.
　　　So, if you have a lot of search results, you can only show the number of results instead of the number of results, and bracket that search term instead.
　　　Always do search keyword bracketing.
　　　Rather, "Is there already a link?" and if so, is it better not to search?

impressions
　relatively good
　There are a number of other projects that seem to have a lot of interesting content dead in the water.
　　I want to have more than one target project.

additional experiment
　I was thinking mainly of my public/private collaboration, so I couldn't publish the results because one of them was private.
　I realized I could do both public.
　　And with the current version, which uses search instead of export, you can target other people's projects without any permission.

  >A gated community is a residential area with a gate (gate) and a wall around the perimeter to restrict access to the property by non-residents, thereby preventing through traffic and improving security.
  The concept of a gated community itself is not new; there have been concessions and U.S. military houses in the past, and it is merely a redefinition of the term. In Japan, it is also referred to as a gated town[1] or gated community[2]. `

Updated to account for the case where the output project and the project to be searched are different.
　The `[1]` in the quote from rushitamemo has become a search keyword.
　Should it be `~`? I fixed it by hand for now.
　The output of a machine should not be fixed by hand and maintained for a long period of time.
　　I'm only doing it now because it's an experiment.
　　　It's confusing the links for this project, so I'll eventually kick it out to gist or something.
　　Hopefully, if nothing is done, it will be overwritten after a day and disappear.
　　Any useful links should be noted on a separate page

impressions
　It's nice to see other people's presentations on technical keywords that I'm interested in and have written down.
　We all think we are using the same Japanese, but there are differences in the choice of words we use to express our thoughts.
　　In my project, I use the word "exclusion" to refer to the removal of a person from a group of people (this is not my word either, but something I wrote down after seeing other people's expressions).
　　On the other hand, shokai is used to refer to "removing harmful features or functions from software.
　　By comparing [notice the differences].
　If you look at the keywords displayed and tweak the page in various ways, of course it will be an "updated page" tomorrow, and the same thing will be displayed.
　　This must be boring.
　　Remember what you put out once and don't put it out for a week to a month, and so on.
