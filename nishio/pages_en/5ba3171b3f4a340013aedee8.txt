A practical example of information granularity by Jiro Kawakita
from [granularity of information].
How much information will be written on each KJ method fusen, and how granularly will it be chopped?

A real example by [Jiro Kawakita] himself ([Explorations in Knowledge] p.123)

	On the right side, there are "[dotted note], [rakugaki]" which were written down in shorthand during the interview.
 The label on the left is made from a clean copy of it.
	>Each label sheet consists of two rows of small labels (4 cm long), 12 labels in total, affixed to a backing sheet. The individual labels are perforated so that they can be torn off from the backing paper as well. (p.121)
	Is 4 cm even smaller than my [38 mm x 50 mm] label?
	　About 40mm x 15mm [No.4 label].

	[I think people who are not familiar with the KJ method may find it "very granular.
	　Especially when you imagine so-called [information cards] with the expression "write information on a card and arrange it
 	I would think that a lot more text would be written.
　On the other hand, many people write in one word when they are given a limited amount of time to make labels at workshops, etc.
　　Writing a lot takes time.

The granularity of the nameplate after grouping
　See the illustration made by Jiro Kawakita himself, such as [The Mists of Invisibility].
　Often hear the comment, "Surprisingly long."
　　If you've categorized your labels, your nameplate tends to be the one word that represents that categorical category.
　　It's not just whether it's one word or not, but also the high percentage of verbs it contains.
　　　Related: [verb to explain].
　　 It's hard to explain with verbs if you've classified them.
