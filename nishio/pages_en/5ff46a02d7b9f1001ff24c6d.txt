 Thoughts.
 　For example, if you have 1,4,2,3 and you choose 4 first, you cannot choose 2 or 3.
 　If you divide the cases from the end by "if you choose, if you don't choose", you get 2^2000.
 　　Is it too subtle to decide off the top of your head because even if you don't choose one, you will eventually have to choose one?
 　　Need to find an extremely monotonically increasing sequence?
 　Decide from the smallest instead of the first?
 　　different-looking
 　Maybe a change in the order of addition...
 　　[The expected value of a sum is the sum of its expected value] kind of
 　　The "final selection" for each number is "whether the number to the left of you that is greater than you is selected before you."
 　　Can I consider 1/(1+x) when there are x large numbers left in total?
 　　Not good, when 4,2,3, the probability of 2 being chosen is 2/3 instead of 1/2
 　　 Because when 3 is chosen, 4 can't be chosen.
