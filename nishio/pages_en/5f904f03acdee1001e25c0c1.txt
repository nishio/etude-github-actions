　Thoughts.
　　Do not calculate in square orders.
　　Exactly half of the entire matrix [half of the matrix].
　　I wonder if the XOR and the order of the sums could be interchanged...
　　It would be difficult to add all the digits, but I guess it could be done bit by bit.
		OK, the following holds for the 0/1 column
	 [$ \sum_i^N x_i = K \iff \sum_i^N (1 \oplus x_i) = N - K] [XOR and sum exchange].
　　In other words, you can count the number of 1's for each digit of all the numbers in advance, and find the sum by inverting the above formula only where the 1 in Ai stands, which is fast enough since the number of digits is 60.
　　Since what we have obtained here is the whole matrix, we can halve it to get the answer
　Official Explanation
　　The above is sufficient, but the official explanation does a similar conversion further
　　[$ \sum_j \sum_i (x_i \oplus x_j) = \sum_j ([x_j = 0]  K + [x_j = 1] (N - K)) =  (N - K) K + K (N - K) ]
　　Since the value we want is half of this [$ K (N - K)].
