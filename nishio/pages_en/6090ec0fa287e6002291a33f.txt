 My first 3D printer output. It will hold 17 different resistors, 6 each. I will use the color bar output script I used the other day to make a heading for it and put it on as a lid and fasten it with rubber. I also put in 4 10M resistors, which are a bit thicker than the others. It's hard to take out because there is no play, but it's OK because I don't use them that often.
 
 It seems that you can download the data from here and print it yourself, or you can order it here directly. http://make.dmm.com/item/406392/
 
 I started installing Autodesk 123D at 9:30 p.m. on 12/7, completed STL data at 11 p.m. while watching an instructional video on how to operate the software, and submitted the STL data to a 3D printing service, received a quote, and placed an order, all in front of my PC. I was going to print it with transparent acrylic, but when I got a quote, it was 9992 yen, so I changed it to white nylon, thinking "I can't spend that much from the first step. So I changed it to white nylon, thinking "I can't pay that much for the first step. By the way, plaster costs 4,668 yen.
 
 The modeling started on 12/9 and was shipped in the afternoon of 12/14.
 
 I was getting excited thinking, "If this size costs 3,000 yen, how much would it cost to make a Raspberry Pi case?
 
 ** Cube
 
 A 10mm cube costs 1554 yen for nylon and 807 yen for plaster.
 
 Nylon 81646 yen, plaster 162602 yen for a 100mm cube
 
 The volume is 1,000 times greater, but the price is at most 50 to 200 times greater.
 
 ** Box
 
 For a box type with 5 sides blocked and 10mm cube, nylon 1470 yen, plaster 656 yen. The face is 0.7 mm.
 For a 50mm cube, nylon costs 2514 yen and plaster 2606 yen. Plaster is more expensive here. It is likely that plaster has a higher price per volume of material cost. This is a 1mm surface.
 A 100mm cube costs 7378 yen for nylon and 11725 yen for plaster. By the way, this one has 1mm face, but only the bottom is 3mm by mistake. (Actually, I made the last three as shown above later, so my modeling skills are improving while I am working on them.)
 If you penetrate that thick bottom and make it tubular, it will go down to 4869 yen for nylon and 7023 yen for gypsum.
 
 Before doing this, I somehow assumed that the size of the bounding box was the main factor determining the price, but since the three 100mm cubic examples are 4869 yen, 7378 yen, and 81646 yen, volume is clearly the biggest factor. It is supposed to be cheaper if you make the walls thinner or open mesh holes if they don't need to be flat and blocked. The resistor case above was designed with 2mm outer wall and 1mm bulkhead, but at least the bulkhead could be thinner.

 <body>I think you need to do a little bit of everything to get a feel for it. <br>Although materials are limited, it might be better to buy a cheap 3D printer. </body>
