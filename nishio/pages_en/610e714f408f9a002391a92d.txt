Bugs that gather information that can hurt you.
They go out of their way to gather information about gruesome murders and suffer mental damage from it.
[human bug].

The person perceives that "I don't want to see it, but it's in my eyes," but whether everyone else in the world "sees" that information to the same degree, that's not the case at all.

From this, we can see that they voluntarily behave in a way that would allow that type of information to come in, yet they dislike the fact that it is coming in. It is quite bug-like.
