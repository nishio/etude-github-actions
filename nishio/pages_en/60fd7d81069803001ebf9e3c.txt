2021-07-26Diary of Corona
I was against holding the Olympics, but as long as they are held, whether I watch the opening ceremony on TV at home or not has absolutely no effect on the spread of infection.

So when I heard that the event would be held without spectators but with people all around the stadium, I wondered if I would go to see it.
>At 8 p.m., the crowd grew to about 4,700 people, even though the general public was not allowed in the stadium.
> In the week to the 22nd, the average number of people at midnight was about 2,200 and at 8 p.m. about 1,500; on the 23rd, by comparison, there were about 3,000 more people in all time zones.

And I wrote my diary because I saw this on Twitter

I haven't seen any stories about this lately.
I see this instead.

The latter is easy to read for detailed figures.
It's hard to see the "change" since neither of the graphs are in chronological order.
The way information is expressed changes the ease with which it is conveyed.

The numerator, 12635, would be the sum of 2632 for hospitalization + 1762 for overnight care + 5601 for home care + 2640 for adjustment.
What's the denominator 9114.

That's 6314 secured beds plus 2800 secured beds for overnight care.

It was found that there are two groups: "12635 infected, 9114 secured beds in hospitals and residential care, nearly 40% over" and "2023 hospitalized, 5882 secured beds in hospitals, still only about 30% filled".
Both are true, just with different values we are looking at. The latter is a value that never exceeds 100%, though.

Oh, there was a time line graph.

Last June, when there were fewer infections, almost 80% of the patients were hospitalized. In other words, if the hospital can afford it, it should be preferable to hospitalize 80% of the patients.
At the time of the dramatic increase in infections in January, the total number of hospitalizations and overnight care was less than 20%.
Now again, the situation is that inpatient residential care is now less than 50% of the total.

That's because people gather even for the opening ceremony, where they don't know what they'll see, so they'll gather where they can see the athletes if they can.

After all, it is a system where the daily increase will increase if the number of times it continues to exceed 1x, and it is a story that could have been foreseen when the number of times it exceeds 1x and keeps going up, but when it becomes "the most ever," many people in the world finally start to feel a sense of crisis. And if we change our behavior now, the results will not be seen until two weeks from now.
It's a [human bug] that every time there's a peak, the timing of when people wait for the crisis is getting slower and slower.
[I wonder if this is related to what you said about "those who work by analogy and those who work by abstraction.

>According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, there were 698 "emergency transport difficulty cases" in the fourth week of July in which the destination of a patient suspected of being infected with corona could not be determined for more than 30 minutes, an increase of 1.6 times from the previous week.
