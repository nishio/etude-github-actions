Projects with deadlines
[https://gyazo.com/a427fdffce74b273ea4df7f045b12257]

Think about projects that have deadlines, especially those that have a final report of results with a fixed date and time and a constraining condition that prevents you from moving the project at all at your convenience.

Let's say the plan was to reach the right end of the spectrum at the results briefing. Let's say something went wrong and you were a little late.

The way we proceeded above, we were going to be in the process of making it all the way through, and finally it was going to be finished and in a form that people would find valuable. If we delay a little, we will have to present it in a "work in progress" state, scoring 0 on a 100-point scale. This is terrible.

In the method of proceeding below, we first complete "something that is not quite right, but can be demonstrated," and then gradually improve it while keeping it ready for demonstration. Even if it is a little late and will not be ready in time for the results presentation, it will still score 80 on a 100-point scale.
