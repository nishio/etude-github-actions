　Thoughts.
　　Should we separate them by length even or odd?
　　If we fix the center and expand the range, the new range will be doubled if the letters are different, and doubled if they are not different.
　　Still, that's not very efficient at all.
　　I'm surprised it's not "answer the remainder" when there are 200,000 characters.
　　DP to make the range a defined area?
　　　If two pairs of letters are different, the number of cases is +1 for all ranges that include the pair of exchanges.
　　Ha, the inclusion-elimination principle?
　　　No, you can't narrow it down by symmetry, so no.
 Official Explanation
 　Strings made up of two different kinds of characters at both ends can never match each other

 　If you notice this, [subtract the extra event] changes to "count the number of matching pairs".
 　This is obtained by [frequency → triangular number
