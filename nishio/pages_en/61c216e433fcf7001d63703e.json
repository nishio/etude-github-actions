person who hangs a spider's thread
We talked about how when one person feels that another person X is intellectually inferior to him or her, there are two kinds of people: person A who drops "[spider thread]" and person B who rejects X.
Person A, who hangs the line, is also like, "Oh, you fell in, I can't help it," and is not so strongly enthusiastic about pulling up, but there is a big difference between hanging the line and not hanging the line.

Personally, I see the A's hanging by a thread as having more fun in life. Because there is a possibility of "unexpected success." Those who have a style of [rejection] from the beginning have closed the door of [possibility] by themselves.

After writing this, I read the original version of [Spider's Thread] and realized. When I wrote the above, I had the image of "A=Buddha" and "X=Kandata". However, "A/B=Kandata" and "X=many people following from below" were more appropriate.

In the first place, Buddha is working "to save many sentient beings," which is necessarily A. When Kandata saw the multitude that followed him from below, he should have felt A, saying, "This will save the multitude. Then he could have been in the same situation as Buddha. However, in the story, he behaved as B. By doing so, he could no longer reach the same state of being as Buddha, and he fell to the bottom.
