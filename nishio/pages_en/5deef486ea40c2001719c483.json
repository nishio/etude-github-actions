	Until now, a path of constant width was written, independent of zoom.
		Lines get thinner when zoomed out.
	Path Thickness
		Selection enclosure, dotted line spacing, movement speed
		Path smoothing units
	If it's a physical paper metaphor, the apparent line thickness will be thicker when zoomed in.
		But toolbars, etc. naturally remain the same size, independent of zoom.
		Which is closer to the thickness of the drawn line

---
	Line thickness should correspond to screen zoom
		Now when I zoom in, the lines get thicker.
		Same for the dotted line of lasso selection.
