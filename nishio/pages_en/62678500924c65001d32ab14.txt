[Summary of past presentations].
　I used to put my presentation materials on [Slideshare], but nowadays I tend to make my presentation materials in Scrapbox, present in Scrapbox, and add questions afterwards.
　Slide presentation materials are difficult to add to due to the paper size restrictions of the slides, but Scrapbox allows additions without restrictions.
　Scrapbox can connect to other pages with links.
