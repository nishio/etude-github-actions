Hoge's language paradox
This is a meaningful classic in that it points out that "[I] cannot understand the value of a tool that I cannot master." On the other hand, it [implicitly assumes a single axis] in the form of "[a] spectrum of abstractions."

>The Paradox of the "Hoge Language
>Let me illustrate my point here using the hypothetical programming language "Hoge". Let's assume that "Hoge" falls right in the middle of the abstraction spectrum. ... When this Mr. Programmer looks down the spectrum of power, he is aware that he is doing so. Any language less powerful than "hoge" is obviously less powerful. It doesn't have the features he is accustomed to. But when this programmer looks in the opposite direction, he does not realize that he is looking up. All he sees is a strange language. Maybe they are as powerful as "hoge," but somehow they have all sorts of fluffy extras, he thinks. For him, "hoge" is enough. Because he thinks in "hoge.
> But think of a programmer using another more powerful language, and he is probably looking down on Hoge. What in the world can you do with "hoge"? It doesn't even have a function y.
