(6.2.5) Things that have not become words yet
Up to this point, I have likened what is made into words and what is not made into words to the part of an [iceberg] above and below the surface of the water.
We have progressed from [abstract concept]s near the top of the mountain to [bodily sensation]s and [metaphor]s near the surface of the water, and have come closer to the surface.
What is the closest thing to the surface of the water? I believe it is a sense of [discomfort]([IWAKAN]). In this section, I will explain [tacit knowledge] and discomfort. This is because tacit knowledge and discomfort are two sides of the same coin.
