 *1277519415*[Kaizen] Handling of comments
 Reprinted from Twitter
 >>
 I have been omitting comments of mere affirmation or agreement because they are not informative, but then I would have to mention them in case of denial or disagreement. Do I need to comment in agreement to go through disagreement? Wouldn't it be zero information if I rephrased what I understood in my own words instead of mere agreement?
 <<
 The least expensive way to deal with comments is to "let it all go by," but my ability to let it all go by is not good enough, so I can't put comments I don't agree with on the same level as comments I do agree with, and I end up going right into them. As a result, I end up having a lot of discussions with the person who wrote the comment I disagree with.
 
 I guess the correct response is to agree when the comments are agreeable and go through the motions when the comments are disagreeable. It seems obvious when you think about it.

 I thought I'd note the OCaml reference link you gave me on my blog, or better yet, I thought it would be a good idea to put it all together and have it jump from the sidebar of my blog anyway.
