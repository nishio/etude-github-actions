AI will take your job and give you three days off a week.
>What has happened with mechanization and automation is not an increase in unemployment, but a reduction in the number of hours worked per person.
> From 2426 hours in 1960 to 1779 hours in 2009, a 27% decrease, and in the process, two days off a week has become the norm.
> I think it's not the increase in unemployment that will be caused by AI to improve efficiency, but [the three-day workweek].
>A 16% increase in efficiency from 6 workers working 6 days a week would create 6 workers working 5 days a week instead of 1 unemployed worker.
> Similarly, I believe that a 20% increase in efficiency does not produce one unemployed person from five workers, but rather five workers working four days a week.
