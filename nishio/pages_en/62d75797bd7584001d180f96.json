Beethoven to propose a plan and take a budget.

Unix was created by a few researchers who thought that MULTICS, a huge industry-academia collaboration project, was a bad idea. (Unix was originally created by a small number of researchers who thought MULTICS, a huge industry-academia collaboration project, was not going to work.)
> WWW was also born out of the nostalgia of a huge research institute like CERN, where you can do whatever you want. I think it would be a bad idea to make it a [purpose-oriented] organization like "Next Generation Information Sharing Platform Research Organization", maybe GNU too (where geniuses like Stallman can live without the pressure of writing papers).
> But that kind of "continually pay for gobbledygook" is hard to explain, so it won't last forever.
> I think it's the [patron] type that allows the gnashing of teeth, but when that disappears, you have to [propose a plan] and get a budget for everything... I imagined Beethoven presenting a symphony with chorus and saying, "I'm going to write a symphony with chorus.
> But this is also subtly different from "don't let basic researchers develop products"... Basic is not so much far from practical application as it is a conventional game changer...
