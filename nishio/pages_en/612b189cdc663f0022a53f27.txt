	Did you see my bag? Did you see my bag?
	트로피들로 백이 가득해
		teulopideullo baeg-i gadeughae
		Bags full of trophies
	How you think 'bout that? How you think 'bout that?
	Hater들은 벌써 학을 떼
		Hater deul-eun beolsseo hag-eul tte
		Hater has already learned
	이미 황금빛 황금빛 나의 성공
		imi hwang-geumbich hwang-geumbich naui seong-gong
  Already golden golden my success!
	I'm so firin', firin' 성화봉송
		seonghwabongsong
		Olympic torchlight service
	너는 황급히 황급히 도망 숑숑
		neoneun hwang-geubhi hwang-geubhi domang syongsyong
		You scurry and scurry away.
	How you dare? How you dare? How you dare?
