Why are you interested in learning?

I was asked but could not answer immediately, so I researched historical facts.

	2010-08 Presentation on "[Language Design Decisions https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-5019563]" at Security & Programming Camp
 I was publishing the material and was asked to write a feature article for a magazine.
 	2010-12 Gijutsu Hyoronsha WEB+DB PRESS Vol.60 Special issue 1: "[Fundamentals of Language Design http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20101207/1291734422]"
 The book was so well received that we decided to write a book.
 Technology that underpins [coding]."
  I wrote, "It's important to learn languages by comparing them."
  I started thinking about "why it's important" and wrote a chapter about it, but it was cut by an editorial decision.
   [Knowledge, Capitalism, and the Technologist Condition]
	 Break it down into columns and pack them in the end-of-chapter margins.
  At the time of publication, it was reprocessed and put together in the form of promotional slides.
   2013-04-09 [How to learn what? https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-18540949] [What do we learn how?"]
   [What do we learn? 2: Three major input methods https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-19956967]

 When I get feedback that the column was helpful, I'm convinced that I should dig into this after all.

   I learned about Drucker's "Seven Opportunities for Innovation" and learned that it is important not to miss [unexpected successes].
   Recognizing the phenomenon that is occurring as an "unexpected success," [they] go on to [reproduce it].

  After picking it up and reading it, I realized that the guideline I was looking for "before the [PDCA cycle] starts turning" is here!

	"Current [groupware] is something that is verbalized and then shared electronically, and how to verbalize what is not verbalized is weak."
	Technology [to assist with verbalization] needs to be researched."

	2015-07 Linguistic Support Methods
		Changed the theme of the call for Labo Youth to "Linguistic Technology".
 	I was about to do a [public lecture https://github.com/nishio/cylaby], but it was cancelled due to office relocation and other hiccups.

	Then went on to write "[Engineers' Intellectual Production Techniques].

	Background Information
  2004 "It's important to learn by comparing languages" should have been considered useful by the time I was teaching programming to juniors during my doctoral program, because I was teaching Java and Python by comparing them.
 	2007 [PythonDevelopersCamp2007 Winter: You don't need classes! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=legkcj5vQN8&feature=youtu.be], "I thought you really thought of a way to share an easy-to-understand way of understanding how it works."

 	2008 The first technical book I wrote [Jython Programming http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/archives/51040648.html] is unexpectedly regarded as "a very well written programming beginner book". [unexpected success].
