Roughly speaking, a company with 1,000 employees posting an average of 1,000 words daily to the groupware would pay less than $200 per day for embedding every utterance.

Assuming an average of 10 posts, that's 60MB of vector indexes created per day, so Pinecore's pay-as-you-go fee is $0.05, or about $1,000 in running costs.
