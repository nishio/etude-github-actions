It's a hassle to look up links every time you want to introduce someone to something you use, so we've put together a page to make it easier for you in the future.

[* BAN ORTLIEB messenger bag, black, 30L].
[https://gyazo.com/4f087445be1b2ad37b45aa5e4d56d3a1]
	http://amzn.to/2ez7Emq
 Since 11/27/2015. Previously used yellow (since 12/2/2009)
 By closing the waist belt and chest belt, the weight is supported not by the shoulders but by the entire back from the waist down, which reduces the burden on the body.
 Large capacity. Mainly used for 3-day/2-night camps.
 I went on a 9-day trip to England with just this one bag.

 For daily commuting
 Completely waterproof, so your electronic equipment is safe even if you encounter a guerrilla downpour
 I used to have a 20L in a similar color (from 6/25/2013) I replaced it because it was sore after 4 years of use (I stepped on the metal fittings of the waist belt with a chair and destroyed it).

 I am not particularly particular about the manufacturer, etc. It is important that they are active muffled headphones.
 I want to prevent noise from interfering with my thinking when working in a cafe or on a train.
	Use earplugs in combination with earplugs when it is seriously loud.

Other
	Shoes: [MBT http://www.mbt.com/ja-jp]
	Vitamins: [New Neovitamin EX "Kunihiro" http://amzn.to/2iSQ3XP]
 	Same ingredients as Alinamin, famous in commercials
  I feel subjectively more tired when I drink before bed, but I'm not blind to it.
 Eye masks [TEMPUR http://amzn.to/2iQHBIJ] and [earplugs] [MOLDEX http://amzn.to/2iRwhfp]
  I use an eye mask every day.
  Combined use of earplugs when sleep rhythm is about to be disrupted, such as at a training camp or on a business trip, or when sleep is in short supply
 	Sleep deeper and feel like you can recover in a shorter period of time
  Also, I think the [self-suggestion] of "I'm going to sleep now" and "I'm going to recover efficiently" by wearing this is also significant.

	[Sticky note]
	Notepad is [RHODIA].
 I used to use [Moleskine] A4 notebooks, but [iPad Pro] has replaced them.
