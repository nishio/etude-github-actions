Data or Rules.
	In [ppoi], I assumed a use case where the rules cannot be verbalized, but sample data can be provided.
 In some cases, they don't.
 	There is too much equivalent data that goes into unknown.txt.
 	Create some positives/negatives with miscellaneous rules, and then eyeball them and play the incorrect ones to create teacher data.
