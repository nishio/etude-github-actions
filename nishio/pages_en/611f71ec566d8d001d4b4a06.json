Moved to private Kozaneba
　Why Kozaneba:
　　Separate containers for each project will take away what doesn't fit well.
　 Tasks that connect two projects should be easily represented.
　Why undisclosed:
　 Only those projects that clearly fall into the "open to the public" container can be published.
　 The whole hub should be a place where you can write anything, and for that reason, it should be private.

This is what Kozaneba should be about.
　Individual projects could be Scrapbox or Kozaneba.
　　Kozaneba development is managed by Kozaneba, but everything else is still Scrapbox.
　In other words, there are "containers for each project."
　　[container metaphor].
　Items that do not fit well in the container are missed.
　　I have to edit the video before my lecture at the 54th Annual Meeting of the Young Scientists in Information Science -> Come to think of it, I was going to upload my lecture at the Musashino Endowed Chair on YouTube, but I neglected to do so.
　　　Maybe you should re-shoot Keicho's screener before the lecture and introduce it as "what I've been doing lately" - I'm sure you'll be able to find it.
　This should be private.
　　In other words, only those projects that clearly fall into the "good to publish" category are open to the public.
　　Maybe the whole hub should be private.
　　　If only non-public ones are held aside, they will be overlooked, there should be one dashboard.
　　　In order to put anything on, it needs to be private, that thing, I can't make it public yet, but when I can make it public, I want to be involved with that project...
