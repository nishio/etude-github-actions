 *1318380596* Typical of study group problems.
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/hyoshiok/20111010#p1'>The Kernel Reading Group - Diary of sometime in the future/hyoshiok</a>. As Mr. Yoshioka wrote, the decline in frequency of study groups due to the high cost of procuring venues is "a typical example of a study group problem". 1000speakers, which I used to do with id:amachang, started out in a lab, but when it became impossible for various reasons, it suffered and stopped. I was not able to do it at the beginning.
 
 However, I think my perception of "what is the essence of the problem" has changed somewhat since those days. So I will record it here.
 
 Securing a venue is inherently costly, and planning how to procure one is part of the management's job. However, we were fortunate that the company was able to supply us with a low-cost venue: "All we had to do was hold down the dates and times available in the company's meeting room reservation system and inform the general manager that we would be holding a kernel reading session on what day. The company cost the company tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for land, electricity, and air conditioning. The company provided this free of charge.
 
 The situation has changed. They still provide us with everything at no cost, but the procedure has become slightly more cumbersome. The cost of dealing with delays has jumped.
 
 Have you made it an objective to maintain all the "achievements that were once possible under the former circumstances" despite the fact that circumstances have changed? It doesn't say specifically, but if "there is also the cost of assigning receptionists, elevator attendants, etc. to handle late arrivals," but two people are held for an hour, then if the hourly wage is 2,000 yen, the cost is 4,000 yen, right? Should we pay that cost and still maintain the "let in late" response? Is that important to the "Kernel Reading Group"? Is it something you want to gain?
 
 The uncritical "status quo" of "things that used to be easy to do but are now costing more," along with many other things, appears to be the cause of the high costs. Shouldn't we reevaluate what it was that we wanted to gain and discard those things that give little return for the cost?
 
 I think most of the problem can be solved if we don't free-ride on the company to procure the venue, but pay for it ourselves and outsource it to a specialized company. I looked into a rental conference room that can accommodate 80 people, and paying 1000-2000 yen per person for a 4-hour rental would be sufficient. The reason why you cannot take that option is probably because the ideal that Mr. Yoshioka wants to protect is "no participation fee. That ideal has not been verbalized, and it is hard to read from that sentence. That's why people are saying, "Why don't you just charge for it?
 
 Why not start with a verbal list of what the Kernel Reading Group is currently OR used to achieve? Things like "no entry fee," "10 meetings a year," "late arrivals accepted," "beer bash," etc. Then you would have to admit that you can't keep all of these and scrap some of them.

 - Securing venues is part of the management strategy of resource procurement planning, and if this does not lead to differentiation, then outsourcing should be considered.
 - You can't do anything new without discarding the old.

 I got an email saying that the Artificial Intelligence course had started, so I took a look at it right away.
 
 It's basically like watching a lecture video on YouTube, but with this quiz in the middle

 I haven't tried to see if I have to answer the question to see the next video, or if the next video without an answer is treated as an incorrect answer.
 
 If you look at the PROGRESS page, this is what it looks like. It seems that if you don't answer correctly the first time, it doesn't matter if you answer again and answer correctly. I was aiming for 100% at first.

 Homework, I was going to solve it quickly, but I don't know where to start looking at it. I wonder if I have to watch all the videos of the class to see it. So I'm watching only the first and the last one at the moment.
 
 By the way, I thought I had registered for machine learning as my main focus and for database and AI as well, but I haven't received an email telling me that the machine learning program has started even though the machine learning program has started as well... I guess I failed to register. If you are interested, you can enroll now.
 
 I solved them all. They don't know if they got the homework right until the next class.

 The first lesson in Artificial Intelligence is per A* from breadth-first search. Machine learning is one-variable linear regression. Database is relational algebra and SQL.
