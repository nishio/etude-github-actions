　Thoughts.
　　There are a lot of general operations that I'd like to limit more.
　　Is there an optimal solution that moves 1 first?
　　　Not necessarily.
　　　If 1 is at the beginning from the beginning
　　　To move a number before 1 backward
　　　　For example, 3,1,2 is once if you move 3, but not if you bring 1 to the top.
　　　　Is it OK to choose the first or last value from the one with the furthest distance?
　　Regarding "selecting the first or last value from the one with the furthest distance
　　　Never move the same number twice.
　　　Assuming we don't move the number of the farther distance...
　　　3,2,1,6,5,4
　　　 Doesn't look too bad? I need more certainty.
　　Consider [number of falls
　　　The number of falls is reduced by the number of times the number at the end jumps over the number greater than the number in front of you.
　　　The maximum number of overturns in a column of length N is the triangular number T(N-1)
　　　hmm
　　I want to show that "move the one with the larger number of overturns among the leading or trailing values to the end" is the correct greedy algorithm.
　　　After moving it, it comes down to one smaller problem.
　　　Correct when N is 3.
　　　The number of moves is monotonically nondecreasing with respect to the number of falls, which seems to be the case, but I can't show it.
　　Look again at the constraints
　　　300,000
　　　I don't know how to calculate the number of falls.
　Official Explanation
　　[The order of operations is irrelevant.]
　　　You can think of it as pulling it out [all at the same time] and putting it back in.
　　　In that case, the condition that works is "monotonically increasing the remaining rows that are pulled out."
　　　[longest increasing partial row].
