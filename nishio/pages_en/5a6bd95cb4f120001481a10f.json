物理本のIncrementalReading
[Incremental Reading]の技術を物理本に応用できないか？
 Manage pointers to books on your computer
 1 book draw
 Read one page ([too small habit])
 If you have something to say about what you have read, just say it (compressed).
  If you can't think of anything to leave out, don't write it down (that's how much it was worth).
 The next interval depends on whether there were any leftover notes.
  If not, the interval will increase.

The burial is reminded at progressively longer intervals.
You may also look at the listings or search for the information. In this case, the interval should be shortened.

The [stacked] algorithm of physics books that many people use unknowingly
 Place books in a list as much as possible.
 Read what you see
 Pile it up where you can see it.
Since the system is designed to be able to list and dig out using "what you see" (unconscious search), it breaks down when it comes to hard-to-see e-books and the like.
