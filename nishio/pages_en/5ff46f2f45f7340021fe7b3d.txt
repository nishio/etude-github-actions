 Initial Considerations
  Worst case scenario, whether it's a push or a pull, it's 10^5, so 10^5 queries will break the bank.
  (Tip: In the case of "push", which changes the recipient's value when a notification occurs, it is not allowed if 10^5 people with 10^5 friends send the notification 10^5 times. Conversely, in the case of a "pull", where you go to check who among your friends sent the notification when you confirm the notification, it is not allowed if a person with many friends confirms the notification all the time).
 　[SQUARE DIVISION]
  Delay only the processing of people whose friends are on route N or higher.
  　These people are high route N people.
 　 Only pull these people x when confirming notification
 　 Total number of notifications generated by x with x
 　 The total number of routes y has received from x. Highly route n
 　 Subtract these two and you get the number of new notifications from x
　　Consideration complete
	Official Explanation
	　OK with [square division
