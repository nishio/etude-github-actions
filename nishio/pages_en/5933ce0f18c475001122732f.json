confusion of means and ends
	Confusion of Means and Purpose
 Are means and ends [conflicts]?
 At least when you say, "I'm here today to learn the means."
 Is it wrong to acquire means without a specific goal?
 For example, can the acquisition of means with the specific objective of "increasing [self-efficacy] by mastering the means" be considered purposeless?

	Is [monarchical and slave morality] relevant?
