Very good issues of [Dominion].
　The answers are reasoned and match my pattern of thinking very well.
 The "[double bottom 1/66]" that was being offered did not ring a bell, but I realized later that it was by [March class].
 　I understood the intent of the Alliance's split deck in this article: [https://www.sandomi.net/entry/Allies2 Dominion: Alliance, Day 2 of Previews - I think the Marchists are going to Dominion].
  By the way, I see that you're a thermarchin on your blog and a sealed clay on Twitter. I didn't know what "double bottom 1/66" meant at first either, but I guess it means the probability that the two cards you bought in your first hand sink to the bottom of the deck and don't come in 3-4T is the inverse of [$ _{12}C_2].
