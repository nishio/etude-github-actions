Winning Arguments
Why do you feel [discussions] with Mr. Tachikawa are [productive]?

	We're not "arguing to win".
	If you think you're trying to win or get others to listen to you, you're not being productive.

Why is the argument for winning unproductive?

	Human language is rather tattered, so it is easy to poke holes in it if you want to.
	Trying to prevent that would be incredibly costly to defend.

[Productive debate] focuses on the amount of [intellectual production] per unit of time. Winning or losing is not important.
If both parties agree that "[win or lose] doesn't matter," then both parties may discard the cost of defense.
