 *1224127055*[TopCoder]iVoca now allows users to study "English words from TopCoder".
 <script src='http://www.gmodules.com/ig/ifr?url=http://ivoca.31tools.com/widget.xml&amp;up_bookid=77&amp;synd=open&amp;w=400&amp;h=400&amp;title=iVoca&amp;border=%23ffffff%7C3px%2C1px+solid+%23999999&amp;output=js'></script>
 
 For the English words for the questions, we counted the frequency of occurrence from the past TopCoder questions, divided by the frequency of occurrence in the Gutenberg project sentences, and created a "ranking of words that appear particularly frequently in TopCoder," from which we selected words that seemed interesting at random from the top 300 or so.
 
 I think iVoca is more fun to play with books I made than with books made by others.... I guess it's fun because you know in advance what words are going to appear, and you can proceed quickly.
 
 Therefore, the data of the questions and answers are available to the public:

 They are focusing on reducing the time it takes to build vocabulary.
