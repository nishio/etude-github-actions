 This is very useful for reviewing the structure of a manuscript. I'm writing a book now, and I've been exchanging Sphinx files with my editor on BitBucket, and even the table of contents is rendered in the file preview on BitBucket. Convenient.
 
 The images are embedded properly, but unfortunately the links to the images are broken. I think this could be easily fixed with JS.... If you fix that, I think it would be a very good tool. I think it would solve a lot of troublesome points in the process of engineers writing and publishing manuscripts.
 
 So, it might be interesting to experiment with writing a commentary on the method using that method itself, once I finish the book I'm writing. Or talk about having my wife proofread it using git.
 
 
 補足:
 I'm not sure if I've been able to verbalize it well, but the writing process I've experienced is what programmers call a "waterfall" with a very short testing period, so I'm wondering if it's possible to write in a more lean/agile way. I haven't found the "right" way yet, but I think Sphinx is pretty close.
