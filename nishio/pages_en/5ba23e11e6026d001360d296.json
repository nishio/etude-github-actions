webpack
	I was avoiding it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of putting it all together after implementation.
 `webpack --watch`がある
 tutorial

	$ npx webpack --watch


----- miscellaneous notes
After all, I thought, at each point in time, if you don't select and install the appropriate library at that point in time, it will rub you the wrong way.
If I write it down in detail, it won't work again the next time I do it anyway, so I don't write it down.

	npm init -y
 npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
 npx webpack --mode=development
 	Well, I'm using JSX and it rubs me the wrong way.
 npm i --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react
 npm i -S react react-dom
 	-S == --save

	>Error: Cannot find module '@babel/core'
 > babel-loader@8 requires Babel 7.x (the package '@babel/core'). If you'd like to use Babel 6.x ('babel-core'), you should install 'babel-loader@7'.
$ npm i --save-dev @babel/core
	>Error: Plugin/Preset files are not allowed to export objects, only functions. In /Users/nishio/grouping/node_modules/babel-preset-react/lib/index.js
