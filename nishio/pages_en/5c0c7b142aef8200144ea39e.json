Herzberg's two-factor theory
The question was asked, "By what did you feel satisfied or dissatisfied with your work?"
　Factors that brought satisfaction and factors that brought dissatisfaction were different.
  不満足→作業環境（[衛生要因]）
  Satisfaction → the job itself ([motivating factor])

"[T]he opposite of satisfaction is not dissatisfaction."
	The naive notion that the opposite of satisfaction is dissatisfaction [is a false dichotomy].

"The Motivation to Work"(1959) By Frederick Herzberg, Bernard Mausner, Barbara Bloch Snyderman p.81
The wider the vertical width of the bar, the more it indicates it has a long-term impact.

For example, a small amount of Responsibility does not cause dissatisfaction, but a large amount of Responsibility causes significant long-term satisfaction.
Conversely, a small salary brings long-term dissatisfaction several times greater than Responsibility, but a large salary does not bring as much satisfaction as Responsibility.

It means that the positives and negatives of [the second-order derivative of the utility function] are different for these two factors.
