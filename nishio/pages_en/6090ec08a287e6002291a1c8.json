 The reason why discussions about whether input or output is more important are sterile is that the subject is not clear. For example, if a person does only what he is told to do and does not learn spontaneously, he needs more input, and if he only studies at his desk and does not act, he needs more output.

 The amount of information available today is so vast that it is not practical to learn it all. In this situation, we need to choose what to learn. To do this, it must be clear what the output is. Efficient learning is impossible without clarity of output in today's information flood. And without learning, efficient output is also impossible.
