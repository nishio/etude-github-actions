Don't be the bad guy.

There are people who have a gloomy disposition and see everything as flawed, not out of malice, but because it is their nature. They condemn everything. these things against what they have done, and these things against what they do. This shows their cruel and vile nature. They exaggerate and accuse so much that they make beams that poke their eyes out of their motes. They are always such rulers that they turn paradise into a prison, and if passion intervenes, they push matters to the extreme. In contrast, the noble nature always knows how to find excuses for failure, if not intentionally, at least from oversight.
