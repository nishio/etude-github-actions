 *1200462776*Development Cafe
 http://d.hatena.ne.jp/cocoiti/20080114
 
 I like the development cafe.
 I have also been wondering if it would be possible to create a café where technical books are lined up in place of manga in a manga café, but I'm not sure how to make it happen.
 
 *1200476010*Adium
 I downloaded Adium to install it, but it was a dmg.
 I searched for Aduim+Windows and Dr. Google told me to put in Trillian, so I did.
 Moo.
 I thought you couldn't connect this to Skype. Hmmm...

 I've tried putting it in, but I still don't think it will start.
 
 *1200480682*Au.
 Brain is not in good shape.
 The engine is pulsing and the clutch feels like it is not engaging.
 It's not even spinning well, but it's spinning.
 Uh-oh.
 
 *1200485500* Tablets Everywhere
 In the meantime, I tried the tablet with the Wii remote and projector.
 I can draw a picture, but there's a lot of room for improvement.
 
 *1200487156* I found something like this.

 I can't read. An event called English Conversation with native speakers.
 
 *1200495752*Hah!
 My clutch is not properly engaged...
 
 *1200497450* Hieronymus, not Hierosmith.

 - I look at this and think, it's not Escher, it's not Hierosmith.
 - I tried googling it and it doesn't match with Hierosmith.
 - I searched for "pleasure gardens" and found Hieronymus.

 - I knew it was Hieronymus, I thought.
 - I searched Hieronymus and Escher and found information that Escher copied it.
 - If you look closely, you can see that some of the lines of sight and a few other things have been rewritten.
 - Hieronymus died in 1516. Escher was born in 1898. In other words, one is late Muromachi period, the other is 31st year of Meiji era. Hieronymus must have already been a classic in Escher's time.
 - I didn't think these two were that far apart in time.
 - I wasn't interested in history in middle school and high school, but with Wikipedia, history is interesting. ←I'm here now.

 Postscript:
 - Oh yeah, I was wondering where the Smiths came from, Aerosmith.
 
 *1200498001* Depression
 presence or absence
 Let's go to bed.
 go away!

 <body>Shared rental offices for private business owners might be close to that. The ones run by local governments are different, but the ones operating in Roppongi Hills are probably close. </body> <body>

 <body>The network configuration is different to begin with, and Skype is proprietary P2P, so I don't think Adium (Gaim, Trillian) is possible. Maybe someone has written a plugin that uses the python skype module. </body>
