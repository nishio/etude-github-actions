Exploratory Net Study Group Kozaneba3
Chapter 8.
KJ method
Practical improvements
Exploratory nets play an important role
Fireworks to think about
Haruo Yamaura
One step of touch netting
Independent Techniques
Similar to a round of KJ Act.
The core work is different.
Integrated Fireworks
Need qualitative data first
net-making
label collecting
spatial arrangement
Same as KJ method
Fundamentally different points
do on the condition of a marriage
clip (paper, surgical, etc.)
ã€€3 ways of expression
Take out one piece at a time and place it.
Change the placement of each new label.
It could be changed to a gala.
How to place about 10 pieces ahead of time
One recommended approach
Less likely to be changed in the gala.
Cannot find a relationship with any of those already placed.
Placed in "if I may say so."
don't take nonsense seriously
Clip of relationship display
Three Principles
Clip between as many labels as possible.
Clips can be placed in the shortest distance possible
Clips crossed as little as possible
similarity
Relationships
Focus on similarity precedes
We don't place them according to a framework.
procedure
fixed framework
Materials collected for the purpose of making
this is not the case
Point of completion of net making
I can't get a clear overall picture.
We are building a net based on ready-made theories and classifications.
The big picture emerges in the integrated diagramming step.
Lens of Meaning
short-range lens
Look at the specific linkage of individual labels
telephoto lens
View each label group in its entirety
round-trip ticket
A Fictional Story
being preoccupied with theory (logic)
I can't see the whole picture.
classificatory type
Clear net shape
Blurred overall view
semantic hand
Means of Inspection
You can't create a net by analyzing it.
The combinations are enormous
A sense of wholeness that the whole sentence appeals to.
Integrated Diagramming
illustration
Making a nameplate
Difference from KJ method
shimadori (Japanese bird, Cynoglossus joyneri)
KJ method
Determined by group composition
Looking for where to put the island ditch
Pre-attached items
first cockcrowing
Two or three labels to enclose
Five at most.
loner
I'm not forcing myself to take an island.
making a table nameplate
We'll do it until we have five or six islands.
It's important to be willing to search for relationships.
Logical island-hopping is difficult
Don't worry about whether the nameplate will be attached before you enclose it.
Bird's eye view of meaning
Looking down from the plane
Immediately after takeoff
house-to-house level
village level
zone level
As the altitude increases, the image naturally appears more coherent.
I'm not going to make it contrived.
It doesn't have to be a sentence.
May be table of contents-like
Review the contents of the island
Grasp the overall sense that the entire contents appeal to you.
In short, what is the point?
In short, it's ~, mumble
predication
Same as KJ method
