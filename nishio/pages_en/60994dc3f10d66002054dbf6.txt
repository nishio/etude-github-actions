When you're trying to convince someone, talk about the benefit, not the reason.
If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason. --- Benjamin Franklin
	Do not bring up any good arguments to persuade the other party. Just talk about how it will benefit them.

	(DeepL) If you want to persuade, appeal to interest, not reason.
	(Google Translate) If you are going to persuade, appeal to interest, not reason.
	(Nishio) When persuading, speak of benefits, not reasons.

The first translation is well circulated in Japan, although the source is not clear.
At this point, machine translation would make interest "interest".
	>(uncountable, finance) The price paid for obtaining, or price received for providing, money or goods in a credit transaction, calculated as a fraction of the amount or value of what was borrowed. `[from earlier 16th c.]`
	>(uncountable) A great attention and concern from someone or something; intellectual curiosity. `[from later 18th c.]`
	Since the meaning of "interest" was just barely there or not at the time Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) lived, it must have had more nuances of interest, money, or profit than the modern intellectual curiosity nuances.
	Maybe reason is more of an "appeal to reason" than a "talk about reason".
