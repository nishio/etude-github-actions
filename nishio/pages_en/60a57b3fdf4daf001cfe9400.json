Motivation of knowledge workers is the same as that of volunteers
[What will govern tomorrow] p.23
>Knowledge workers are motivated by the same motivations that motivate volunteers...
> Volunteers, precisely because they do not get paid,
	>We must get satisfaction from the work itself.
 >They must be given the opportunity to challenge themselves.
 >The mission of the organization must be known and believed to be the best it can be.
 >Must be trained for better jobs.
 >Must be able to understand outcomes
