	[Chatbot] that speaks in [direct quotation model] based on [book corpus].
	BoW-like vector of [keyphrase occurrences] during user input.
 Transpose the matrix W_PK of keyphrase occurrences in the page and multiply by the input
	 The hidden layer has a strong association with the page so far.
 	This layer is Linear
 Multiply the output of the hidden layer by the mapping matrix W_PS between pages and utterances taken from those pages
	That alone is fine, but multiply by the matrix of key phrase occurrences during speech and add them together.
 Softmaxed against it will be the probability of utterance.
