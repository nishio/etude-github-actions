 [Koichi Hori]

	Creative Activity and Artificial Intelligence
 A model of self-organizing systems to explain creative activity support
 	The [geneplore] model of [Finke
  Kai-Suzuki's constraint relaxation model
  [Synergetics] in [Haken].
  Hori's self-organizing system model
  Representation [liquefaction and crystallization].
  	>Liquefaction of expression is the process of breaking down knowledge once solidified at the level of knowledge to create "a bubbling fluid of linguistic 'meaning' energy in varying degrees of intensity.
   	Fluid" is Izutsu's concept of "language araya sense".
   The nebulous world" ([nebulous world], by Hori)
   Talking about the importance of not only crystallizing the fluid, but also the process of converting what is already crystallized back into fluid.
