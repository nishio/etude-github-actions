I want to identify stickies from different sources.
 It's a hassle to write the source for everything.
 Do I stamp the identification ID?
 I looked for a small stamp and found one that looked good.

  10 things can be identified using it as a number alone.
   In addition, multiple digits can be expressed by combining left and right.
  	There's only one of each kind, so I can't express it as 11 or something like that.
   It would suffice as an identifying ID.
		I bought a small red stamp stand [Amazon https://amzn.to/2NvayV3].

	Tried.
 	Sticky notes are written first and lined up
 	You can put it on a stamp stand once and pop-pop it on about 4 sticky notes.
  Much easier than writing marks by hand
