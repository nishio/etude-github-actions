 *1205806291*Chat log for Shibuya.abc#1
 I put it on the Wiki: http://wiki.libspark.org/trac/wiki/Shibuya.abc_1
 I was told "too many links, too much spam" so I replaced http with ttp.

 *1205808171*[Mac]Keybindings for Spaces and such.
 On my MacBook, F3 and F4 are marked Exposé and Dashboard, respectively. I assigned F2 to Desktop View and F5 to Spaces, but I keep making the mistake of having Spaces next to Exposé and Desktop View next to Dashboard, which seems to have less cognitive load.
 
 And I'm dreading not being able to reload the browser with F5, so I changed everything to have a command key.

 I was in tears because I was the only one who couldn't get on the train, while everyone else got on in one shot.

 I could ride! I can ride a bike now!

 Oh, I couldn't calculate the coverage of the views that Django dynamically imports by simply using coverage.py, but it looks like I can work around it with the method described here. I'll try it later.
 
 *1205828571*[Mac]I'm now using CarbonEmacs.
 http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-j.html
 I read the FAQ.
 It says, "How do I use the Option key as a Meta key?" but the page is set to display:none, and even if you hit search and go to that page, you can't find it in the in-page search, which is a mystery.
 
 -----
 The thing I don't like most about the Mac is the lack of a maximize button, but when I installed CarbonEmacs and enlarged the font because it was too small for my eyes, the bottom edge of the window was outside the screen and I couldn't shrink it. I had no choice but to change the font back to the original one.
 
 -----
 I like the idea of having a search field in the help menu and being able to search from within the menu.

 It went like this.

 I disabled Spaces' numeric designation because ^1 and so on clash with Spaces. Also changed ^[Left] to Command+Left.
 
 *1205833455*Python to hit Growl.
 Python Support for Growl
 http://growl.info/documentation/developer/python-support.php
 
 First, download the SDK from Growl Developer Downloads.
 
 http://growl.info/downloads_developers.php
 
 Python is supported by default, so just go into the Bindings/python folder and sudo python setup.py install.
 
 >|python|
 import Growl
 g = Growl.GrowlNotifier(
     applicationName='FindNameError', notifications=['SyntaxError', 'NameError'])
 g.register()
 g.notify(
     noteType='NameError', 
     title='NameError', 
     description='hoge.py line 10.', 
     sticky=False)

 Easy. I wonder if there are any error-like icons that can be used for free.
 
 *1205835109*MacBooks are infectious
 - If you go to a Django study group or something, more than half of the attendees are on MacBooks.
 - Mr. Akatsuka, a Thinkpad user, brings a MacBook (he just bought it, in a box, saying "I just bought it there") to the unexplored alumni camp.
 - coji shows me how convenient it is to have IEEE on a MacBook and how easy it is to share an e-mobile connection.
 - I would buy a MacBook.
 - amachang begins to say, "I like it.
 - amachang will buy MacBooks.
 - ZIGOROu starts saying "I like it, I've been wanting to buy it for a while" ← here and now
 
 *1205840337*[Mac][Python]
 Oh my. It doesn't work if the line feed code is CRLF.
 I get a SyntaxError, so I tried converting it in Emacs with C-Enter f unix and it stopped getting mad.
 
 *1205841568* I could do it.
 Find_name_error.py is now Mac compatible. It's not perfect yet.
 The error was made to appear in Grawl by default. But I have to include Grawl's library.
 When it is not in, it is simply displayed in the console.
 
 Now we need to make sure that users can properly configure these areas.
 
 
 I wonder if I should separate find_name_error.py from coda, which is a killer app for coda (code object analyzer). Also, I might rename it to "failfast.py" or something because of the name (hyphen and underscore are wrong).

 I see, I hadn't thought of the combination of memory for Mac and OEM version of WinXP. That's a good reference.

 I am an amateur with 2 weeks of Mac experience who recently purchased a MacBook. Today a friend bought a MacBook and suddenly reinstalled it and removed CPU Help Files, iWeb, GarageBand, iDVD, iPhoto and iMovie. To his chagrin, please let me know if there are any interesting things I can do with these software. - Human Resource Search Hatena

 They are also being SEO'd with "walking moe elements" (>>)
 
 By the way, I've never read Satrale, should I?
 
 *1205858843* Folding bicycle
 I want a folding bicycle.
 I would like to do something like ride a bike until I get tired and then take a train on the way back.
 
 But from what I saw today, it would be dangerous to ride it on public roads. I might stumble and run out onto the road. I'll have to practice in the park for a while.
 
 Come to think of it, I've had about three accidents on my bicycle, once when I fell asleep at the wheel on the campus of Kyoto University and crashed into someone.

 How to buy genuine brand-name products at discount prices.
 A Gucci bag that cost 10,500 yen can actually be bought for 31,500 yen? No way, that's not true!
