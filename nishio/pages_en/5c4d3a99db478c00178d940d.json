 		I think it is difficult to observe the troubles in familiar relationships flatly because the observed information is probably distorted and I myself have a vested interest in the situation. On the other hand, when Uncle A and Uncle B, who are not important to me, are fighting on the Internet, it is interesting to be able to observe it flatly because I honestly don't care about it. The generation below me will grow up in a situation where they are blessed with the opportunity to observe such cases, so the form of communication may change.
 		In short, Uncle B's pride is hurt (and only B thinks so) by Uncle A's unintentional comment, and B is acting to make "A, the evil one," but only B thinks A is evil.
 		From A's point of view, he doesn't recognize that he said something unintentional and hurt B's pride, so he recognizes that "mad dog B" bit him.
 		From the standpoint of not being on either side of the fence, it looks both ways.
   [Hirotaka Yoshioka] So many problems don't matter, but the people involved don't care, so they can't do anything about it. It is often the case that when you are a party to a problem, you don't care about it.
