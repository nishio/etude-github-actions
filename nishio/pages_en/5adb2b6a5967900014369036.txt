natural
The "natural" is "what distribution your observable sample has.
If the people around you are between 9 and 11 for an attribute, it is "normal to be around 10" and you are surprised when you see someone with 20.
If the people around you are 10, 20, or 30, then "the average is 20, but the swing is large". So I am not surprised to see people with 40.
