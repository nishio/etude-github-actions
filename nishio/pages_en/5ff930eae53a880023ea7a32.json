Depth compression
A simple experiment at home on how depth appears to be compressed when photographed from a distance with a telephoto lens
trick
　Make a row on A4 paper with batteries as appropriate, making it feel like you're far enough away.
　Keep the camera about 5 times farther away than A4.
　You should be at an angle close to horizontal that doesn't change the height of your head too much.
　The subject doesn't have to be the entire screen, because I'll crop it.

　In human terms, they appear to be close enough to touch backs, but

　In fact, they're pretty far apart.
　Hiding the feet makes it even easier to misunderstand.

Why this happens.

　Since depth cannot be determined from a two-dimensional image, humans estimate depth by the ratio of the sizes of the person in front and the person in the back.
　But this size ratio is determined not by the difference in depth itself, but by the ratio of the difference in depth to the distance from the viewpoint
　　Even with the same ratio, the farther away the viewpoint is, the greater the difference in depth.
　In the case of the naked eye of a living person, when a person is far away, the image in the eye is also smaller
　　But when you take a picture with a camera and zoom in, the estimation of the distance to that subject is not good enough.
　　If I could see his face, I'd think "close enough to see his face".
　　As a result, the distance between the people in the front and the people in the back is also short and misunderstood
