 *1438752646*Speaker at the Unexplored Research Group Kickoff
 The "Unexplored Research Group Kickoff" was held on August 4, from 6:00 p.m. at the 5F exchange facility of the Daibiru in Akihabara. People gathered to capacity and had a very intense time.
 
 Mr. Arakawa, a member of the board of directors, began by explaining how the "Unexplored Research Group" works. The "Unexplored Research Group" is an attempt to function as a hub to connect creative people inside and outside of the Unexplored Organization by creating various working groups based on the interests of the organization's members. I think it is very important that the policy of being open to creative people outside the association, rather than being closed to the Unexplored Society, was explicitly stated. I am looking forward to the future as they are planning to hold development camps and other events.
 
 Next, Mr. Koike (<a href='http://www.plus-add.com/'>Plusadd</a> Corporation) of the 2010 main body introduced the working group on the theme of "entrepreneurship. I sympathize with the direction that not everyone should start a business, but it is not good to be overly fearful due to lack of knowledge, so that entrepreneurship can be considered as one of the possible means to be taken. The point of view that Mr. Nakayama pointed out, "I was invited to a venture business, but should I change jobs or not?
 
 Next, Mr. Ukai (2011), Mr. Yasukawa (2012), and Mr. Suzuki (2013) introduced various "programming education" activities. I have also been involved in IPA's Security and Programming Camp, and I see that many of the unexplored creators are involved in such projects related to programming education. I thought it was very important to make horizontal connections and exchange knowledge gained from each project in order to improve programming education in Japan.
 
 I spoke about the working group on "Productivity Improvement. Among the various means of productivity improvement, this time I focused on "productivity improvement through knowledge," which seemed to be related to the discussion of the Programming Education WG on "how to create educational opportunities. It was unexpected, but I am glad that we were able to have a positive impact on each other.

 Finally, Dr. Takeuchi introduced what he has been working on recently and gave information about the <a href='http://prosym.github.io/sprosym2015/'>Summer Programming Symposium 2015</a>. He said that this year's prosin will be development camp style.
 
 After leaving the venue, about 20 people rushed to the after-party, where they engaged in lively and intensive communication. I think some interesting "buds" were born that will lead to the future as far as I was able to observe. I look forward to seeing these buds grow and bear fruit. I will do my best to support them!
