 In the middle of the story, we suddenly started talking about "Genius, Bullet Kogai," and I was blown away by the terrible things that were said in the first exchange.
 
 The content of the book is about what the mass media doesn't say and the atmosphere in the world where people are not allowed to question it. It is a lighthearted book that says a lot of things in a lighthearted manner. It's a light-hearted book that is easy to read because it's not too formal. It is not too formal and easy to read, but it is a book that says that raising property taxes would be a good idea, that the top media leaders are all former communists, that when you say natto (fermented soybeans) is bad, they say "but it's good for your health," which is not an argument, and that Mochio Umeda is nothing more than a "web guy"? I know more about the Web than you do." "It's not that I think Japanese IT is a shame, but that it's a waste of time because it's moving too fast without looking at the world," "I wonder if you haven't had a sex life at age 32 (by Horie to Nishimura).
 
 Well, there are times when you go out for a drink with several people who have various experiences that you don't have, and it is interesting just to hear them talk, even if you are not talking directly to them. It's like that. I felt that Hollimon is an interesting person, and my liking for him has increased.
 
 But I wonder if I've been poisoned by the rotten girl's poison that "Holliemon x Hiroyuki" looks like a coupling...
 
 *1255102447*Picture design
 It's hard to explain what it means to create a picture mathematically. They say, "Are you thinking about it?" They say, "Are you thinking about it? But mathematics is particularly abstract, so it is difficult to explain to someone who does not have the same knowledge how you think and create a picture. But if we talk about making a picture from genome information, it might be easier to explain because it is a little more concrete. Let's give it a try.
 
 Suppose we want to create a picture from genomic information. Well, let's say we use data from the Y chromosome or the SRY gene that determines that a male is male. There are an infinite number of ways to convert this data into a two-dimensional picture. One creative option is, of course, to think about what it means for a man to be a man, and to think of a color scheme or arrangement that evokes a sense of masculinity, but there is also the direction of expression that says, "No, such things are just for decoration; what determines that a man is a man is an inorganic series of information. What determines a man is a series of inorganic information. I would choose the latter. When expressed in black and white, the amount of information per nucleotide is 2 bits. If the genome data were displayed as it is, it would look like a sandstorm. However, the regions that code proteins code amino acids in units of three bases, so each block of three bases has meaning, and there should be a difference between the regions that code proteins and those that do not. If the difference is not recognized by the human eye in a recognizable form, it would not be a picture. What would be the percentage? Let's find out. Let's try to write a little test. etc.
 
 After writing the code, if I feel that I can roughly follow this policy, I write the code. In this process, major problems are sometimes uncovered and corrected.
 
 That is what I am thinking about when I make these slides. As I was writing this, I was thinking that this is similar to making slides for a presentation. I collect data, consider whether the data can be used to express my argument (in this case, "human genetic information is beautiful"), and think about how I can visualize the data in a way that is easy to understand (for general slides, I would draw a pie chart or bar graph, etc.).
 
 *1255111546*Colds and dry rubbing
 I know it's true that swimming in a pool is better for you, but it's not something you'd let someone with a cold do.
 Dry friction might make you less likely to catch a cold, but you shouldn't let someone with a cold do it.
 All a person with a cold has to do is get fluids, nutrition, and proper rest without rushing into activity, right?
 
 Of course a healthy person should not tell a person with a cold to "get in the pool," but it is a mistake for a person with a cold to mistakenly think that he or she has to do it too or to get angry and say, "There is no way I can do it," when it is spoken to the masses, not to a specific individual. You should at least judge for yourself that the words are not directed at you.
