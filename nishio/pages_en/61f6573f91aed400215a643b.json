If you push what is right to the extreme, it is wrong

>Discharge everything into the dregs, neither good nor evil.
>Drain Nothing to the Dregs, neither Good nor Ill.
This dreg is the "lees" that settles under a liquid such as wine. However, I am not sure what you are trying to say with this title.
ã€€Does it mean that even a good wine tastes bad with it's sediments?

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
If you push what is right to the extreme, it is wrong

Exhaust nothing, neither good nor evil, but everything to dregs.

A wise man once reduced all virtues to a golden mean. If you push what is right to the extreme, it is wrong. If you squeeze all the juice out of an orange, it becomes bitter. Never go to extremes, even for pleasure. If your thoughts are too sensitive, they will become insensitive. If you milk a cow too much, it will bleed instead of milk.
