Mysterious behavior when 1T pulse is put into comparator
If the micra comparator is looped, the signal strength is maintained with a 1-tick delay in the comparator portion, and the signal strength drops by 1 with no delay in the powder portion. However, if you put a 1-tick pulse in this, it will decay and disappear in the continuous part of the comparator.
It does not occur at more than 2 ticks.
Verified by JE1.17.1.

If you put a 1-tick signal in the observer, it stops in the middle of the signal.

If it's more than two ticks, it's seven and a half laps.

	>Redstone comparators typically do not respond to changes in signal strength of one tick.
