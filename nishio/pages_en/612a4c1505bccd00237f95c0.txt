Open Graph Image as a Service
https://og-image.vercel.app/

I'm giving Puppeteer the HTML and taking screenshots.
	We have to wait for that HTML to access the Firestore to read and render the data.
	Since access to the Firestore runs asynchronously after loading, there is no way to wait for it...

			Option on the Puppeteer side to wait until all network connections stop.

　I'm generating HTML as a string and setContent.
　　This is going to be tough to connect with Kozaneba.
　　Seems like a good idea to separate it as a service and do it in GOTO.

	Even if the meta tags of a page are configured to be rewritten by JS after page load, crawlers of various social networking services cannot handle it.
	You have to serve HTML on the server side.
	I can use vercel to create minimal HTML with individual meta's on the server side and spit it out...
