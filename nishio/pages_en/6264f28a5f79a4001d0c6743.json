People who brag are dissatisfied
I think people who [boast] are [dissatisfied].

How it started [Facebook https://www.facebook.com/hiromi.okuda/posts/4918750451494278]
>[Hiromi Okuda] I blocked a middle-aged man who writes "I have money and I have young girls as samurai. With a statement of intent, "I am displeased."
>[Hirotaka Yoshioka] He is terrible. You are a person who doesn't make sense. What kind of mental structure do you have? I can't help asking Mr. Okuda, "What kind of mental structure do you have? I beg your pardon.
I was wondering and thinking about this question, "What kind of mental structure?"

A hypothesis that came to mind
　People who brag are dissatisfied
　[https://gyazo.com/a121fca4612830aa0ac5ce4172408373]
 　I am not satisfied (= dissatisfied) with a certain X
 　I can't close this gap and I don't want to face it directly.
 　　One way to achieve this "is to paste X and a similar Y together and interpret them as a whole as being above the expectation line."
　　There are two types of people: the type who, after repeating this, no longer know the difference between X and Y themselves, and the type who are still aware that they are "forcibly equating X and Y".
　　Those who are aware that they are "forcibly equating X and Y" are worried about whether others will notice their trick, so they send out the message "I'm amazing" and seek the approval of others.
　　　I feel "proud" when I don't feel satisfied with this transmission.

People in the world don't equate X and Y as much as he thinks they do.
　When I see middle-aged men who say, "I have money, so I have young girls as my lady-in-waiting," my feeling is, "I have money, so I have young girls as my lady-in-waiting.
　　1: The story summarized in this issue
　　 In other words, people who don't work for money don't sit by your side."
　　 This person feels negatively about that."
　　 But you turn a blind eye to it."
　　2: Another side (statement is self explanatory)
　　 "This is a self-introduction: 'I'm happy when I pay a young woman to be my samurai.'"
