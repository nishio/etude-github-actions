　I thought, "Well, that makes sense," so I imitated him.
　At first it was just UserScript, but now CSS has been added, and now it's a set of icons as well, so I don't think the name is appropriate.
　I wonder if renaming won't break links from other projects?

When I had a face icon on "my page," I didn't think much of the fact that every time I edited the code, a big card with my face on it would come up.
　I couldn't verbalize the discomfort, but it was psychological resistance to "something coming up that I didn't want you to see.
　I changed the face icon and it's a little more comfortable.
　As for this project, I pinned it and erased it with CSS.
