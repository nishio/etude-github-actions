False dichotomy
[https://gyazo.com/28a9fcc66cdc83f41ba2a74fc67bd954]

Mr. A thinks X and Y are in conflict and "distant"
But Mr. B thinks that X and Y are close, that there is a Z that opposes them.

concrete example
　[Mandatory regular leave also low discretionary status].
　　A" counterposes "thorough implementation of no-overtime day X" with "forced overtime work condition Y" of a black company.
　　B counterposes discretionary work Z with no fixed hours, which both X and Y see as "a state of being deprived of discretion over when to work".
　I don't want to live, but I don't want to die either."
　　Mr. A believes it is a dichotomy between "wanting to live" and "wanting to die."
　　Mr. B says, "I don't want to die," "I don't want to live," and "I just want to go away."
　　　Dichotomy of "wanting to be active" and "not wanting to be active"
　　　I recognize that both "living" and "dying" are active actions.

Q: What is the relationship to [false dichotomy]?
　The point about the "false dichotomy" implicitly assumes the existence of a boundary, which begs the question, "Is there really a boundary?" I get the sense that you're asking the question, "Are there really boundaries?
　The "false dichotomy" doesn't negate the original conflict itself.
　　There is an additional axis of conflict.
　　It's like you're telling someone who implicitly sees the original conflict as a "big one" that it's a small conflict and there's a bigger one.
　　　Maybe it's subjective whether it's big or not.

relevance
　[Conflict is a close relationship] in [there is more than one conflict].
