(5.1) Is there too much information or too little?
Suppose you need to write a report and you are wondering what you should write.

What is the reason that you can not write? 

	You do not have enough information to write.
	You have too much information to determine what to write.

These two states are the opposite. First of all, we need to identify which state you are.

For the purpose, there is a useful method, "[to write all out]" method.
