　Thoughts.
　　Known to be minimum cut entanglement
　　Buying an item or not is a choice between two options, so it makes the cut.
　　Can you solve a problem that maximizes a ratio with a minimum cut?
　　　Bicubic search with ratio maximization as a decision problem?

　　How would you describe the experience that is gained when multiple items are all purchased?
　　　First, experience is a gain, so make it a "loss if you didn't buy one of several items".

　　If "not bought" is in the red, then the purchase cost is honestly on the side.
　　The experience side is the sum of all experience values E minus the actual experience value e [$ E - e].
　Transforming the ratio equation, let e be the experience value and c the purchase cost.
　	[$ e/c > X]
　	[$ e > cX]
　	[$ e - cX > 0]
　	[$ cX - e < 0]
  If the left side is negative when minimized, it means the ratio can be greater than X.
　	[$ cX + E - e < E]
  That is, the cost side is multiplied by X. If the cost of the cut is less than E when the minimum cut is obtained, the ratio can be greater than X.
