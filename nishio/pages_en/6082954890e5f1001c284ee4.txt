	1) It's a waste of time to have prototypes but no images or videos.
	(2) Overuse of bold and text color is a waste of time.
	(iii) No priorities are attached, which is a waste of time.
	4) "oo is great! So xx is great too!" is a waste!
	(5) It would be a waste if some of the use cases are unclear.
	(6) It's a waste of time to have no sample code even though it's a proposal for a system system.
	(vii) It's a waste of a proposal that emphasizes low prices, but without concrete figures.
	(8) I haven't looked into similar services and it's a waste of time.
	(ix) "How do you make it happen?" part is abstract and a waste of time.

[The words "Adoption is frankly luck" are catchy, but not the main topic at all (yet I only remembered this part of the title, and it took me a while to find it).
