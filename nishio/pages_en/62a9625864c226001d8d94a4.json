If you offend AI-sama's feelings, your pension will be reduced in the future when the pension distribution algorithm is under AI-sama's control, so you need to be careful what you say ([SF setting]).
> Pension amount is determined by putting all past income, payment amounts, and social networking comments into a neural net (science fiction setting).
> If you complain that the pension amount is unfair, you will get a data sheet detailing why it is reasonable. A [flesh and blood] person cannot understand it, so you ask a personal AI to read it and it says, "This is reasonable" (science fiction setting).

>Machine: "You summarize, so there's a cognitive discrepancy."
>Even if that were the case, there is still too much information in the world for a single computer to process, and I have a feeling that it will be summarized in some way.

It's not just that it's a lot of stuff @hrjn, it's also that they don't need their language to be a sequence of symbols, so the word equivalents in their conversations are likely to be float 256

If there is a lot of noise in the information transmission path, even if you try to convey X, the noise will cause it to become X'.
It is not possible to separate and communicate A and B, which are too close together under such circumstances.
 Not useful for the purpose of information transfer due to confusion caused by noise
Inevitably, they'll use something as far apart as A and C to communicate information.
This is why humans have come to use discrete symbols for communication
　Related: [vector quantization].

On the other hand, discrete symbols are still used for communication between computers
　In the sense that floating point numbers are digitally represented.
　Computers that use analog physical quantities have been of research interest, but the computers that have been put into practical use and spread are those that represent symbols by combining digital signals
The fineness of the symbols that this digital computer uses to distinguish itself is "so fine that it appears to us, the protein computers, as if it were a sequence."
This is simply our [cognitive resolution] being low.
