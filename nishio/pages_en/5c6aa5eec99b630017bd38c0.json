	When a certain technology X is highly valued
 	Technicians who have not mastered X can learn X by
 		I think it will help me in my future.
 		I think my [market value] will go up.
 	Therefore, there is a bias to select technology X when choosing the technology to use for the project
 		You can learn Technology X on the job time by being involved in that project.
 		I think putting my involvement in a project that uses technology X on my resume would increase my market value.
 	On the other hand, technicians who have already mastered X
 		Make technology selection based on whether it is beneficial to use technology X for that project.
 		If it is not beneficial to use technology X, then say, "I would prefer not to use technology X."
 		Do not like to see their time spent learning technology X wasted on projects that should not use technology X
 		Unwillingness to participate in a project if technology X is about to be used when technology X should not be used

relevance
	[Hype cycle]
		If someone who has mastered technology X thinks technology X is overvalued, they might consider selling it at a higher price to someone who wants technology X before it is devalued.
