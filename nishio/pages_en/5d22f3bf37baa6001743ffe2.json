Sticky should remember the source.

	We need to be able to integrate other people's thoughts as well.
	Copyright law allows you to pour other people's work into this system if it is for private use.
		Only if you don't disclose it.
	On the other hand, I want to publish the map I made to others.
		I don't want to be able to see other people's work that I've imported by tracing it from a published map.
		It is not a good idea to be hesitant about importing because you are worried about this
			Just like private Evernote, you should be able to clip more and more, whether it's someone else's work or not.
		Other people's work should be flagged on import.
		A sticky note extracted from someone else's work would fully satisfy the citation requirement if the source of the quote is clearly stated.
		As long as the source is recorded.
		There will be cases, such as books that you own the copyright to.
			The "source will be indicated" and "the original text should not be indicated because it is someone else's work" are two different flags.
			It would be nice to see a list of "sources that exist" included in it when it is published.
				If it was just a quote from my book, then you can publish it with no problem.
				If it includes someone else's book or other material, a human being will determine if it is appropriate as a citation.
				If it contains, for example, the contents of a secret chat, delete it and then publish it.
