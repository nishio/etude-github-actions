価値観の言語化
At [CUMOT2018], I was asked, "It's amazing that you can verbalize what you feel [value] in your life. How can I do it?". At first, of course, I was not able to verbalize it, but even in that state, "feelings" such as "this is fun and interesting" and "this is not fun and interesting imho" occur. If you pay attention to this and gather information about what you find interesting, you will see it later.

The [verbalization] of [values] happens [after the fact].

[Values are verbalized bottom-up].
[values are verbalized after the fact].
