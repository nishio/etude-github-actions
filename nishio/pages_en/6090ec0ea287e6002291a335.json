 To add to this, there is no mention of gatekeepers in the book "Organizational Patterns," but they are introduced as a pattern in the "Generative Development Process Pattern Language" by the same author. The term "gatekeepers" is also used in Allen's 1969 article in this column. The bibliography of "Generative Development Process Pattern Language" mentions Allen's 1977 paper.
