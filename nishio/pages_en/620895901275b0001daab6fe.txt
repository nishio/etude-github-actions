Experience is multi-schematic, diary is temporal scheme
[Experience] is [multischematic], [diary] is [one-dimensional] [temporal scheme].
　PS: Schema or [scheme] or shaky and not good. Meaning something like "structure."
　　I thought about unifying it with "structure," but then I'd lose the connection to this
　　>When symbolizing experience, the scheme is not one way, it is a multi-scheme multischematic.

　　I'll try my best to describe "multi-scheme-like" in Japanese as "any number of possible forms."

Being one-dimensional, I can concentrate on getting what is in my mind out in the form of letters, without [decision-making] "where shall I write" or "what structure shall I use? Because there is only one "place to write now."

On the other hand, it can only be withdrawn in [time scheme] when it is used.
This means that [a paper diary] would only allow a "look before and after" access pattern.
With the slightly ingenious paper diary "[10 Year Diary]", you can speedily access "n years ago today".
If you keep a diary as [searchable] digital text, another scheme is mechanically generated that says, "Documents in which a common string appears are related. Let's call it the [string co-occurrence scheme].

Scrapbox-like bracketing of diary-like writing is to explicitly assign a string co-occurrence scheme to something that was once written out along a time axis. The only difference is that the co-occurrence is judged as "explicitly bracketed" rather than "full text".
Scrapbox is easy because there is no need to "create" categories and tags in advance.

The ability for readers to change the sort order of the Scrapbox home page is a multi-scheme feature. I don't know how many people make use of this feature...
For example, if they are ordered by creation date, this would be the same scheme as a diary or [blog].

Scrapbox implicitly records the date and time when a page is created and can be viewed at any time. It is not displayed in a conspicuous place.
Instead, the "title" is in a prominent place, and this title connects to the links in the rest of the text.
