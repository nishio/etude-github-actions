Intellectual Production and Scrapbox
 I tried incremental writing in supermemo, which at the time of writing last summer I was not yet as familiar with [Scrapbox] as I am now.
 How did you come to love Scrapbox?
 Scrapbox itself is explained more than enough in "[Scrapbox Information Organizing Techniques]", and it is not the purpose of this book to introduce specific tools and techniques, it is a means # not an end
 The introduction of "specific tools and techniques" is a means to an end: finding more universal principles by comparing them with others.
	So if I were to write about Scrapbox, I would have to talk about the advantages and disadvantages compared to something similar
 There is nothing specific to speak to its use as a CMS.
 For one-person use, the comparison would be the KJ method on paper, which I am currently doing, and incremental writing in supermemo. For use by multiple people, the comparison would be e-mail and chat as means of communication, and file sharing and wikis as methods of information sharing.
 Software that is used by multiple people to support intellectual production is, in other words, groupware. [CSCW]
