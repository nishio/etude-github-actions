Bug or Ability.
Q: Is [placebo] a bug or a human ability?
A:
	Okay, I thought that was like saying that Super Mario's infinite growth is a bug or [ability].
 The system first assumes that a certain behavior is "[ideal]" as the behavior of the system.
 Call it a "[bug]" when the actual behavior deviates from the ideal.
 This means that "bugs are [subjective]" because whether they are bugs or not depends on what you consider to be ideal.
 If the ideal is not assumed in advance, then "the system behaves this way?" comes first, and then "then I can produce a favorable result if I do this. This is a useful [hack].

	People seem to be bitter about hacks against the social system. Like, "It's a cheat to exploit a bug in society!" Like that.
 Even if the specifications are not ideal, they may be maintained by someone who finds it convenient to keep them.

	[human bug].
