Instantaneous and Sustained Action
[https://gyazo.com/e599cff325c5b39ecdc26c5b5b74873c]
The story of "people who thought they had the ability to take action are surprisingly inactive when you take a closer look," illustrates that there are at least two things that are described by the word "action.

The "instantaneous large output" on the left can make a large move in an environment where that output can overcome a barrier by "overcoming the barrier -> rolling with the flow".
However, this movement pattern would result in a "move a little → cheat back" in an environment such as the one on the right.
The arrow on the right shows the opposite pattern: "keep pushing in one direction without being discouraged, even when going uphill or into a headwind.

Should be thought of as "how strong is the action," not "how strong is/is not the action." ref. [False dichotomy].
Both patterns of activity can be overcome if they are strong enough.
 For example, let's consider a baseline of "people who have just barely enough sustained activity to go to work every day" and "people who want to go to English conversation school but are languishing.
  Those with "sustained energy who can attend an English conversation school on their way home" can make the choice to attend without any problems, especially if they want to go.
  People with spontaneous action tend to apply first without thinking about whether or not they can attend, and then they try to do something about it.

In short, there are two ways to achieve results (to go far): "Keep pushing [against the headwinds]" and "No, just throw it out there and let it happen! and let things take their course," and people who are "bored" can only do the latter.

　It's a good name, so I adopted it for the page title.

	As I was writing this, I was thinking that the right type of arrow could cross the environmental barrier on the left.
	[kuboon.icon] The left uphill is steeper than the right.

			>Then it's hard to quantify the ability of the left side, the thickness of the wall to smash through?
			>I liked the first diagram better because it gave the sense of "when you blurt out something with high spontaneous energy, the people around you get involved and things go their own way even if they are demotivated".
		[nishio.icon] Well, I think "hit the wall" and "accelerated enough to go over the wall momentarily" are just different ways of describing the same phenomenon.

It is highly likely that people differ in whether they perceive the environment to the left as "common" or "rare".

Mr. Tachikawa said, "Even in the right environment, don't you need to be able to act instantaneously at first?" So I thought about it, and the result is that the ball that's stopped feels like it's dizzying.

	Oh, I think I might have figured it out. If you think about going to a particular place you want to go, the odds that you can get there just by accidentally rolling are low and of the right type.
 If you want to move anywhere, just pop out of the hollow and you will roll somewhere, so it will be on the left.
 Maybe the difference is that the rolling ball has a destination.

Another expression
	[kuboon.icon] I think the one on the right is called [GRIT].
