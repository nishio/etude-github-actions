There are reasons not to do it and reasons to do it.
When one person thinks there is a reason not to do something, often another thinks there is a reason to do it.
There are those who see the same thing and see reasons not to do it and those who see reasons to do it. The former will be [laggard].

>[ogochan https://twitter.com/ogochan/status/1381927830833926145]: ah, what is to come has come.
>This is Japan. Unfortunately.
>Chinese-made EVs to hit Japan in earnest: Sagawa Express adopts 7200 vehicles: Nikkei.com/article/DGXZQO...

>[backyardsjp https://twitter.com/backyardsjp/status/1381930197247696896]: you can rest assured it will only result in as much discredit as you can drop. Just think about why Toyota wouldn't do an easy EV if they wanted to.

>[ogochan https://twitter.com/ogochan/status/1381930796248834049]: ah, I heard these words on my computer and on my phone.
>In the world of technology, those who fail first get to the top.
>[ogochan https://twitter.com/ogochan/status/1381940238642151429]: "Good reasons not to do it" are as many as people who don't do it can come up with. But people who do can come up with just as many "good reasons to do it".
>In the world of technology, it is easier to accumulate a lot of know-how by doing things early and making mistakes early, regardless of whether or not you are successful.
>[ogochan https://twitter.com/ogochan/status/1381941547722186760]: Of course Sagawa is expecting a mountain of obstacles to come up. But since they put so much into the project, they can't withdraw so easily, so the obstacles will be solved one by one. They probably did what they did because they had a mutually agreeable settlement point. That's what it means to take a chance on something new.
>[ogochan https://twitter.com/ogochan/status/1381942936326205447]: i.e., something came up that went beyond the "risk/benefit equilibrium point". Something that erased the "reasons why Toyota wouldn't do it."
>Sagawa has put up a lot of money. It's not like hobbyists buying on the spur of the moment.
>[ogochan https://twitter.com/ogochan/status/1381943954258546691]: Well, you know, you can't help but think, "Are you okay?
>But in their outlook, they've crossed the "equilibrium point". That's quite an accomplishment.

So, in the end, there are those who look at the same thing and see "reasons not to do it" and those who see "reasons to do it"? The former will be laggard.
