Unification of close symbols
The "unification of close symbols" is an important phenomenon in the process of Scrapbox and Kozaneba's [understanding] of users.

Example in Scrapbox
　Create a page to write about a certain subject.
　　It shows that a page with the same title already exists and asks if you want to merge it.
　　　Suggests "single identical symbol."
　　　Users can single out the pages or write them out anyway without singling them out and then compare the two pages
　　　　Often the titles of the older pages are ambiguous and should be changed to titles more in line with the content.
　　　　This is because "what was not yet clearly articulated in the language when the old page was written" has been clarified by matching it with the new page.
　　　　　Related [There are three patterns in direct matching results].

　Trying to clip a certain content X
　　Give a certain title Y
　　Search on the content you are about to clip, or paste the content you are about to clip and bracket part of it, and discover that the content has already been clipped as a result
　　So far, there has been no link Y to X, but I can see that there should be, and there is.

Kozaneba Example
	[https://gyazo.com/ddc91e6448121794e81d5d84d9a73575]

　Read while kozanizing the text
　Notice the repeated use of long, one-word phrases.
　It is unlikely that the long phrases coincide by chance, so it is clear that they are using that long phrase as a single symbol
　I was in the process of kozanizing a sentence when I came across a statement like "X, that is, Y.
 　This is a statement that symbol X and symbol Y are used in almost the same sense
 　By connecting this "relationship" with a double line to make it explicit, we can see that the subsequent reading of the text is almost identical to the other symbol for both XY occurrences
