　[When we say "information network," the word "network" tends to conjure up an image of a form without branches and leaves, as shown in the figure on the left.
　But in reality, a tree with branches and leaves is closer to reality.
　　[After the fact, you realize, "Oh, this one and this one are related! and then you connect them and it becomes "something that is not strictly a tree.
　　[I notice the relationship after the fact.]
　So is the process of creating [mind maps].
　　First, [write down] what [associates] with the central theme in the form of "[extending branches]".
　　Then add links between related branches to connect them.
　Scrapbox also does not have to try to create a network like the one on the left from the start.
　　If you put a link to one existing page on a newly used page, it can be connected to the "tree" as a "branch and leaf".
　　Then, two hops ahead are displayed, prompting the user to realize, "Oh, this has something to do with that! The network is then developed after the fact.
