position
	To "take a position" means to articulate and advocate one's position or viewpoint on a topic, issue, event, or market.
	The term is commonly used in the business and financial worlds, especially in investing. An investor may take a buy or sell position in a particular stock or asset class in the market. This is done with the goal of making a profit by predicting future price increases or decreases.
	Taking a position can also clarify one's position on an event or issue. A person or group may take a position on a political or social issue. This allows them to present a particular position or way of thinking and prepare for discussion and negotiation with those involved.
