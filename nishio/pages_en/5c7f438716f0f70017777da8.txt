Ambiguous PoC
What kind of concept will be proven by doing what we call [PoC] (Proof of Concept)?
If this is not clear, isn't it inappropriate to call a PoC a "PoC" in the first place?

The "AI could improve business operations in a good way" is ambiguous and cannot be judged objectively.
The question "If we use RandomForest, could we predict indicator X?" is also vague as to "How accurate should we be able to predict it?".
It is clear and objective that "Using RandomForest, indicator X can be predicted with a 95% probability of error Â±10%."
But there is a deep valley between "predictable" and "business improvement".
