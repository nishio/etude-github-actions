	2 [summarize state].
	　[DP speeds up all searches].
	　　Speeding up the process by equating states
	　　Conditions that can be summarized
	　　　Same destination state
	　　　The coefficients on the transitions are the same.
	　　　All of the summarized states either meet or do not meet the conditions of the problem statement.

 3 [Change search order].
  3.1 [sorted by size].
   [AOJ2333]
  3.2 [permutation is insert DP].
   When determining permutations in DP, it is necessary to keep track of "what has already been used".
   　If it is small, you can use [bit DP].
   Instead of doing it in order, do it in ascending/descending order of what you put in.
  3.3 [Section sorted by endpoint].
 4 [paraphrase of condition].
 　[more operations, less products].
 5 Return from greedy
 　Find the number of columns that may be created by an operation" is difficult when the same column is created by multiple operation columns
 　It would be easier to count if there was a way to uniquely determine the operation sequence from the product.
 6 Techniques for Case Segregation
 　Case by parameter
 　　Be careful to DISJOINT
 　[AGC013D]
 7 [Decomposition into linear sums].
  It's close to what I call [change order of operations].
  [Decompose bitwise operations into digits].
 8 [subgroup] techniques
  [operation is reversible and the whole area → subgroup]
 　[Lagrange's theorem]
 　Predicting the number of invariants
 　　If it's even, it's likely to have even-odd invariants.
 9 Use of recursive definitions
 　Works well with DP [recursive definition -> DP].
 　[ARC037D]
 10 About [digit DP
  [AOJ0570]
 11 Acceleration Techniques
  11.1 Use of [cumulative sum
  11.2 Use of Data Structures
   [Fenik Wood]
  11.3 Array usage
  11.4 [Fast Fourier Transform].
  　[NTT]
  11.5 [Fast zeta transformation].
   Can be used for operations that satisfy the coupling and exchange laws
  11.6 [Convolution of And and Add].
  　Algorithm similar to [Fast Fourier Transform
  11.7 Simple branch trimming
 12 Techniques with Matrices 26
  12.1 [Binary powers of two].
  　[AGC013E]
  　Power of the companion matrix
  　Power of polynomial
  12.2 Matrix Expression Techniques
  　[matrix tree theorem]
  　　[Number of trees in the whole area]
  　[LGV Official]
  　　[Number of non-intersecting paths]
  　https://www.ioi-jp.org/camp/2017/2017-sp_camp-kumabe2.pdf
 13 [Ignore small probabilities] 29
 14 Binomial coefficient technique 30
  14.1 Collection of frequently used formulas
  	[Binomial coefficient formula]
  14.2 Return to [number of routes
  　Attributing binomial coefficients to the number of paths makes it easy to transform the equation
  14.3 [45-degree rotation].
  　[divide into X and Y].
  14.4 [Catalan number].
 15 [Inclusion-Description Principle] 33
  15.1 When symmetry is used
  	[AGC005D]
  15.2 Using DP
  15.3 [Inclusion of the divisor in the divisor system].
  	[ARC064F]
 16 Identifying "unsolvable problems
