Metaphor of finding issues
 I think the [metaphor] of "[discovery]" in the assignment is not appropriate, as it seems to suggest that from a completely unknown zero, you might discover something that will lead to a hundred.
  #Finding issues
 Many people don't have the experience of discovery, but I'm not sure they would get the analogy to discovery.

 Many people are thinking, "This is not good..." but what exactly is not good about it [verbalization] is not being done, and the work is to take the time to verbalize it.
 This is what is required prior to the "[issue resolution]" phase
 It's never "just something you come up with by accident."

	[Discovery may be the wrong word.]
