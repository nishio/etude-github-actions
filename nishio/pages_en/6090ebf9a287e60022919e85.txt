 *1217204813* April Fool's Day
 Oh shit, I totally forgot it's April Fool's Day! I haven't prepared anything!
 
 
 I thought that, but today is August 1. I was sleepy.
 
 
 I dreamed that I wrote in my diary.
 
 *1217243368*Emacs to Eclipse
 I was told that I should use an IDE with a completion function to compress the time I spend looking up the contents of an ostringstream as a string in C++, but since I cannot use Visual Studio on my Mac, I installed Eclipse CDT.
 
 Ctrl+. will also work, like Emacs' dynamic abbreviation completion!
 
 I'm going to try this for a while, and TopCoder too.
 
 *1217260512*[1000speakers] Preparations are underway for the 6th @ Kyushu
 This time, I am nishio, who is on the sidelines as you said in "Sustainability of Event Things - Obinata's Hatena Diary" (http://d.hatena.ne.jp/earth2001y/20080622/p1).
 
 But it is no use, since the venue is in Nagasaki, so I can't just casually go and visit the venue. So, when I was on the sidelines, I noticed some things that I did not notice when I was doing it by myself. For example, the number of people. Up until now, the number of participants has been 30. When you are the organizer, by making changes, you avoid taking risks that you would not have to take if you had done things the same way. I don't even realize that I am avoiding the risk. When asked, "The venue is bigger this time, do you want to have more people? If the venue is too small for 30 people, you might as well increase the number of people. I wonder if it is because I am relieved to be able to say that. It is interesting.
 
 This is exactly why I am against franchising. I am not at all confident that the way we have been doing things is the best way. We are in a phase where we need to find a better method through trial and error. We are not in a position to compile a manual and hand it over to the descent style. The best method should change depending on the location of the event. I think the right thing to do would be for everyone to go through trial and error and collect examples of "this is why we did this" or "this is how it turned out.
 
 
 Well, the reason I wrote this entry is because I wanted to link to an interesting conversation that took place in chat the other day before I forget.

 To summarize, "the current application process is too complicated," and although amachang had already told me that it would be a hassle to create a Wiki account, I had been opposed to the idea because there are various reasons for asking people to create an account.
 
 - Why Wiki?
 -- There should be a place for participants to write their profiles in advance
 -- there should be a place where presenters can post their presentation materials and links after their presentation.
 --- Easy to manage if the presenter rewrites it himself.
 -- I prefer that first time attendees know what it was like before.
 - Why Wiki is account-based
 -- Because bots will troll (true story)
 -- Can collect email addresses in a form that cannot be seen by third parties (but has never been needed).
 - Why the application is a chat
 -- first-come, first-served is clear.
 - Problems with chatting about the application.
 -- It gets complicated in the chat logs. Is there still a slot?" becomes a FAQ.
 - Why the application is not in the comments section of the blog
 -- Because of the flood of applications for the first round of applications, it was very difficult. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/amachang/20071211/1197350279
 --- but this could be mainly because we didn't have a set number of people.
 
 But the other day, in your message, I realized that even if the final amount of writing is the same, I can lower the threshold for application by simply switching the order. It was an eye-opener. Why didn't I notice this before?

 Yup. The procedure is a pain in the ass when it comes to securing a slot.
 At the very least, we should be in the process of creating an account after the participation is confirmed.

 He said that the threshold for the first step must be low to go there.

 And well, that's why for the time being I would like to be "1000speakers" for everyone. I think the more brains we have, the better chance we have of coming up with good ideas.
