Thoughts.
　I want to replace two adjacent columns of numbers with a product to maximize the number of times to get to a single digit.
　　PS: Wrong problem condition, sum, not product
　Do you want to avoid conversions that reduce the number of digits as much as possible?
　The whole thing is 10^15 digits, so even if you can get the best conversion location in constant order, you won't get it in time.
　They want to take advantage of the fact that they have the same number lined up.
　　A sequence of 1s, for example, can simply be converted to a number of times its length.
　　Row 2 is already difficult.
　　　Because something other than 2 will appear when you convert it.
　　　Is it enough to show that a mid-column conversion is not optimal?
　　　I would like to observe the optimal solution by force for a short sequence of 2
　Official Explanation
　　Can be shown to be independent of the order of operations
　　Oh, I misunderstood the problem condition, it was a sum, not a product.
　　It can be shown that the number of times is constant regardless of the choice of operation.
