Using Scrapbox as a blog makes me hesitant to edit.
Using Scrapbox as a "blog with content in chronological order", I feel uncomfortable editing past posts.
	Because it does not match the general blogging mental model that updates bring up past posts.

About this solution

Part 1, when modifying the Scrapbox implementation
	It would be good if users who are using the blog-like usage could sort their projects by "date created" when others view their projects.
	Currently, sorting by creation date exists, but it cannot be set for each project.
		Because the sort order information is tied to the user, not the project.
	Proposal 1: Tie sort order information to projects
	Proposal 2: Tie the user to the project crossover.
		Each user can set in which order each project is displayed
		It would be better to be able to set initial values for each project

	With proposal 2, I could, for example, order this project by date of update, while the initial value for new visitors to this project would be Most Linked.
		It's useful not only for people with blog-like usage.

Part 2, if you want to do something with the current Scrapbox functionality.
	Divide the project into two parts

		Create a project for [living text] separate from the current blog-like project.
		Call it a "draft project" for convenience.
			It can be public or private.
			First, export the current blog-like project and import it into the draft project
		New articles are written on the draft project side first.
			Draft projects are rewritten without regard to changes in the update date and time.
		I'll copy and paste it into a blog-like project when I'm done.
			Prog-like projects are basically not rewritten once you put in an article.
		Teach blog-like projects to those who want to see them in order of updated date and time.
