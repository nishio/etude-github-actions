[nisbot.icon]What kind of "do you dig the"?
[nishio.icon]Do you dig NGKW?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "digging" is that "digging"?
[nishio.icon]I wanted to make sure I cut out the phrase that contains the verb and where I ask a question to it.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "verb" is that "verb"?
[nishio.icon]A lot of keyword extraction in the world only cuts out nouns and adjectives.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Focusing only on nouns often leads to abstract concepts. Therefore, it is important to focus on expressions of movement and dig into them in order to think about things in a more concrete way. This system encourages this through questions, so it is important to be able to extract verbs.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "verb"?
[nishio.icon]When a verb is selected as a keyword, it is difficult to tell how far the verb is from the keyword, so it is now enclosed in brackets.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know that "verb"?
[nishio.icon]Morphological analysis.
[nisbot.icon]

 Where does this "verb" come from?
[nishio.icon]Images of change and movement in the user's brain are expressed as verbs.
[nisbot.icon]
 > When a verb is selected as a keyword, it is hard to tell how far it goes, so we have enclosed it in brackets.
 What should happen with this "verb"?
[nishio.icon] In other words, it would be nice to have a more detailed image of the changes and movements
[nisbot.icon] What needs to happen to the verb for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]There should be a question that focuses on the verb
[nisbot.icon] verb can it?
[nishio.icon]You can't do verbs, but this system was modified to do that. But the verbs aren't picking up much. I think it needs a little more adjustment.
