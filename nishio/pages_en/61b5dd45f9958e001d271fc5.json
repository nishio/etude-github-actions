from ["Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Session 1].
To invent a [metaphor] to express a prior felt meaning is "[comprehension]."
　It already has a felt meaning and we want to symbolize it.
　　But none of the existing symbols fit perfectly with what I want to say.
　　So combine existing symbols.
　　[nishio.icon] "Isn't that the same explanation you gave at the metaphor?" You thought? Correct!

　　[nishio.icon]So, for example, "understanding" in "reading a book and understanding what it says" or "seeing a metaphor and understanding what it means" is different from COMPREHENSION. Caution.
