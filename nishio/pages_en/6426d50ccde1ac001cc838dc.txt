I want to search other people's Scrapboxes for vectors.
I want to do a vector search of Scrapboxes of people who don't publish a vector index.
　Not just Scrapbox, but blogs and the like, right?
　In the first place, not only digital books, but also paper books, right?
　We need a box that allows us to plug in anything we are interested in and make it vector searchable.

from [mapping Scrapbox rows to Kozane in Kozaneba].
　I'd love to vector search Scrapbox for people who haven't created a vector index.
　　shokai or rashitamemo.
　　I think it could be made on the same principle as well backups are made on Github...
　　I mean, I wish my project was updated once a day.
　　And while we're at it, here's a summary of the updated section...
		→[Vector search across multiple projects].
　[ported to Python with GPT-4].
　　It's done.
　　I guess we can now take data from anyone's project...
　　So what did I want to do with it (far away)?
　　I'm tired today, so let's call it a day.
　You can use this script to both automatically update your own project daily and take someone else's project, but they're two different things to begin with.
　　I don't need every day except for my own projects.
　It's convenient to be able to search vectors and ask questions, but it's inconvenient to have to sit in front of a computer.
　　The problem is that the index file is too big when trying to deploy it to use from a phone.
　　Hmmm, I guess that would be [Pinecore]...
　LLMs can submit search queries.
　　Experiments have actually been done to receive it and search Wikipedia.
　　Then, when you read Scrapbox and see the link notation, you can make the query "Read that link".
　　A system that utilizes the link structure of Scrapbox
