discard the conjugative suffix (i.e. "-", "-", "-", "-")
I saw it on [/takker], and at first I thought, "Is he trimming the end of a title that's too long?" But then I realized that it looks like they are cutting off the conjugation endings.

For example, if "what can be done" is linked with "what can be done", "what can't be done" can also be linked with "what can be done".
It's like a hack for using a "wiki that only links with exact string matches" in a language with conjugation.
