 *1219066188*Diary of today's household chores
 I bought about $100 worth of pumpkins at half price.
 I bought cucumbers.
 
 This morning I had to eat fried rice for lunch because my breakfast Soukai Vitamin was depleted, and I drank Soukai Vitamin for lunch. I went to a convenience store and bought two onigiri (rice balls) to have with about 350 kcal, but when I thought about it calmly, I realized that I should buy a salad or something like that because I wanted to feel full without eating too many calories. I should buy a salad or something because I want to feel full.
 
 Also, I was going to get a haircut on the way home, but I forgot all about it. Oops.
 
 I found out after buying onigiri at a convenience store that 350 kcal per meal is not that difficult to achieve. I found out after buying onigiri (160 kcal) and SOYJOY (140 kcal) that it is not so difficult to eat 350 kcal per meal, as long as I avoid some dangerous food items. I used to eat Sukiya's special eel bowl about twice a week, but that seems to be high in calories, too. A bag of brown sugar karinto (a kind of sweetened sugar with sugar content of 105 yen) has 800 kcal, which is too dangerous. I hid it away because I might unintentionally eat it if I put it where I can see it. It is for emergency evacuation when my blood sugar level drops. I need to eat enough carbohydrates so that I don't feel hunger because I don't want my muscles to be broken down.
 
 *1219067899* Time flies by so fast.
 I read higepon's article "You should set a timetable for studying" and today I'm going to start studying at 11am. It all happened so fast. Even though I haven't done much.
