 	The UI for adding stickies, the current toolbar that you can put on top of the toolbar, is also very subtle because you can't Undo it.
	 I drag stickies instantly.
 		I'll afford what I can.
	 I think adding stickies should be a modal dialog.
  →Really?
  	Unnecessarily add more modes
 Currently, the preview of the sticky is live updated every time you write in the text area when adding a new one.
	 Live updates of previews may not be necessary.
 	I think a prompt would be fine.

I deleted the code related to the sticky addition panel and now I have 8 additions and 162 deletions.
	Note that this may be necessary when adding "[edit existing stickies]" function in the future.

It's relatively good on a cell phone.
