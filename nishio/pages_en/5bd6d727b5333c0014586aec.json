I want to prevent the brightness from changing depending on the panel orientation.

 [The slide orientation changes under "Always face this way," but the result is either too bright to read or too dark.

 I heard that [Shader] should be set to [Unlit/Texture].
	code:cs
  obj.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.shader = Shader.Find("Unlit/Texture");

 This alone [would be magenta].
  If you specify a Unlit/Texture shader dynamically from a script, it will be assumed to be a shader that is not in use at compile time and will be deleted. To avoid this, put the material that uses the shader under Resources.

 I want to make sure that the brightness does not change depending on the orientation of the slide.
