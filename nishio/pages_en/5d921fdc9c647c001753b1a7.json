20190930 Rule Amendment
[Spaghetti Code" rule]

	It's not good that flag shaving is the right path in many cases when there is an obvious winning path called life, it should at least be balanced.
		There are many pathways to remove cards and flags, and many ways to reduce flags with the flag sacrifice command, but only two damage sources, and one of them is the flag sacrifice command.
	The rule is that you choose whether or not to activate it, but there are no disadvantages to most commands, and it's better to activate it.
		→Added cards of the system that pay the cost and show strong power.
	MoveCommand is too strong.
		You can move any card to any location, and the flag remains so you can continue to use it.
		With two Reverse and two cards, you can have an infinite combo.
		→ Weakened and changed to SwapCard
	Even though the order is different, the combos tend to be similar because the 10 cards are the same each time
		In the form of 10 cards out of 16 cards to be played.
		I recommend that you always include the three BASIC cards, but advanced players may be able to play without them.
	Add a card that pays life to increase flags to weaken the flag shaving victory path
	Promoting a system that swaps the order of flags that was an extra card to a starter.
	Two additional damage-related cards
	Memory on expansion card is promoted to a stalwart.
		The rules were adjusted and named Subroutine.
	Argument that there is a stalemate resolution rule to avoid draws, but it's getting too complicated, so it's better to allow draws, style to allow draws anyway.
	increment-decrement
		It is removed when the cursor leaves the card.
		Multiple parameters on a single card
			- Choose one of these
			+ Works on everything
	provisional rule
		Constraint that increment is not negative, is it necessary? → Remove once
