Need assistance with [bracketing], not [automatic bracketing
	The process of choosing keywords has a positive effect, so it's not good for machines to take it away from humans.
	But the "good way" is so unknown that it's hard for people to learn.
 It takes time to get to the point where it's worth it.

Specific UI proposal
[https://gyazo.com/87b00bf53efc7eedfc6937701648ff85]
	A link is suggested in the form of a list of checkboxes, tap on it and it becomes a link
		Press the Copy button to copy the edited lines, go back to Scrapbox, paste, and you're good to go!
	Links in/out of the text
		Links in the text
			The link in the text is, in essence, "[keyword extraction]"
			An approach to extracting keywords from text
			Based on the list of strings that have already been made into links on Scrapbox, the approach determines if the string is included in the text.
		Links not in the text
			[I would like to associate "information sharing" with "information sharing."]
			If there is a page that is closely related to the word from which it appears, it may be a good idea to link to that page
				People don't often recall similar sentences they have written in the past, so this is an opportunity to bring awareness
			Suggestions that link to strings that are not in the text provide value that search fails to provide.

	It is important to let humans choose, not to automatically bracket them.

Lack of knowledge about the "goodness" of the bracketing
	Data should be collected on how people who are familiar with the system use it.
