Four elements of human enhancement -1: Artifacts (e.g., software) -2: Language -3: Methodology -4: Training )

[https://gyazo.com/6683553298b71098e58cfac3294651dc]
Software is not the only way to enhance - creating software (artifacts) is not the only way to enhance - creating words to help people think - verbalizing and systematizing "how to do things" - and educating people on how to use them. And educate people on how to use them.

19 Q: What is the first step in the "learning" process?

[https://gyazo.com/35cdbde3f30c4e0a0ddad5547088ad7a]
20In order to learn something new, you need to be aware of your *blind spots* *things you don't know and didn't realize you "didn't know"

[https://gyazo.com/fbaff99ba9403b749a45f066acee516d]
Observe reality without preconceptions and look for discrepancies with your understanding21

[https://gyazo.com/f9baf4c3ab8e7683253100c23bf0535a]
Specific examples for engineers22Read error messages properlyDon't assume "this must be the case" but write confirmation codeRead the acceleration manual after profiling what is slow (even if in English)Pay attention to the discrepancy between your understanding (=assumptions) and reality

[https://gyazo.com/25f4ad16d2a3122f1b82649af509e633]
Difficult to see without preconceived notions23 ← You don't see it

[https://gyazo.com/fc2212e040431bf3c24838801c67d3e3]
24 Reducing preconceptions by gaining more perspectives "other people's" perspectives are useful.

[https://gyazo.com/4354fb3e56e6413ca9e3524a710799bd]
Is this right? People with more knowledge teach people with less knowledge, people with less knowledge teach people with more knowledge, and people with less knowledge teach people with more knowledge.

[https://gyazo.com/2692fd69fd86022a3056c7d0f12b4e92]
A B, which can be learned from those with little knowledge.

[https://gyazo.com/4fd9d86a0ab955b69c7f74e9a19a731a]
×x A mental barrier created by the belief that there is nothing that can be taught to you, which you learn one way from someone other than yourself.

[https://gyazo.com/ccef7f621bcd5083e64cdf90ea4f5b35]
○○ Exchange knowledge with each other and learn from each other

[https://gyazo.com/ac4c78deefa2c9faeeacff6440abad8b]
29 Reducing preconceptions by gaining more perspectives "other people's" perspectives are useful

[https://gyazo.com/078239061dcbb6a8bd920cb4acdc06f0]
Observe reality without preconceptions and look for discrepancies with your understanding30

[https://gyazo.com/fb6d7261da1260cb99e036cbfd6cd2ec]
31That's what it takes to find and learn about blind spots.

[https://gyazo.com/119b72f8bd653e38029b38c5d6c783b9]
Bad Pattern 32: The structural problem is not a problem of individuals who "only listen" and "only say", but a structural problem of "[fixed roles of "teachable" and "teachable"]". How can this be resolved?

[https://gyazo.com/203903743ea696e5c06ea84fa6444424]
First of all, think about "people who only listen "33 "Let's be on the speaking side at study groups, etc." I've got an ear for it, and few people do it, but I don't know what I can teach myself → I can't take the first step.

[https://gyazo.com/dfdfdd6c58246efbe78885cd5daa8f5b]
34What you will learn

[https://gyazo.com/abde13a5f29dc747f1ea436c4ad5a6bb]
35The more abstract the knowledge, the more applicable it is.

[https://gyazo.com/36e291349d49ddc4447cff5902fd40cf]
36Memorize the answer to a concrete problem → learn how to solve it (abstract methodology) as many times as you can solve that problem → solve new problems.

[https://gyazo.com/cb5bc9d48fdb62ecd224aac054bec102]
37Can one learn abstract methodology without solving concrete problems?

[https://gyazo.com/76905e35a31adf3d67f63c7ad552450b]
38 that repeatedly abstracts from one's own experience and fosters understanding.

[https://gyazo.com/f401b394d36258a85650eeec4bc32a82]
Knowledge that cannot be applied unless it is connected to the "root" of experience39 Rootless Knowledge Rooted Knowledge Applied

[https://gyazo.com/25c227f81b2579a03cdc75afcc7a211e]
40 Experience

[https://gyazo.com/24dfe83a656b60a828724f2245a28c3f]
41[I am the most knowledgeable person in the world about "what I have experienced"].

[https://gyazo.com/13184b676ceee76c4ee16ec01ae11a70]
Common examples42 Presenter "afraid of failure, afraid of making mistakes"→Representation by copying the textbook→When asked a question, he/she can only answer "that's what the textbook says"→Questioning is not lively, and trying to avoid failure leads to a bigger failure.

[https://gyazo.com/20564a5ac2948a32a7379560c84e839e]
Don't try to avoid making mistakes43 - If you think of yourself as a "teacher," you may think that making mistakes is a failure - but since the goal is to "teach each other," the process of being corrected and discussed is beneficial in itself. The process of discussion is not useful if you use an "outside authority" such as a textbook as justification for your presentation.

[https://gyazo.com/f462fe41cff48ef6628cc66ca0f2e6be]
Experience is the main dish44I had this experience (fact) (option) Textbook says this (fact) I understood this (interpretation) →This leaves room for the listener to give his/her own interpretation

[https://gyazo.com/3b5f3c177a6bffc23dcaa66adfb25711]
45 on the verification of understanding.

[https://gyazo.com/6f011bc332e8b393f75774fe649321b8]
How do I know if the "understanding" I have developed within myself is knowledge I can apply? 46

[https://gyazo.com/a16926d4533c1494b569ea17b9d292df]
47 "Understood" is only a hypothesis.

[https://gyazo.com/107bbb8ec39bca95c281cbb98cc882cf]
Let's test the hypothesis by experimenting48Verification: Did it turn out the way you thought it would?

[https://gyazo.com/860858058612c806d2c161f8fd7ed358]
Specific examples for engineers49When learning a programming language: A: I read the manual and understand it! The end! B: I read the manual and felt I understood it, so I implemented a program to check it!

57 write it down and then we'll figure it out.

[https://gyazo.com/6bff71e0599246da2b1685f8b7de0850]
58 eliminate the need to write down and remember everything that might be relevant first.

[https://gyazo.com/6c4e8baac8679c96e85922bfa09b2d21]
59 specific example, "Write 50 sticky notes of things that might be good material for your presentation."

[https://gyazo.com/cbe820d3ff21d939f60ddd39c746f722]
60 "Make presentation materials" is a large, unmeasurable task that tends to lose motivation "Write 50 sticky notes with stories" is measurable and can be performed in a gap of time

73 Diagrams are good for organizing the big picture of one's understanding -> but not communicated to others

[https://gyazo.com/31f5aa0b6b65eeba021c510c5d89a8cc]
74 illustration is two dimensional, writing is one dimensional, and speaking to people is one dimensional, and if you want to communicate to people, you need to be one dimensional.

[https://gyazo.com/0cd9d775d481bcc5e661b1689bc2e972]
How to escape from the "listen-only person" - output to others and learn from their feedback. -Write 50 sticky notes in your spare time and assemble them from the bottom up. -Focus on your own experience. I am the most knowledgeable person in the world on the subject.

81 "People who just say" issue

[https://gyazo.com/c77e21d7848510d01421171aef865fef]
The problem of "people who just say" 82The problem of "people who just say" is even more serious than the problem of "people who just listen" in the goal of "exchanging knowledge and learning from each other.

84 preconceived notions and frames of thinking
[Comfort Zone]
How do we break it down?

[https://gyazo.com/18d8e9b40fc06e4e5f6a32afefb98080]
The Flow of Breaking the Frame85 1. Realize that you have a pre-existing frame 2. Suspend rather than judge by your frame 3. Overcome the idea that "changing the frame doesn't make sense" 4. Overcome the fear of "fear of changing the frame"

[https://gyazo.com/1978e1ddd6071145bf1f5b3fe05f6481]
A concrete example for engineers86Engineer N is a self-proclaimed "I feel more comfortable talking to a machine than to a human being. ↓He is asked if he would like to be an interviewer. I have no such experience and no confidence! →I'll do it though (overcoming the fear of changing the frame).

[https://gyazo.com/f3476c9b6ceb757430fb95967290846b]
How to "listen" 87 I never learned how to listen! I bought 10 books on interviewing and made all of them sticky notes and KJ'd them, not so many important concepts.

[https://gyazo.com/d75a2536375e093d9be3b3c9c6407ed3]
88The words used by the other party are not always used in the sense that you think they mean.

89 customer "build [a time machine]" engineer "there's no way you can do that."

[https://gyazo.com/cebf6d6b6678e362d0465fdd5c2619a1]
90 thinking that what the other party is trying to describe by the term "time machine" is the same as their own idea of a time machine.

[https://gyazo.com/1dcb42c7a64e7c19f115ac7c5ef16603]
91 If you think about it dispassionately, it's obvious that the premise isn't true, but you're distorting reality in your own frame of reference.

[https://gyazo.com/07e625c773c6e0a2dcba3c13e4e64791]
92Customer "Build a time machine" Engineer "What kind of time machine?" Engineer: "What would you like the time machine to do?"

[https://gyazo.com/679c679df960249a7861dcae5bdd4830]
93Sensitive to assumptions.

94 Choosing between A and B: "Which do you prefer, product A or product B?" The premise of buying one or the other is implicitly acknowledged.

[https://gyazo.com/8971a4fc3e5a76e5a013d3571fa8518f]
95 Assumptive questions are easy to elicit answers to, but they distort the answers.

[https://gyazo.com/004890b71e422ca540bd8ba14a7c3ad0]
96 "What is your latest concern?" → Assuming that you are troubled

[https://gyazo.com/40a75e4fe7fed7fc60ec6b7cd29d9e68]
97 "What technologies have you been interested in recently?" → Assumption of interest in technology

[https://gyazo.com/060c7ecbf5ceefa32076b720a5adb043]

100I think it is important for "teachers" to get out of their comfort zone and actively take on the role of "teacher" in order to eliminate the stereotypical "teachable" and "teachable" roles.

[https://gyazo.com/1407ed63a832013d34c847539ff826f9]
How to Get Out of "Just Say It" 101 - Get out of the "teaching role" and play the "teaching role". -Premises and words have different meanings for you and the other person. Don't impose your own frame of reference on the other person. -Encourage and motivate the other person to speak.
