自動化の罠
	Chores that need to be done about once a month (invoicing)
 I sometimes feel like I can't [automate].
 I think, "Well, it's the same stuff every month anyway, so why can't we automate it?"
 But when you write down the task to be done, it is a much lighter task than automating it.
 If [the task] remains unclear, it will appear larger than the entity. So you want to automate it.
 When engineers are quick to say "automation," some things really should be automated, but in many cases, it may simply be because the entire task is not clearly defined, so it looks somewhat big, and they want to avoid that by saying "automation.
 It's also rather tedious to properly maintain an automated system that only runs once a month.
