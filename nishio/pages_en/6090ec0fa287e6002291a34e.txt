 *1477372777* If you have 300 yen and buy a 170 yen loaf of bread, the average change is 0.03 yen
 The problem is that it does not say "hold three 100-yen coins". There are 3,506 ways to hold 300 yen in coins circulating in Japan. In all but four of these ways, "three 100 yen coins," "two 100 yen coins and two 50 yen coins," "one 100 yen coin and four 50 yen coins," and "six 50 yen coins," the change will be zero yen because you have enough coins of 10 yen or less. In these four ways, the change will be 30 yen, so the average value of change is 120 / 3506 = 0.034227... is.
