W-type problem-solving model
[https://gyazo.com/390334994715674be46fc76dfc2c7989]
According to [Jiro Kawakita] of [KJ method].

 We need [field science] before [experimental science]."
  Before the phase of "experimental science" in which [trial and error] is repeated, a phase is necessary to first generate the initial "[hypothesis]. Jiro Kawakita called this phase "field science. The field science phase consists of "[exploration]," "[observation]," and "[idea].

	The [Thinking Level] and [Experience Level] correspond to the [Bottom] and [Top] of my [Pyramid Model].
	ã€€[What is the bottom in the pyramid metaphor?]

[I gave a lecture titled "W-type Problem Solving Model of KJ Method and U-Theory, and their respective problem consciousness". - Yasukazu Nishio's Hatena Diary http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20150519/1432006437]
>I recently gave a lecture on what [U Theory] is about at the Software Engineering Technical Committee of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association ([JEITA]).
>In explaining the [U-shaped model] of U Theory, this slide explains from "what other [models] exist in the first place" and "what is similar and what is different" so that you can understand how the [PDCA cycle], [Lean Startup], [KJ method], etc. and U Theory are similar and different from each other from many aspects. I think you will be able to understand how U Theory is similar to and different from [PDCA Cycle], [Lean Startup], [KJ Method], etc.
"[T]he W-type problem-solving model of the KJ method and the U-theory, and their respective problematics."
