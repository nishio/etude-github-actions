The preface, "I may be an old man, but..." adds to the stench of old age.
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1453283609264238600]: I think it's a bit like saying "I may be an old person, but I don't really think I'm an old person", "I want someone to comfort me that I'm not an old person", "I'm not an old person", "I'm not an old person", "I'm not an old person", and so on. You don't realize how lame your desires are leaking out" take over and make you even more of an old person than the original old person statement.

	>[helmetti https://twitter.com/helmetti/status/1453119776780271623]: you may call me an old manager, but I have a ban on using company resources to do Kaggle. There is raw data in front of me that has yet to be answered, so why not dig for it is a mystery to me. Normally you would jump on it and dig around. There is no improvement without curiosity.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1453288370726187017]: The cause of the old man smell is not "whether or not Kaggle was banned", but "you don't seem to be able to listen to the ideas of people with different values in making the decision to ban Kaggle", but you don't seem to be able to recognize that (another old man smell +1). It's "whether you banned Kaggle or not", but you don't seem to be able to recognize it.

[Old man]
