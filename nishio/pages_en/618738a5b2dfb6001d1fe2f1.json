The old man's "I've done it before" is worthless.
People who dabble in this or that usually have "been there, done that" when it comes to things that have been around for a long time.
There's no scarcity of old people who've done it before, because there are plenty of old people who have swept it off their feet.
Even if you've "done a little of this in the past," if you haven't done it recently, the opinion of someone who has "done a little of this recently" is more valuable
