Shortest path dual and differential constraints
Why [differential constraints] appear in [LP dual] of [shortest path] problem?
[https://gyazo.com/6383c2b4450a186f5a729b809b359e18]
	The shortest path problem corresponds to the special case of the [minimum cost flow] problem, where there is enough capacity on the edges to flow 1
	A distinction must be made between having no edges and having edges and zero cost.
	　Creating variables to express the presence or absence of edges gets complicated.
	　and assume that the edge sets are prearranged in a row and mapped to the natural numbers.
　Consider a [$ |E| \times |V| ] matrix A that expresses which vertices each edge connects
　　Row i is for edge [$ i = (u, v)] with column u = -1, column v = 1
　Consider a [$ |V|]-dimensional vector b representing a starting point and an end point
　Starting point s is -1, ending point t is 1
	Let f: flow, c: cost be a [$ |E|] dimensional vector
	This way it can be written simply as a [linear programming problem
  minimize: [$ f^T c]
  subject to:
  	[$ A^Tf = b] 
  	[$ f \ge 0] 
	The [dual linear programming problem] can be written using the [$ |V|]-dimensional vector p (potential) as
  maximize: [$ p^T b]
  subject to:
  	[$ Ap \le c] 
	Row i of A is in the form of a difference if we recall that u column = -1, v column = 1 for edge [$ i = (u, v)], b is -1 for starting point s and 1 for ending point t
  maximize: [$ p_t - p_s]
  subject to:
  	[$ p_v - p_u \le c_e \quad (\mathrm{for\,all\,} e = (u, v))]

　[LPs, Graphs and Formulations]
	Both are formulated using the set of edges [$ \delta^+(v), \delta^-(v)] entering and leaving a point, but how that corresponds to the general form of the linear programming problem expressed in terms of matrix multiplication and how it is dual was not obvious to me so I bit the bullet.
