Spoilers and episodic memory
>[https://twitter.com/raurublock/status/671172622785183744?s=21&t=fmWnIlglRq28hkorJmvOtg @raurublock]: Human memory capacity has [episodic memory] and [semantic memory], but Episodic memory is the memory of the episodes, and semantic memory is the memory of the meaning of the episodes. Episodic memory-centered people consider "what kind of feelings I had when I saw it for the first time" to be important, so they strongly dislike spoilers that spoil those feelings.
> On the other hand, those who are semantic memory-centered do not feel much emotion on first viewing, but find enjoyment in gradually composing and strengthening the [semantic network] in their brain through repeated viewing and thinking, and emotion arises as the semantic network grows. Spoilers are easily tolerated as part of this process.
> It is difficult for people who rely strongly on episodic memory and people who rely strongly on semantic memory to discuss their impressions. People with strong episodic memory have strong feelings at the moment they see an image and want to talk about them on the spot. However, people with strong semantic memory have not yet developed a semantic network at that stage, and do not have many feelings or impressions.

[find enjoyment in the growth of the semantic network].
ã€€Very Scrapbox-like.

The reason I go to museums, theaters, and movie theaters alone is because I can't meet up with others at the same time. It is best to meet at the entrance of the art exhibition and meet at the exit, and [* I am still watching a play I saw 10 years ago and keep writing about it. The logic of "getting in the way of line processing" doesn't hold water.
