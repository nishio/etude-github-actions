Speed of knowledge obsolescence
 There is knowledge that is less likely to [become] obsolete and knowledge that is more likely to become obsolete.

 The kind of knowledge that is hardly obsolete even five years later.
  How did you learn that?"
  If you put in as much time as I do, in five years you'll know as much as I do."

 If it's hard to become obsolete, if it's obvious, if it's easy to learn, if the demand is clear, people will learn.
  So it's either not obvious that it's not easily obsolete, or it's not easy to learn, or the demand isn't clear.
