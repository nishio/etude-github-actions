Need deadlines to reach goals
	seemingly paradoxical
 I think we can do better without [time constraints] than with them.
	This "[good thing] could be made" is wicked.
 In trying to make something good, we set our goals very far away #faraway goals
	Need to get closer to the goal to [reach], but [pride] and other factors get in the way.
 So it is better to have [a deadline] as an external constraint
 Instead of [trying to make something good from the start], make something terrible first and then [improve].

[Without a deadline, you run toward a very distant goal that you will never reach.]
