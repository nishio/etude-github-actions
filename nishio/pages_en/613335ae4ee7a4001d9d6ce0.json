Verify behavior of hoppers side by side

	I built a device to check the behavior of the hopper, but unlike the signal, it's slow, so I didn't need to build it this long...

I realized that the hopper turns off when the on signal comes on, so to move it around a bit and see how it behaves, I need a "circuit that is always on and makes off pulses of a specified length".
	Logic negation of [adjustable-length pulse generator] output with torch

Observe what happens when you change the width of the pulse.

Hopper sucking occurs at 2 ticks but no feeding occurs.
	The feed does not occur until the 4th tick, and only occurs at the 5th tick.
	At this time, suction also occurs.
	　(This smells fishy, and it throws off the premise of the design.)
	Furthermore, the transmission to the next hopper is the ninth tick.

From this behavior, if there is enough stuff on the hopper, there is no transition to the "fed but not sucked out" state.
　Controlling this hopper signal alone is not enough to sort.
	It is necessary to create a situation where there is nothing on top of the hopper on the fifth tick.
　　For example, this can be accomplished by droppering only one item every 10 ticks.
