Why include in the denominator the days you didn't do it?
I was writing [a case study on getting closer to the goal] and:.
>The average amount of progress is the progress divided by the "number of days since the start of the project, including days not done.
I felt that I never explained why I included in the denominator the days that I am not working here.

He said, "I calculate the rate of progress using only the days worked as the denominator."
	The day you don't do it will never have happened.
	When you don't have much time and can only do a little, doing a little lowers the average amount of progress.
	When I think, "A high average amount of progress is desirable," I think, "Let's not just do a little bit today, let's do it all at once over the weekend."
	This, of course, is a factor that slows down overall progress
	Do not set KPIs that would cause problems by raising them.

If you use the denominator for the days you are not working on the project.
	If you don't do anything today, progress is 0. If you do a little, it's a plus.
	Since it has nothing to do with the actual number of days of operation, it is possible to estimate "at this pace, what month and day it will end".
