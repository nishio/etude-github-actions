77I now think that the only way to develop understanding is through repeated abstraction from one's own experience, or at least Plato said something similar, that essential knowledge must be produced by each individual. Even if it is given to us, it will not be usable. Philosophy can only help you produce it. Plato compared philosophy to [the art of] midwifery.
