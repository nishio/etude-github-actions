 	　An Early Access version was recently released.
 	　Only works on Windows.
 	　It's pretty buggy, the server crashes, and the screen display is strange.
 	　Free now with Early Access, will there be a fee in the future?
 	　Buy extensions individually, about 10,000 if you buy them all.

When playing with a random mix of expansions, I wanted to know which card came from which expansion, so I made a correspondence chart with the marks.
