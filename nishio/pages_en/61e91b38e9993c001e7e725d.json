(2.3.1) Task is too big
There are people who have only one task but cannot motivate themselvs.
I asked them whether the task is to finish within 4 hours. 58% of them answered "no." The task is too large, in other words, the goal is too far. We need to [make the goal closer] to keep the motivation.

Moreover, 75% of those who answer "no" do not understand how long the task takes. (*17)

They feel as if the task is big because they did not estimate the size of the task. The feeling decreases motivation.

 [(2.3.1.1) Large task of writing a book]
