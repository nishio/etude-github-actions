Unsubstantiated Confidence.
	Some people use the term "unfounded [confidence]" in a positive sense and others use it in a negative sense.
	Negative people see the "lack of evidence" as a problem.
	But what is that "[basis]"?
	How do situations arise that allow us to have confidence based on evidence?
	[Success stories] are a basis for confidence.
		But just because it worked last time doesn't mean it will work this time.
		Not enough to be able to logically base it on.
	Confidence in repeated successes.
	Inherently unable to have "well-founded confidence" in a subject that is not repeated
	You can't have "grounded confidence" when trying something new.
	In this situation, the latter is preferable to those who cannot act because of lack of confidence and those who do
	If this is the case, then "unfounded confidence" would be beneficial.
	This is the way people think about positivity
