My head shifts weirdly in flexbox.

I was consulted about this phenomenon and was troubled for a while, but now that I've solved the mystery, I'd like to summarize.

　Conclusion.
　　Parent div does not have display: flex
　　The child div has display: inline-flex.
　　Baseline alignment is happening because the div is now an inline element.
　consideration
　　For left-to-right alignment purposes, the parent div only needs to have display: flex, so the child divs don't need it.
　　　But in reality, the code is the result of combining parts that have been formatted in flex and were originally attached to the code.
　　If the parent div does not have display: flex, the div is a block element by default, so it is aligned vertically.
　　If the child div is set to display: inline-flex, it will become an inline element, so it will line up left and right.
　　　If there is no content in the div, the layout will appear to be correct at first glance.
