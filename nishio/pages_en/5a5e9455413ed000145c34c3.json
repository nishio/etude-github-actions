chasm theory
To be precise, it is [Innovator Theory], but [Chasm] is probably better known in the world.

 innovator theory
  [Everett M. Rogers] proposed
  1962
  Classification of attitudes toward product purchase into five categories in order of earliest to latest purchase timing
   [Innovator]
   [Early adopters]
   [Early Majority]
   [Late Majority]
   [Lagarde]
 By the way, people who use the "for some reason the classification was determined and the percentage of those people was checked and it was a percentage" way of explaining things like "there are 16% laggards" are the ones who don't understand it properly.
 　Correct, "defined the bottom 16% as laggards."
 　Some people assume that 16%, a "number that doesn't look close enough" has some deeper meaning, but it is simply a normal distribution cut by an integer multiple of a standard deviation that is close enough.

 		Adoption of new technology follows an S-curve, so the frequency of adoption is a bell-shaped curve, so approximate this with a normal distribution

			The normal distribution was sliced into five parts at integer multiples of the standard deviation and named

	Later in the book "[Chasm]", it is claimed that "the gulf (chasm) between early adopters and early majority is deep".
