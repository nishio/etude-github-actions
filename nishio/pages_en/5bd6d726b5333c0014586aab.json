Multiple Instance Creation with Prefab
When [instance] is created from a Prefab, if the parent Prefab is edited, the instance will follow the change (except when [override] is used).

 >The Select button allows you to select the prefab asset from which the instance was generated. This allows you to edit the main prefab and apply the changes to all instances.
 >TheApply button can also be used to save the changed values on the instance side, overwriting the original prefab (except for position and rotation changes). This is effective when you want to apply changes made to any one instance to the entire instance (except for overwriting changed values). It also allows you to make overall changes quickly and easily.
 >TheRevert button can be used to restore an instance to its original prefabricated value if you have tried to override a property and changed it, but would have preferred the default value.
