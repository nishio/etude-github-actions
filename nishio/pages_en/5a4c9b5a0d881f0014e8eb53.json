Parallel Careers and Information Leakage
While the idea that "[parallel careers] are useful for acquiring information from outside the company that is not available within the company" is becoming more and more popular, the idea of a "parallel career" is also becoming more and more popular.
Many are concerned about the "risk of [information leaks]."

What people imagine by the term "parallel career (side job, double job, dual job)" is very different from person to person.
Instead of thinking vaguely about the "risk of information leakage in parallel careers," we should break it down into specific patterns.

Consider the case where Mr. X, who belongs to Company A, conducts a joint business with Company B.
In this case, consider the case of one person, Mr. X, and the case of two persons, Mr. Z, on Person A's side.

 In the two cases, Mr. Z's presence contributes to reducing the risk of information leakage from Mr. X.
  Make sure that the composition of your usual communication with Company B is always communicated to Z.
   For example, inter-company groupware, mailing lists, multi-person chats, always CC your email, etc.
  In this situation, if Mr. X passes information to Company B that is unfavorable to Company A, it will be known to Z immediately.
   First, here's a deterrent.
  X could remove Z's CC and email directly to Y
   In this case, Y can perceive that "X is behaving differently than usual".
   If Y becomes suspicious of the conduct
    I can say to Z, "I got this email from X. Do you know about it?" Z can ask, "Did you know that X sent me this email?
    We could consider X's unusual behavior as a mistake and share, "I was out of CC to Mr. Z."
   In other words, there must be a clear prior sharing of intent between X and Y with respect to leaking information.
    And Y can betray you at any time.
			These increase the risk that X bears.
