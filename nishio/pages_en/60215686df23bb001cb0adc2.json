[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
Test of [nishio.icon] new functionality
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "motion test" is that "motion test"?
[nishio.icon]The ability to resume the previous conversation has been added. This conversation itself is resumed after creating a new browser tab.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "tab" is that "tab"?
It's a [nishio.icon]browser tab, which in essence means an environment that doesn't carry over memories. Until now, nothing really carried over, so if you closed a tab by mistake, you could never reopen it again, but now it carries over the ID of the previous conversation!
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "tab"?
[nishio.icon]Sometimes when I left a conversation unfinished, Safari on my iPhone would reload, and when I got home to check the log, it would be gone.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "conversation" is that "conversation"?
[nishio.icon]What we are exchanging here. I've also improved the UI a bit to show "thinking", which is also rather nice.

 How do you know this "tab"?
[nishio.icon]Aside from that, might the focus be lost when sending a message?

 Where is this "tab" located?
[nishio.icon]It's off...I don't know why this is.
