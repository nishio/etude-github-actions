AI Learning Refused
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1564418355825876997?s=20&t=FjONfgaGIHTfaL-djUsxUA @nishio]: I had a sense of déjà vu when someone started saying "no AI learning"... I was thinking, "no unauthorized links".

In the first place, such a statement may be invalid in violation of Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act, and even if it does not violate Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act, a unilateral statement cannot be concluded as a contract. such a representation is meaningless, at least from a legal standpoint.

 > I feel that it is a borderline where I can't participate in the discussion with my miscellaneous knowledge, because this time "circumvention of technical protection measures is illegal" or "you can override if you sign a contract" which I thought before reading the original article is denied by the experts.

　　I thought, "If I sign a contract, of course I can get an override," but I was surprised to find out that I might not be able to do that either.

In the discussion of fine tuning, I saw the claim that fine tuning is not information analysis because it does not use numerous works.
After checking, we found that "information analysis" is defined in the second paragraph of Article 30-4 as "extracting, comparing, classifying, or otherwise analyzing information pertaining to language, sound, images, and other elements that constitute said information from a large number of works or other large amounts of information. So, the argument is that fine tuning with a few images of a single author is not "information analysis" because it does not satisfy the "many" requirement. I certainly agree~.
