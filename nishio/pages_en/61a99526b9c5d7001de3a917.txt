The future already exists in speck.
>I am from the future! [Hiromi Okuda's lecture begins with these words. Of course, I did not come in a time machine from the year 2050 or something. The future exists "speckled" in the real world, and some [visionary leaders] can already see "the future they want to be. Not only can they see it, they are already living it.

>The future already exists "[muddled]" in the real world... I can already see "the future that I want to be" for me, and I am practicing some of the ways of working in that future through childcare and caregiving. I always say "I am from the future" in the sense that this will become common sense in a few years.
> However... people talk about "common sense" such as "only blessed people are able to act selfishly" and "reality is...". But the reality beyond that reality is spreading more and more, and the reality is being destroyed more and more. In that destroyed place, there are "speckled" people of the future living. I am one of such "speckled" [future people].
