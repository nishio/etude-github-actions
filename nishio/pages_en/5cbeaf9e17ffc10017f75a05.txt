The Nobel Prize-winning research is simply the story of the isolated brain, which is (often knowingly) misrepresented as "proposed by a Nobel Prize-winning scientist."
>One of the achievements that earned him the Nobel Prize was his work on the isolated brain. Patients whose corpus callosum, which transmits signals between the hemispheres, was severed for the purpose of treating epilepsy were asked to perform tasks known to be dependent on one of the cerebral hemispheres, demonstrating that the two hemispheres have independent consciousness. This study contributed significantly to our understanding of the functional differentiation of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. However, the facts revealed by Sperry were distorted or expanded and disseminated to the public.

It is true at least that "people have many different ways of thinking" and that "similar types are more likely to reach consensus."
There is no particular basis for classifying people with various ideas into four types as Herman thinks.
