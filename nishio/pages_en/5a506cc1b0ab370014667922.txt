(the) market (as a concept)
The term "market" is fluffy in its definition.

 Some people in academia claim that the value of research is not determined by the marketplace.
  On the other hand, it is good to write a paper and have it cited by others
  That seems to me to be the state of the market for the product of "papers" in order to get the value of a "citation".
