Teamwork Management
	Relatively easy to manage members with employment contracts in one organization
 	Because the contract stipulates that a certain amount of time is to be given to the organization's objectives.
  Easier if all members have salaries from the organization as their primary income.
   Because all members have an incentive to maintain the organization.
 Managing volunteers is relatively difficult.
 	The amount of time out is not defined.
   Strongly influenced by motivation, thus increasing the importance of managing motivation.
  Members tend to have diverse orientations.
   I'm just temporarily dating for what I want to do, and if it's boring, I'll simply leave the member.
   Members whose organizations need to be sustained in order to achieve the objectives they want to achieve.
   Members for whom the maintenance of the organization itself has become an objective.
   Members who would rather see their organization disbanded than go in a direction that does not suit them.
 Group Work Management
 	Group work in college classes and other settings is common.
  This is a difficult system analogous to volunteering.
   People who want to invest a lot of time and achieve good results.
   People who want credits in as little time as possible.
   People who just wanted knowledge and didn't need credit.
