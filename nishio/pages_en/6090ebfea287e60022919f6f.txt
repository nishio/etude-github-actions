 Unfortunately, I was unaware of this navigation system and walked from one end of the platform to the other, walked up the stairs, and said, "Hey, there's only a ticket gate.
 
 *1239429564*[GAE] I made a template creation script for myself.
 It is a waste to use only 10 application slots of Google App Engine to create a small web app. /manage.py startapp foo, you can run several applications in one application framework, and it's easy to make independent apps. But the default . /manage.py startapp doesn't create the URL dispatch file used by app-engine-patch. So I wrote a script to automate the tedious work. Well, I made it for my own convenience, so it's very personalized. /startapp.py and put in the project name and title, then create urls.py, urlsauto.py and templates/index.html, add a view in views.py that just displays index.html, and write the app in settings.py. Add

 Maybe I should leave all the white circles as black circles to make the second one from the bottom natural... Well, whether the circles are black or white is not essential.

 Oh, the long horizontal line is not about division or symmetry between the top and bottom, it's just that the top three are the more important and famous ones, and since I drew them, I also drew the accessory ones and drew a line in between.

 I also made a black version. I still think this one is better.
 - What is the black square in the center?
 - What is the white square in the center?
 - > something like that.
 - Something like +.
 And the question becomes simple. In the first picture, you have to say "a square with things inside".
