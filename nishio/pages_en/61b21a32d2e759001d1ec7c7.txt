	What is Technology? Three Lectures
		>Three lectures on "[technology]" given by the greatest philosopher of the 20th century [Martin Heidegger] after World War II. Starting from familiar objects such as bottles, bridges, and houses, he considers how these objects are, and finally reaches the "world" in his lectures ["Objects"] and "[Building, Living, Thinking]," and "[[What is Technology]]" which questions the ever-expanding system of modern technology while using things and people as resources. What is technology? A definitive new translation by a leading researcher!
ã€€I bought it on Kindle.

I didn't realize at first that "What is technology?" was "The Question Concerning Technology".
The "thing" could be what Eugene Gendlin was referring to in [Phenomenology as an Illogical Stage].
