Todo, In Progress, and Done by default

The green progress bar is the ratio of To Do to Done, so I put "Things I don't do now (but may do in the future)" and "Things I decided not to do (in the future)" in separate columns.
	There is also an option called [Archive https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/archiving-cards-on-a-project-board], which disappears from the screen
