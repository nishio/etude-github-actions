Changes in Scrapbox usage
I saw what I wrote in May 2017 and corrected it myself in August 2018.

Written in May 2017

That's what I thought when I saw it in August 2018.
	I put a very long sentence in the title [to make the best use of the margins when creating a text-only page in Scrapbox] or something like that.
 But I don't think this is a very good stance to take.
	The title is a summary and an eye catcher, so it is better to write a shorter, more concise description of the part that moved you the most.
 Make it a title that your future self will think, "Sounds interesting, let's read it.
  I don't mean to exaggerate the content and make it a fishing title.
 With a title like the tasteless `20180101 memo', it's hard to get motivated to read it again.
 	I only read it when I get a hit from a search.
  If you can't think of a good title, it is better to write first even with such a title, good titles will come to you later

 I clicked on the ref to see what was at the end of the ref and it was Amazon.
  And the URL is shortened to t.co, so you can't tell what it is until you follow it, which is not good!
  Recently, I've been doing `[Amazon URL]` and stating that the link is to Amazon.
	To begin with, I just checked and there are multiple pages in the project that link to "Serendipity of Random Reading".
  It should have been a link within Scrapbox, not an external link.
  Then those pages would have connected on their own.
	Let's put the link to Amazon on the "Serendipity of Random Reading" page.

 It's important to post images.
 Keywords in the title should be chopped and linked.
 I made a link to `Shihiko Toyama` in the author's name and it connected to other pages.
  I was able to discover that a page exists that mentions another book by the same author, "Organizing Thoughts."

 Older ones had the link separately at the end, but the ones that appear in the text will be made into a link in the text.
 The link outside the text was changed to `#quick read

 Loose keywords such as "memory" and "understanding" were also made into links.
 	It's hard for humans to notice when something that should be linked wasn't.
  It's easy for humans to ignore when something superfluous is linked to it.
  Seemingly superfluous items may actually be useful, leading to the discovery of unexpected connections

	It is a simple page with two lines of text and one tag, but it seems to have become very interesting.
