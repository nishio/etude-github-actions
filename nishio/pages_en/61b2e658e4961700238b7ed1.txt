dwell-think
>Thinking itself belongs to dwelling in the same sense as building, but in a different way. This may be testified to in the path of contemplation we have attempted this time.
> Building and thinking, in their own ways, are inevitable for living. On the other hand, both are inadequate for living as long as they are separate and apart, doing their own thing without listening to each other. They can only listen to each other when they recognize that building and thinking belong to dwelling, but remain within their own boundaries, and that each comes from a workplace of long experience and constant discipline.
