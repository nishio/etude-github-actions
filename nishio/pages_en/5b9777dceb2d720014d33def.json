self-organizing model
Hori's Self-Organization Model [Theory and Application of Creative Activity Support] p.59
[$ \dot{q}_\lambda = -k_\lambda q_\lambda + \sum_\mu g_{\mu\lambda} \alpha_\mu + F_\lambda ]
[$ \dot{\alpha}_\mu = -\gamma \alpha_\mu + \sum_\lambda h_{\lambda\mu} q_\lambda + \Gamma_\mu ]
[$ \mu] と [$ \lambda]
[$ \alpha_\mu] と [$ q_\lambda]
	[$ q_\lambda] is an order parameter at the upper level that governs the behavior of the entire system
 [$ \alpha_\mu] is the activity of the element at the lower level
[$ k]と[$ \gamma]
	[$ k] is the knowledge level attenuation coefficient
	[$ \gamma] is the symbol-level attenuation factor

The second term is in essence an inner product, and if q and α are taken as vectors, g and h are matrix multiplication
