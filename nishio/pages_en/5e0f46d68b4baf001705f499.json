Etymology of Happiness
>Hiroaki Iima @IIMA_Hiroaki
>In Aya Shimazu's "Ito", "To be able to meet the thread that one should meet / People call it shisattei (to meet)" is etymologically correct, isn't it? Originally, the word for [chance meeting] was "[shiawase]," and the word for a good meeting was "shiawase ga iii na na," which was contracted to "shiawase desu na," and then the kanji was applied to the word to make it "[happiness]. A well thought-out lyric.

>The etymology of the word [happy] is the same as [happen], and the original meaning is "[coincidental] happiness. I hope you can somehow recognize it by yourself, but this one is more difficult because the meanings are so far apart. Actually, the Japanese word for "happiness" is the same as the Japanese word "tsuriawase," which means "to be fortunate.
