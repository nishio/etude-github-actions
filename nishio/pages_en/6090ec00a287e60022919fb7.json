 (Editor's note: <a href='http://www.klab.jp/tenka1programer/bosyu.html'>Tenkaichi Programmer Contest</a>) Tenkaichi Cowboy Contest is a registered trademark, so if they plan to use a similar trade name, they will have to go to court.

 I would like to observe the trial if it goes to court! I wonder if they will call Akira Toriyama as a witness to explain to the judge what the Tenkaichi Budokai is all about?

 It's quickly becoming <a href='http://java-ja.yoshiori.org/index.php?FrontPage'>tenkaichijava-en</a>! LOL!
 
 *1245646539*End of Art Week
 Well, my week of art-related activities has come to an end. I've been inspired by a lot of things, and I have eight ideas that I haven't implemented yet, including some that I've been writing for a while, and about five data that I haven't sent to the printers yet, but I'm not sure they'll turn out good if I rush to make them, so I'm going to put them to bed.
 
 Let's get back to preparing for programming camps, minimum hash generators for regression analysis, etc. The core is a programmer who occasionally creates artwork, which gives it a unique perspective, and I think if we get too immersed in art, we lose our uniqueness.

 They mention "Street Computing" where people hack on the street or rooftops.
