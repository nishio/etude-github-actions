LoanDEAL Salon
I was invited by Seki-san to attend a social gathering of LoanDEAL transferees for which I am a mentor. The meeting is for those who have completed their transfer period to talk about their experiences in front of those who are in the process of transferring and those who will be transferring in the future. The transferees have both a "personal network" at their new venture and a "personal network" of people who have transferred at the same time.

Aside from the venture experience during the transfer period, they will become a large [channel of information flow into the company] by connecting with the outside world in this way. The network created in this way will create great value five to ten years down the road.

Gray is the company boundary. People who belong to the company form a network across the company by sticking out and belonging to the temporary community enclosed by the red dotted line.
