Parable of the Hot Air Balloon
	Dropping a weighted sand bag from a hot air balloon
 Drop one, drop two, and the hot air balloon begins to float when the Nth one is dropped.
 Is it correct that "it was the dropping of this sandbag that caused the hot air balloon to float?"
 	No doubt it triggered it.
  But to assume that it is the sole cause is ridiculous.
 	Only when combined with the presence of hot air in the balloon and up to N-1 sandbags being dropped, does it "float".
