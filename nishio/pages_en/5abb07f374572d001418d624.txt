Perception of risk
There are two ways to feel [risk]: "I have to do something about it, it's not good" and "I might lose money if I get involved.
The latter is thinking about his own gain or loss, while the former is thinking about whether society is going in the right or wrong direction.

 I agree with your point that there are two ways to perceive risk. I became a board member of the Unexplored Foundation because when the only full-time board member resigned last summer and our human resources were drastically reduced, I thought, "We have to do something, or we're in trouble," and in terms of personal gain or loss, I don't get paid a penny, so I'm in the red for the time I take out.
