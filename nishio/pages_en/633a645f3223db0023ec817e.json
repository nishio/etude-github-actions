able to criticize but not to create (criticise)
>Glance of eye high and hand low.
> To have a discerning eye but little actual skill or ability. They have knowledge and criticize this and that, but they do not have the ability to actually do it. It also means that the person has high ideals but lacks the ability. The Japanese reading of the phrase is "me taka ku te hiru shi" ("eyes are high, hands are low"). ([Sanseido Shinmeikai 4-character phrase dictionary https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E7%9C%BC%E9%AB%98%E6%89%8B%E4%BD%8E/])

There are cases where "[conscious]", which is supposed to be positive, is used negatively in the form of "[conscious]", which is confusing, but I thought "[conscious, hands are low]" was fine.
