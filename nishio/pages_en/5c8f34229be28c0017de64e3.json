Self-promotion and branding
I saw the statement "[self-promotion] is not [branding]" and felt uncomfortable, so I drew it.

	It is often observed that there is a phenomenon of [dislike] toward those who have no ability, but only a large appeal.
	On the other hand, we often observe people who are competent but lose out due to poor appeal.
	Some people think, "I don't want to appeal, but I do want people around me to recognize my abilities."
		But people around you are not that interested in you.
		The fallacy that "if you improve your competence, you will be recognized" is similar to "if you make a good product, you will sell it."
		Most people are not capable of correctly perceiving the competence of others.

	[Competence must be demonstrated through results.
		Just because you think you are "competent" doesn't mean you are well-informed.
		Because it is possible for people who are not competent to falsely believe that they are competent.
		[Dunning-Kruger effect]

	But [the opportunity] to get results is not given equally.
		[Opportunity is a scarce resource.
		Basically, society is [a] competitive environment.
		Not even equal opportunities to grow in competence.
