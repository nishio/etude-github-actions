 *1352558205*"Not confident" is too confident.
 I was reading the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4901679252/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=4901679252&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">The Heart is an Illness - Useful Early Buddhist Dharma Talks <2></a>".
 
 It is not an exact quote, so if you want to know the exact wording, read p.60 to about page 3.

 The reason people lose confidence is that they have too much confidence.
 
 When one thinks he or she can finish this level of work in a jiffy, but it doesn't work out when he or she actually does it, one loses confidence.
 
 You think, "I'm going to give an outstanding speech," and then you actually don't speak well, and you lose confidence.
 
 The delusional self is too wonderful to be true, so it tries to behave the way its "delusional wonderful self" behaves and suffers because it can't.
 
 The reason you say, "I'm not confident in my work," is because you have delusions in your head of miraculous success. You can only do what you can do in reality. You can only do what you can do. Aim for a state in which you feel that you have done your best.

 After all, I had too much confidence in myself and had a false self-image that I could write smoothly if I wanted to. However, when I actually started writing, I struggled and could not finish in the scheduled time at all. In order to distract myself from this "inconvenient truth," I unconsciously avoid writing itself. This is the mechanism of so-called "escaping from reality.

 It seems that early Buddhism has a life-hack aspect of how to control these "not good feelings". Interesting.
