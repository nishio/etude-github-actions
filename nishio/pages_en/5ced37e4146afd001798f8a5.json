Execution of PaperScript
It is possible to give the code of [PaperScript] in [Paper.js] directly and execute it.
http://paperjs.org/reference/paperscript/
The advantage is that operators are defined for vectors
The disadvantage is the loss of TypeScript protection.
Well, I guess I don't need PaperScript.
