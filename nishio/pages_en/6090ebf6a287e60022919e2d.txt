 TODO: Find out how to send book parcels
 
 *1209178837* inadvertently
 
 Missed the transfer station.
 
 *1209179882* Shinbashi
 
 I missed the train due to the common blunder of scattering the contents of my bag. Surprisingly, there were many nice people in Tokyo.
 
 *1209225730*[ja]
 At a reception for the 1,000 Speakers Conference, we talked a lot about the Japanese language and had a lot of fun, and it was suggested that we should write about such topics on the blog at least once in a hundred times.
 
 In addition, I'll just summarize the stories that came out today and what I just remembered.
 
 Busy: "busy" written as "mind dead".
 Hair: Hair is your long friend.
 Ephemeral: One's dreams are fleeting
 戀戀 : how to remember the old Chinese character "戀戀" of love: the heart that says "itoshii, itoshii".
 Tao: How to remember Tao in Tao: "Samurai's whistle is one inch" in Sansui bias. It is useless because most people nowadays cannot read 吋(inch).
 Love: love is sincerity, love is ulterior motive (love has the heart in the middle, but love has the heart in the lower half of the body)
 Favor: "favor" as in "favoring" is erotic.
 Happy: I'm happy when a woman is happy.
 Belief: believing what people say
 Profit: Make money by creating followers.
 Disturbance: a bug got into the horse's astride and made a big fuss.
 Whisper: Put your mouth to your ear and whisper. Even if you think you are whispering, three people hear you.
 Sou: the heart for the other person
 Spit: spit that drips from the mouth
 Lesser: less powerful
 False: everything a person does is full of falsehood
 Holy: The Holy King hears and speaks
 Kimikazu Taniguchi: Haherorohamu
 
 *1209226537*[en]variant kana
 The story about the old hiragana is
 http://www10.plala.or.jp/koin/koinhentaigana.html
 I thought it would be a good idea to Google "variant kana" with reference to
 
 Hiragana was not adopted in 1900 when the "Enforcement Regulations for Elementary School Ordinances" were issued to unify the many types of hiragana used for a single pronunciation at the time. In other words, it is a culture that was lost due to "Yutori Education". If you start saying that, there are many things that were lost in the process of unification, such as "katsuo" instead of "katsuo" in the first place.
 
 *1209228674* You immediately wrote a review of the book!

 Thank you very much.
 
 >>
 In that light, this book should have been sold as a series of "Introduction to Haskell," "Introduction to Common Lisp," and "Introduction to OCaml," but without the CD-ROM attachment and in a smaller A4 size.
 <<
 
 The fact is that it was already decided at the planning stage that the book would be printed and that a CD would be included. I think the biggest reason for this is that I did not anticipate this kind of content when I accepted the project.
 
 However, it would be quite interesting to start with a short cycle of "Hello, world to prime numbers in Python," "In Chapter 2, we will go on with the contents of Chapter 1 in Java," and "In Chapter 3, we will go on with the contents of Chapter 2 in Python (abbreviated below). I am tired of writing a book, so I'll leave it at that. I am tired of writing books, though, so I would like to take a break for the time being.

 <BODY>Your Japanese language skills are excellent. I have a lot of respect and take my hat off to you, because you have a classical education that I lack. </body>.
