Don't show complacency.
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Don't show complacency.

Do not show complacency.

Do not be dissatisfied with yourself, it is a poor spirit and not self-satisfaction, it is folly. Self-complacency is mostly the result of ignorance. If it does not impair our credibility, it would be happy ignorance without merit. Since one cannot achieve the superlative perfection of others, one is content with whatever mediocre talent one has. Disbelief is wise, even useful, to avert calamity or to comfort when it comes. Even Homer sometimes nodded off, and Alexander fell from his perch and emerged from his illusion. Things depend on many circumstances. What is a victory in one set may cause defeat in another. In all the unruly foolishness, there is still the empty complacency, the blooming, the blossoming, and everything goes to seed.
