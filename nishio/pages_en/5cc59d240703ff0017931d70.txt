(regular) route
	Sequential path is a means of [one-dimensionalization] while [two-dimensional arrangement] remains [one-dimensionalization
	Placement is two-dimensional.
	Humans can only perceive in [one dimension].
	So we'll set up a sequential route.
	That's the purpose of making [one-dimensional text].

	When slides are made into stickies, generate the sequential order according to the order in the original PDF
		That way you can have a sliding display.
		Order in original PDF = [local context].
		[Preserve Local Context]
