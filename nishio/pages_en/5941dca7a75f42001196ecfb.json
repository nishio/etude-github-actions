Two choice questions to elicit metaphors
2015-06-15
Questions that can be answered with yes or no are very easy to answer.
	On the other hand, the question [what is it like?] is a very difficult question to answer.

I just came up with a way to do the [metaphor] question with two choices.
	For example, is it [uncomfortable] to say, "It's like light?"
	It's not clean when we name the metaphor, but it's up to them to decide whether they feel there is or not.
	If you answer no, that's a metaphor, and if you answer yes, you got a [sense word], so you can ask what kind of discomfort it is.

When you are learning at your best, what does it look like?"
	Um, I don't know.
	For example, does it feel strange to say that when you are learning at your best, it is like light?"
	"Well, something's different."
	What kind of 'something different' is that?"
	Light is something that diffuses, but learning is something that gathers around you..."
And.

As I was writing, I wondered, "Do you feel uncomfortable?" I was wondering if there is a possibility that "I don't know" would come back to "Do you feel uncomfortable? It's difficult.

What kind of 'something different' is that?" I'm not sure."

Well, even in that case, it is clear to me that "comparing it to light is not the same thing", so I guess I should just think "well, this is different - so let's move on".
Then would it feel strange to say, for example, that it is like water?"
And.
