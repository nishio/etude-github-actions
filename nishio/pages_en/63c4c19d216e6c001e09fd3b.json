Learn what AI can't do.
>[https://twitter.com/bioshok3/status/1614678836167475203?s=20&t=7lFwYw2mF7cMWp4erhkLLQ @bioshok3]: I feel like talking about how we should do things in the future that AI can't learn and I feel that the talk about learning what AI can't do is a great "adult answer". Since I am a child in mental age, I tend to give a kitchen-sick opinion that we should review the design of society itself because there will be nothing that AI can't do in the future.

When the iPhone 5 SE was released 10 years ago, did you expect that 10 years from now, when you take a photo of a bird or a flower with your iPhone, AI will be able to tell you what it shows? Maybe those people aren't "adults" but rather "an older generation that was [the world changing slowly]."

Whether the advice of someone who thinks "I can predict what will happen in 10 years" is useful or not depends on whether the world is "a predictable world where 10 years from now is an extension of the present" or not. I think not. So I think the advice is useless and rather harmful.

In fact, it is often a matter of "cost structure" rather than simple capability.
