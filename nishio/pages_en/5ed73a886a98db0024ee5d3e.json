concept prototype
	I said "concept prototype" in the sense of a prototype dedicated to communicating a concept, but [contextual prototype] is a mistake
	You got mixed up with [concept proof]([PoC]).
	Long katakana words are confusing, so Japanese aliases are added on this page.
	Context Proto" and "[Conceptual Verification]"
	Are they the same? →No.
	Context prototypes are prototypes to find out how customers would react if you told them about the product, assuming you had one
	　In that sense, it is a kind of verification of the [customer existence hypothesis].
	Concept verification is a broader concept
	　This includes experimenting to see if certain features of the product are feasible.
	　The point of verification is common
