 This is not an issue.
 I want (to) let a lot of people know about X."
 A mere statement of fact, "I think this.
 There is no reason to argue against it.

 A lot of people should know about X."
 This is a close call.
 In many cases, "many people should know X", which is not referred to as legally binding or anything, is not a literal proposition, but a shortened form of "I believe that many people should know X".

 When more people know X, it has a positive effect on their lives."
 This way we can discuss it.

[Feelings] are not [issues].
