Original experiences that changed the world
I thought while watching the animation at SIGGRAPH ASIA 2021 that for many people the [original experience] of [changing the world] might be the moment when they picked up a pen and drew a line when they were a child.

It is not to play with "oil clay, which is prepared for kneading and can only be used for kneading and shaping."
To make a change in one's own hands in one's everyday dwelling or tools used by one's parents with "oil-based markers that can be used to draw lines on anything".

I guess there are those who were then returned with rage and violence for their "world-changing" actions, and those who were receptive and then led to say, "But if you write it here, I'll be in trouble, so you can write it in this [free book]"!
　(Is it [double-bind]-like to be given a free book and ordered to "write freely" after being violated back and atrophied by free action?)

relevance
　[The process of acquiring the belief that one can change the world.

(By the way, I wonder if that animation will eventually be published somewhere so that we can link to it from here?)
