The maximum matching of a bipartite graph is the matroid crossing of a partitioned matroid pair
from [matroid].

　Focusing on the V1 side vertex, only one edge at most comes out of one vertex.
　　In other words [split matroids].
　Same for V2 side
　The edge set that is matching is a common subset of these two
　　In other words [matroid crossover].

	The [maximal matching] problem on [bipartite graph] is the intersection problem of [split matroid] pairs
