Mission of the nameplate
>A nameplate that requires you to turn over the contents under the nameplate every once in a while after you bind the pieces of paper is not a nameplate. It must be a nameplate that allows the user to get a general idea of what is contained in the package without looking at the contents. ([Sequel to "Idea"] p.47)

This is the reason why we have to make the nameplates strictly in [KJ method of beginning]. On the contrary, the reason why we say "you don't have to make the nameplate strictly" in [Exploration Net] and other places is because we don't bundle them.
