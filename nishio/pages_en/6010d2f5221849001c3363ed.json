It looks like pytest-cov was included with [pytest] when it was installed.
 I saw an article by someone who tried it with unittest, but the coverage report format is the same, so I guess it works either way.

　If you remove this, the highlight will disappear, and if you update it, the highlight will be updated as well.

If you don't limit it with `--cov=<source-dir>`, it tries to output coverage of all the contents of external libraries as well, and it's heavy.

The Git diff view was also highlighted and chaotic.
