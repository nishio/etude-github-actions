The "obviously good" trap.
 If something is obviously good, let's suspect an oversight.
 If it is so obviously good for everyone, why untouched?
 	A lucrative opportunity that was clearly lucrative for everyone was brought to you. Why did it come to me instead of being taken by someone else?
  There are clearly some improvements that could be made that would be better this way. Why is no one leaving it undone?
