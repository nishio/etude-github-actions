 id:yoshiori , I just noticed that no matter how you look at it, it looks like she is trying to take a sneak peek inside her skirt. I'm glad the police didn't catch me before I climbed Mt.

 If you apply in advance on a specific day, you can <del>strike</del> practice at this waterfall.
 
 
 
 Unfortunately, the batteries ran out, so there are not many pictures.

 Summit. There were an estimated 1,000 people at the summit. I'm not kidding, really. There were people enjoying chatting over drinks around Ayu Tsukimiya's figurines. There were also many stores and a big van parked next to the stores. I was tired, so I decided to take the cable car back home, but they were handing out numbered tickets, and the one I got was number 16, and the one currently being guided was number 7, meaning that the cable car would take over an hour. That meant it would take more than an hour. Well, is this Disneyland?
 
 
 It was different from what I had imagined in many ways. I had brought chocolates just in case I got lost. I saw three emergency vehicles carrying injured people on the way.
 
 The paved road and the summit were full of people, but the plaza a little ways up Road 6 was flat and spacious, so I thought it would be a good place for a book club if I brought a sheet to put down.
 
 After that, we played billiards and darts in Shibuya, I don't remember why. I ran out of last train. I reached a dead end at Kiyosumi-Shirakawa. Cab cost 2,000 yen.

 <body>When was the last time you climbed Mt. I think it was quite a while ago, in the 1970's, when the paths were already quite well maintained, so it is easy to imagine the situation that Nisio describes. </body>
