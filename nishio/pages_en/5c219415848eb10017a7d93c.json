Distinction between capitalists, managers and the wealthy
>In many cases, there is no distinction between [capitalists], [managers], and [the wealthy] in [disparity]-type discussions. This seems to have deep roots. It is hard to understand that we are not taking the first step in the principle of "know him, know yourself, and you will not be in danger of fighting a hundred battles.

I see, you don't distinguish between words. Makes sense.

When I was talking about "[self-management strategies]" and "I, the manager, am responsible for the management of my economic entity," some people started talking about capitalists and wealthy people, and I wondered what they were talking about. I wondered.

When a stranger suddenly started throwing out a barrage of stories about disparities, I responded, "It's subjective to you, so I don't disagree," to which he replied, "You probably grew up in a bong anyway, didn't you?" I replied, "It's your subjective opinion, so I don't disagree with it.
