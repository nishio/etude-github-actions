elimination of conflicts
When I use these words, my brain is imagining [cessation]([Aufheben]) and [dialectical development] in [dialectics], but if I use these words without explanation to people who don't share my background, they won't get it, and it's not worth explaining, so I think "I [resolve] [conflict], so I [resolve] [conflict I'm [resolving] the [conflict] because I'm [resolving] the [conflict]" is fine.

The [pattern of change], in which [thesis] and [antithesis] are [aufheben] and [zinthesis] is [aufheben], is everywhere for those who can see it, but there are many people who cannot [notice] it.
