Swamps that misidentify what they don't want to do as what they do want to do.
A state of believing that "this is what I want to do" when in fact I don't want to do so much.
　They say they want to do it, but they don't want to do it inside, so they don't act on it.
　No action is taken, so the situation does not change and remains in that state.
　It would be better to find something else that you want to do more of and move on, but people with serious illnesses are so convinced that this is what they want to do that they can't get out. and neglect the search for other things they might want to do.

At first I was going to write "misidentified as [human bug]," but it didn't feel right, so I changed it to [swamp].
