Controller is gone.
	We've had both the main camera and the [OVRCameraRig] camera.
 	The location was a little off.
 Delete the main camera after adding OVRCameraRig, as it should be removed.
 Controller is gone.
 Cause: The coordinates of the controller are at the exact same position as the OVRCameraRig camera, so it is not visible.
  Move it to the appropriate position in Scene, and the controller will appear on the screen in Game.
  (0.2, -0.2, 0.5).
  I didn't realize it was because of the camera change because the two cameras were looking in the same direction.
