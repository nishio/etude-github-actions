rule of right
This word, in today's Japanese, is being used in contradiction to the idiom "[no royal road to learning]", isn't it?
The path chosen by the public at large is called the "King's Road". It is not the way of kings. It's like the hustle and bustle of a crowded main street.

There is no royal road to learning" means that even kings have no choice but to proceed steadily like the general public when it comes to learning.
