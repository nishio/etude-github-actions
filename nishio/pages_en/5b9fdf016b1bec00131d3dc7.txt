 [Create customers.
  Cut out your weaknesses and develop your strengths.
 For human beings to be happy.
  My first encounter with [Drucker
   I must have read it in college, but I don't remember anything about it.
    >like reading a textbook on a sport you've never experienced.
   I read it again when I was put in charge of my parents' business, but it didn't ring a bell.
   When I read it again when I had almost 100 employees, I had a different impression.
    A sense of crisis where failure is fatal
    >Drucker explains what I have been doing theoretically and clearly.
    There is a posteriori verbalization occurring for the experience.
 The main actors are "[knowledge workers]."
 [A company is a public institution.
