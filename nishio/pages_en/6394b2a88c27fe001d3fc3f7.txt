Diary 2022-12-11

End of [Scrapbox auto-generated diary period
　Automatic generation started [diary 2022-05-21].

How did it end?
　5 of the Top 30 cards are empty diary pages
　　Well, I guess I used up all my energy at the [KJ method study group @ Loftwork] and didn't get around to writing my diary.

		　On the personal project side, the diary page is being generated as empty.
  　　Do you think we could reprint the diary here?

  	I'm sure there's a lot of experimentation going on when API submissions are available.
   On the other hand, I remember "Putting in mechanically generated content makes it look like a garbage dump.
   I thought this was [trashed] too, which I wrote about yesterday.
   　>In the personal project, the diary page is being generated with an empty page.
		 Empty diary pages are "mechanically generated pages of low quality."
		 　I feel like it's okay to have low quality as long as it doesn't get in the way[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
		 　　There's a sense of "[being used by a machine]" with an empty page on the top page and me yesterday thinking, "It's not good that it's empty, so I should fill it in."[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　I don't think you need to make one diary page every day.
　　Especially if they leave it empty.
　　I'd be able to write at least one piece a week that says, "I was busy this week with what?"
　　I think we should do it at least once a week.
