Only performance perpetuates.
To last forever, one must be prepared to last forever. Only [excellence] matters, only achievement endures. Profound intelligence is the only foundation for [immortality].



from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Slowly and surely.
lvii 

The sooner, the better. The sooner we do it, the sooner we can undo it. To last forever, one must be prepared to last forever. Only excellence matters; only achievement endures. Profound intelligence is the only foundation for immortality. Things of much value cost much. Precious metals are the heaviest.
