Flopping down and accumulating
[https://gyazo.com/d34b7541118136a74026b4532c0d90dc]

I have a mental model of "flopping down and [accumulating]" for one phase of [intellectual production].
　This phase cannot be rushed.
　If the quantity is increased in a hurry, the quality is reduced

　Even if the rate of flopping down is constant, there is a difference in the "amount of accumulation" when compared after a long period of time between those who "throw away without accumulation" and those who "accumulate properly".
　[keep a large network and cut out as needed].
　　This "keep" is equivalent to "accumulate."
