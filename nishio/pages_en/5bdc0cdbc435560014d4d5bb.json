	Interesting: [How to handle ideas in WorkFlowy and Scrapbox - R-style https://rashita.net/blog/?p=26040]
 Forcing a [tree structure] on a [relationship] that is essentially a [network] leads to [disconnection of relationships]. #Forcing a tree
 Forcing [finitization of pages] on content that is inherently unlimited and connected leads to a [loss of listability]. #finitization #listability #unlimited #connectedness
 	I wonder if the fact that the unit of relation description is based on [per page] (even though there are line permalinks) is a continuation of the [Wiki] convention.
	The existence of the relationship being [boolean] is another kind of [restriction].
 On the other hand, [KJ method] has a limitation that [sticky size] is not suitable for long content #Content size limitation
 To solve the [disconnection] problem caused by [treeing], we can introduce [inter-node links].
 For the [finitization] problem caused by [page], we can introduce [link expansion].
 As for the [minute limit] issue, we can introduce links to unrestricted sources.
