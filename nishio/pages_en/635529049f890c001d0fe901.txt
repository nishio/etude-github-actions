　190 GST as of 10/5, so 472 GST more in 18 days.
　　If I had walked the full distance, it would have been 900, so I just took it easy. It was raining, too.
	Picking up a mystery box.
	　This opens over time, you can pay GST to open it faster, but I've never done it.
	　A shabby box will lose like, you pay 5 GST to open it and get 2.3 GST.
	　　However, we cannot throw it away.
	　I don't do anything in particular, but I seem to be getting better and better boxes, I wonder if it depends on the amount of walking from the start of the game.

My main sneakers have fewer hit points.

　363mSOL for a Lv2 comfort gem used to recover about 30%.
　However, I don't want to have to recover until it's below 20% because there doesn't seem to be any disadvantage other than not being able to trade in the market.
　Looks good to use until 0% as the sneakers will increase in mint from now on, and then sneaker burns without recovery.

I got four gems.

　Sometimes they come out of the mystery box.
　It's sold at 0.01 SOL, so it's not a big deal.
　Rough Approximate Amount
　　1 ETH = $1349
　　1SOL = $34
　　1mSOL = 1GST = about 5 yen
　　20mSOL = 1GMT = about 200 yen
　472 GST and 4 gems, roughly $2,500 income.

I was going to mint it, but I didn't raise the level.

They said I'm missing a scroll, even though I bought one?

Ah, I see. That's how it works.

　Scrolls of commons cost more than scrolls of uncommons.
　　Common was probably more consumptive and reversed.
　　Opposite of naming...
