intellitech 増補改訂版を作る
	I thought I had written a book on "knowledge that won't be obsolete for 10 years."
 　The obi says as much.
  This is only a hypothesis and must be tested
  	Verification improves understanding.
 Therefore, it is necessary to review it after 10 years and verify what has become obsolete and what has not.
  [時の試練]
 If so, why not just publish an enlarged and revised edition at that time?

feedback
	Why not give it 3 years instead of 10?
  Isn't it a little early for that?
		The life cycle of a paper book is long, so maybe we should do it a little slower, but keep doing it online.
 	[Publication is not a goal, but a start.]
  	The idea is that [the expanded and revised edition is an upgrade].
