private/public分断

When doing the [writing out method], instruct them to write down anything that comes to mind, without thinking, "Is it OK to publish this or that?

However, in services where information is separated by public/private, this is disconnected.
It is inevitable that "non-language" cannot be put on the service, but the public/private split is a design problem that can be solved.

Shouldn't everything that is output go into the "personal/private" space by default?
	This solves the "[where to write]" problem.
	Attribution of information "to publish or not to publish" should be decided after the fact.
		[Information should be determined after the fact.]
		Even if it's published after the fact, it's not moving to another space.
			All together subject to search
			[One pocket principle.]
			In other words, not "private group/public group" # False dichotomy
				A default private group that includes everything and a select group of publicly available items, the former encompassing the latter.

I was thinking about the design of [Regroup].
