Solve for each connected component.
Given a graph that is not necessarily connected, it is often the case that when it is divided into connected components, the different connected components do not affect each other
In that case, if you first divide the graph into [connected components] and then solve them individually, it will be easier to solve the graph with the restriction that it is a connected graph.

If it is a consolidation, for example
　There are trees throughout the area.
　V-1 or more sides
　If the edge is V-1, it is a tree
