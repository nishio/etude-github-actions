	Chief Editor [Noriko Matsuda].

	A story about how the author, who was never good at [tidying up], improves the messy rooms of two friends.
	The editor in charge is different, but the chief editor, [Noriko Matsuda], is the one who wrote [What you need immediately! The art of organizing things that you can get out easily!] She was the one who gave advice on tidying up in the book.

	I don't know why I can't get the small stuff done.
		â†’No energy left to decide where to go.
		If you don't know where to put it, put it in the right place.
		That's why it's uncluttered.

	Don't move around.
		Because [people unconsciously avoid things that are difficult to judge].

	It is difficult to decide where to store them.
		Trying to decide whether to throw something away or not and deciding where to store it can be confusing if you're trying to do both at the same time.

	I have to do it right."
