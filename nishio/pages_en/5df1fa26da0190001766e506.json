Verbal communication disappears, written communication does not.

	[Shibuya Ward Office" is changing drastically with IT. Business chat eliminates 'I told you so' and 'I didn't tell you so'ï½œ BUSINESS INSIDER JAPAN https://www.businessinsider.jp/post-203538]
That's exactly what I was talking about [the benefits of text communication] at a recent public lecture.

>Now we will see what advantages there are to communicating through the written word, and there are tremendous benefits. Therefore, I would like you to know about them. Digital written communication, unlike voice communication, has two advantages: it does not disappear and it is searchable. What I mean by "indelible" is that the voice disappears. What I am talking about here now is voice communication, but let's say you suddenly have a stomach ache, go to the restroom, and come back. During that five-minute period, you would no longer know what I had said. The voice disappears. Therefore, communication by voice requires that you be in the same place at the same time. If I go to the restroom for a minute from this location, I will no longer know what I am talking about here.
