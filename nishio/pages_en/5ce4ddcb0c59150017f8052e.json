>I did some background reading on Jiro Kawakita, and I think some background needs to be included. Kawakita had an enormous influence on Western thinking on management, and the KJ method has been adopted as the 'affinity diagram'. I think this term needs to be included, and I think a brief explanation should be given about how the KJ method is used in project management and in management in general, and then how it can be adapted to writing - which is what you did. So I think Westerners need to know how much the KJ method has already been adopted in western thought. I'm not expressing myself well here.

[nishio.icon]About 'affinity diagram', I see, I just imported the book "Brassard, M. (1989) The Memory Jogger Plus. GOAL/QPC: Methuen, Massachusetts." which introduce the KJ method as the affinity diagram in English.

Affinity diagram: The diagram is also just one part of the whole diagram, so I am not suggesting changing the name 'KJ method'. I think that should stay the same, but reference should be made to the affinity diagram.
