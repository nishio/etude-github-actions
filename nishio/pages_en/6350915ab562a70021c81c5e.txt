[Gairoseki] Boom again!
　I've been working from home for too long and my smoothness is getting worse.

Today's Nishio Family
I said, "I met a friend and told him that [the primate of all things is] a cat."
Wife: "[Cat] and [corn] are sharing the earth peacefully."
I said, "Which way is up?"
Wife: "Neither one is better than the other, both are the type to ignore things that don't concern them."
The very concept of [the primate of all things] was tainted by the idea of homo sapiens trying to put a pecking order between species! Real higher beings were not interested in up or down!

The tote bag is ready.
