 A design workshop called <a href='http://www.design.kyoto-u.ac.jp/summer-school2013/ja/index.html'>Kyoto University Summer Design School 2013</a> will be held for three days from tomorrow, September 25 to 27. If you were unable to attend the three-day workshop, or if you found that the application deadline has already passed, we have good news for you.
 
 On Thursday mornings from 10:00-11:00, I will be giving a "mini-lecture" titled "How to Write Down Ideas and Structure Them. The content of this lecture is a condensed version of brainstorming, writing out ideas, and the KJ method. The mini lecture can be observed by applying at the registration desk on the day of the event. If you are interested, please consider it.
