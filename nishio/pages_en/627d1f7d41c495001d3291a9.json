Organizing information into known categories can keep new discoveries away.
>We may create a snapshot-like tree for the output we need at a given time, but we are not concerned with keeping the whole thing neatly organized. As Yukio Noguchi once wrote in his "[Super] Organizing Method", categorizing and organizing for the sake of searching will result in futility, and organizing will put information into known categories, rather than keeping it from new discoveries.

> While the hypothesis that "much of what we call ideas comes from this forced simplification" may indeed be true, I have a feeling that poor organization may ultimately cause us to fall back on known categories. In order to discover something new, categories must consequently be traversed.
