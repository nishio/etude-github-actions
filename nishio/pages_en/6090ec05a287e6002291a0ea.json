 *1281163765*OSC LIST
 I want to control sound as cleanly as possible via sockets in a Linux environment. I'll write down what I've found out in my research.
 - OSC (OpenSound Control) and OSS (Open Sound System) are confusingly different, so be careful not to confuse them.
 - Even if you look at the OSC specifications, you can't figure out how to make a sound at all. This is not surprising, OSC is like HTTP, and no matter how much you look at the HTTP specification, you will not find how to use the Twitter API.
 - <a href='http://danielnouri.org/docs/SuperColliderHelp/Tutorials/Tutorial.html'>SuperCollider 3 Server Tutorial - SuperCollider 3.2 help files</a>, but when I first read it, I went through the motions of "No, I don't want to use this kind of proprietary language, I want to hit it via UDP from another language," but it's actually pretty close to my goal. I don't want to just control the ON/OFF of it after making a definition with a frequency definite, I want to control the frequency itself. The definition itself should be able to be sent from another program via UDP, but I wonder what to do.
