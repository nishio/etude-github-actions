>[https://twitter.com/korimakorima/status/1627470764248297472?s=46&t=f7k1b8QJEW7QaF9kn1mNZA @korimakorima]: I thought the conversation with AI would be like a short story by [Shinichi Hoshi]. I thought the conversation with AI would be like a short story by [Shinichi Hoshi], in which you either feel good by getting full affirmation of yourself, or you feel relieved by having AI decide your future actions! It's only in the hands of humans", and I'm rolling in the direction of having AI make me feel good with a sense of [superiority] over it. Domination is pleasure.

Ah, I see.　Some people use it to feel superior by making fun of it?
 I feel like [my self-esteem] gets shredded when I can't find the point [to make fun of] anymore.

How to use AI
　Create an environment that facilitates [awareness] (I mainly use this method?)
　Receive [affirmation
　Receive [decision
　Feel superior by making fun of them.
