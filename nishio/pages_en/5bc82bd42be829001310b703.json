Self Search Engine
	I want a system that remembers the book, my past blog posts, other people's posts, etc., reads what I'm thinking now, and presents associations from there.
 	The Poor implementation of this is "[search engine]" where I type in a keyword and it returns a sentence containing that keyword.
  Shouldn't there be this Poor "search engine" first?

	Actually, there is a program to quickly search in the data folder with silver_searcher.
 	The book PDF is output as one line per page, so you can tell which page of the book you are on by looking at the file name of the hit and its line number
  What is lacking in this?

	Unknown means of keeping up-to-date
 	I've already forgotten the last time I made the data because it's been so long ago.
  	You're supposed to use [dumpfb] to make Facebook a search target...
   I wonder how far books have been added to the search...
  The type of data source that can't be made public is not written in a public place, so I forget about it myself.
  	It should be written even if it is private.
   Better to publish what can be published and let Google and other searches do the rest.

	You have to decide on a query.
		For example, I just wrote this much in Scrapbox, and I want to be able to search "this entire sentence" as a query with one click.
