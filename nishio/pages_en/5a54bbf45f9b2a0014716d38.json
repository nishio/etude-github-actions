Ising Programming Club
 Call for Participants
 Context: [programming quantum computers].
 References: [Ising formulations of many NP problems https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843]
	Memo [Ising formulations of many NP problems].
 I won't read it without a deadline, so if you get a few people interested, we'll set up a date and I'll present one chapter per person, so how about that?
	Create chat (Slack), Scrapbox
 Let's recruit participants for a winter Prosin or something like that.
 I think it would be better to start with a few people who know each other, because it is difficult to manage a group of people properly.
 	No matter how big we get, we don't want to exceed 30 people.
