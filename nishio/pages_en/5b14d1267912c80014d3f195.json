Q: What is the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence?
A:
	The term "artificial intelligence" is just a market that is gaining momentum, but there is no clear definition of the term.
 Machine learning is, roughly speaking, what a machine acquires from data instead of a human describing the conditions of a conditional branch.

	Logistic regression 1958
	Decision Tree Decision Tree
 	humanly interpretable.


	How can probability be known?
 	Of course you can't know.
  We can only talk about the results of the experiment, which is what percentage of the data we put into the identifier that we put away for the experiment, and what percentage of the data we identified correctly.
  If you get 80% correct on that data, there is no guarantee that you will get 80% correct on the new data you are given.

	What are the synonyms for scripting language?
 Interpreter and compiler languages

	CNN is beyond the precision of human thought rules.

	What are the parameters and where are the parts?
 	[$ y = a x^2 + b x + c]
		where a, b, and c are the parameters
  The working hypothesis, "Let's express the relationship between y and x in this kind of equation," is the model.
　Deep Learning is just a more complex version of this equation.
 　Same as regression in terms of selecting optimal parameters based on input data

	The evolution of memory has also played a major role in the spread of scripting languages
 Until now, limited memory had to be used properly.
 The abundance of memory has made it possible to make messy arrangements and let the machine do the work.
