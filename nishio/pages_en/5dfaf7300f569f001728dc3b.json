Good representation of [two types of notices
>[nishio.icon]>"Bringing private communication to public channels increases the amount of information and prevents it from being passed around" is a problem with the system's inability to distinguish between the two types of notifications, but it doesn't seem to be well recognized, so I'll summarize it later.

>[katzchang https://twitter.com/katzchang/status/1207502892501852160?s=21]That's the difference between "[you may look]" and "[I want you to look]"

--- context
>[yoshikig https://twitter.com/yoshikig/status/1207475270757675013] While there are arguments against Slack's Private Channel/DM, our company's communication is still based on DM (Gmail/Hangout), and I think that even if we tried to bring it all to a public channel, the amount of information would be too much to keep up with. I think that if we tried to make it a public channel, the amount of information would increase too much and it wouldn't work. I guess it depends on what kind of organization you want to build.
