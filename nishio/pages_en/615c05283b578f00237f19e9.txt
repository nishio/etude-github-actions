A place to grow the active top 1%.
>Ukai: This is something I have experienced through my involvement in education at programming classes, but in Japan, there are very few places that nurture the [* top 1% of children]. This [top tier] does not refer to children who excel in passive education such as taking entrance exams, but rather those who excel in the sense of "[being able to think for themselves and create products with their hands]". If they go on to university or graduate school, they can engage in high-quality discussions in laboratories and at academic conferences, but there is no such place for elementary, junior high, and high school students. We thought that if we want to develop the top class, we should provide [* opportunities for high-quality discussions] and [opportunities for output]. That is exactly what [Unexplored] exists for."
> --especially [* public school education is tailored to children who are the slowest in progress], and there are not many opportunities for elementary or junior high school students to learn what "argumentation is" in the first place, are there?
