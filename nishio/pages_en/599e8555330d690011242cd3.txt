78 why, if you don't connect with the experience.

80 why, if you don't connect with the experience.
While it cannot be applied, rooted knowledge, which is abstracted from one's own experience, can be applied to other slightly different situations by following the path down to the rooted knowledge application.

81 experience if we don't connect with it.
Rooted knowledge with no applicationApplied rootless knowledgeSolving 100 math homework problems is not the objective, it is only a means to an end. The objective is to gain the ability to apply the skills to solve problems that have never been seen before in entrance exams. However, Nada does not use that strategy because having students memorize charted solution methods does not produce results. The strategy is to solve a lot of problems and develop understanding within oneself. This strategy has been useful, at least as far as Nada's success record is concerned.

82 experience if not tied to it.
Rootless knowledge with no roots that can't be applied Rooted knowledge Let me explain why this is on the dotted line. I have a couple of experiences, but if you don't get yourself one step below abstract knowledge, the "connection" doesn't happen when you are exposed to abstract knowledge. If it doesn't happen, you forget it immediately. Application! Now that Mr. Kawachi has mentioned his real-life experience of studying mathematics at Nada, I think it will be easier for me to make the connection and remember it.
