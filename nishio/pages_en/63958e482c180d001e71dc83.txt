Weekly note 2022-12-11
[What is the Weekly Journal?]
　Diary-like pages that stay on the same page for a week
　When the quantity is too large, it is cut out as needed.
　We'll do it manually for a while, there's no need to rush to automate something that's about 50 sheets to what?
next [Weekly Report 2022-12-18].

This week's schedule
　Monday, chatty event
　Tuesdays, meetings, presentations, events
　Friday, study group presentation


from [/villagepump/2022/12/10]
 I want to move the above Cybozu-style series to Scrapbox.
 	✅[How to learn mathematics].
 I want to fix the broken link in the image of the [Technium] story [Technology and Innovation Commentary].
 　This is a leftover from the days when PDFs were converted to images and then placed on your own server instead of on Gyazo.
 　This is what happened when Chrome started rejecting HTTP images for embedding into HTTPS services.
 Commentary on BERT when it came out 4 years ago, now that ChatGPT has taken off, it's "I didn't think this would happen 4 years ago", but I just put the link to the PDF, so I want to make it a little better.
 　[BERT and Transformer]
 　Or an explanation of the attention mechanism used in Stable Diffusion, etc.
	Did I download all the Slideshare PDFs in the first place?
  These "broken image links" and "just put a link to a PDF" types.
  　I guess the best thing to do now is to put it in Gyazo.
　Increased desire to organize information
　　[/villagepump/ appropriate cut-outs are determined after the purpose of the reuse is determined].
　　[/villagepump/ search to fly to it and then hang around in the related links to find it].
　On the personal project side, the diary page is being generated as empty.
　　Do you think we could reprint the diary here?
　A mission to clean [black stains in the bathroom] in [general cleaning].
