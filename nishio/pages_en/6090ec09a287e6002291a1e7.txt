 *1325153930* "There are 11 of us!" reads.
 I read it because my wife, who likes Hogan and Egan, recommended it to me. "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4091910114/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative =7399&creativeASIN=4091910114">There are 11 of them! </a>"
 I had heard the name before, but this was the first time I had read it. And this was undeniably science fiction, despite its apparent shoujo manga-like appearance. As a practical test for the final stage of the space university entrance exam, a group of 10 people who have never met before are told to spend about 50 days safely in one spaceship, but when they start, there are 11 of them for some reason! Who is the eleventh? This is a story with a mystery flavor. It was quite interesting. By the way, I just looked at Wikipedia and it completely spoiled the story, so don't look at it before reading it.

 The following is a casual conversation between the couple:
 I saw a 28 year old in a contact ad on the street and I was like, "28... eyes!"
 Wife: "Isn't that two too many!"
 I said, "There are 14 of us!"
