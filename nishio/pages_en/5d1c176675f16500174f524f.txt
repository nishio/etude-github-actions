useless
When the statement is made, "This method is useless," it is not meant literally.
It means, "The speaker has never obtained [beneficial results] with this method."

From this observed fact alone, it is impossible to determine whether "this approach does not produce [beneficial] results for anyone" or "[the speaker's] lack of ability.

digression
	If person X says, "Method A is useless, Method B is also useless, ..." and accumulates many cases of "never getting useful results", resulting in an increase in certainty of X's lack of ability.
		When he said, "Method A is useless," I assume he intended to lower Method A.
		However, as a result of the act of speaking out, my reputation, not method A, goes down.
			Intended and opposite effect, interesting. [Human bug].
