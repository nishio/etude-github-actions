 *1272012997* Bought domain from Google.
 id:hagino_3000 told me "buying a domain from Google is easy, just check the box to not list in WHOIS and they will set up Google Apps for you", so I bought it. When I tried to add my Apps right after registration, I was sent to MarketPlace, which was confusing. It seems that this happens only when the registration of the domain is not completed. I'll wait for a while.
 
 The domain was registered in about 30 minutes. When I registered a domain name with Name.com before, I had to go through a lot of hassle to confirm the ownership of the domain name, but when I bought it through Google, I didn't have to do that.
 
 One thing I couldn't figure out was how to log in to godaddy.
 >>
 Advanced DNS settings
 Sign in to godaddy to change your MX records, CNAME and other advanced DNS settings.

 You can see how to log in to godaddy by clicking on the "How to log in to godaddy" link. By the way, when I registered my App with foo.bar.com, it automatically put cname foo ghs.google.com in the DNS. The fact that I couldn't access and see it right away is simply because the DNS is taking a long time to update, so I guess I just need to take my time and wait.
