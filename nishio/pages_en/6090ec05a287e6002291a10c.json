 If you do this, you will be told "Bareword "Counter" not allowed" when using strict; if you use bless $counter, "Counter";, you will be fine.
 
 I want to explicitly bless packages and references for the sake of explanation, but what about doing it with strings? Should I explicitly bless the package with a string so as not to mislead people into thinking that the package is a first-class object, or should I do it with a bareword so as not to distract them from other things? Of course, normally I would call it Counter->new or something like that, so I guess there is no practical case where this would be a problem.

 	my $class = shift;
 	my $values = {count => shift};
 	bless $values, $class;
     }

 $counter->push; # 1 fish
 $counter->push; # 2 animals

 $c2->push; # 1 fish

 <body>Bareword "Counter" is actually evaluated as a string, so you can simply write "Counter". <br><br>By the way, if a package called Counter already exists, <br>bless $counter, Counter::; can be used even if it is used strictly. </body>

 <body>We will write "Counter" in a straightforward manner! </body>.
