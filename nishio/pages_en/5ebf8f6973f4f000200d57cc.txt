Six years ago ([2014-05-06]) I lost weight just by weighing myself frequently and being aware of it, but now I don't lose weight, but rather gain it slightly. Is this the decrease in basal metabolism due to aging? So I went for a walk to complete the Apple Watch ring for the first time in a week. I can't walk leisurely because I don't have enough intensity, and I can't run because I don't have enough energy, so I ran 100 steps and when my heart rate exceeded 150, I did the activity of walking until my heart rate reached 130.
