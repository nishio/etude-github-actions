Velocity measurements for presentation preparation
[Velocity] Actual measured data
	Japanese Presentation
 	70 pages
 	I spoke in 40 minutes.
  準備10時間
  If you want to speak for an hour, you need 135 pages and 15 hours of preparation.
 Presentation with slides that translate it into English
  18 pages in 15 minutes
  	2/3 the speed of Japanese
  If you want to talk for an hour, you need 72 pages.
  The process of machine translating the Japanese slides and then revising them took 1.5 hours to get to page 38.
  So 72 pages would be 3 hours.
		10 hours to prepare 72 pages of slides
  If you speak for one hour, 10 hours to prepare Japanese slides + 3 hours to translate and revise
  Surprisingly, English is less expensive by speaking less?
  The problem is that in English you can only speak 2/3 of what you want to talk about.
  When preparing both English and Japanese content for the same time frame:
  	15 hours to prepare Japanese slides + 4.5 hours to translate and revise + cost to discard 2/3 of speaking in English version
   Hmmm...
	Pointing out that we just need to practice so much that people don't think we are prepared even if we have a manuscript ready to go.
 	The cost of preparing the English version of the slides will increase as a result of fluency, and the practice time cost will be added to the cost.
  If we're going to do that, I'd like to take the video and use it around as content.
		Proposal to first take a video of the Japanese presentation and add subtitles to it.
