Light and dark anger
	I used to think [anger is poison].
	On the other hand, one friend believes that "[anger is] a driving force
	And the friend is using his anger as a driving force to produce results.
	I mean, there is good in anger.
	What is the difference between good anger and bad anger?

	[Heat parable]
		Bright, sunny, dry, dry, dry, hot.
		Dark, cloudy, damp, dank, and hot.
		Both are "hot," but the sensation you get is much different.
		Good anger resembles the former.
		Some of the bad anger resembles the latter.
			Some bad angst not so bad.

	[Steam engine parable]
		The friend, who is motivated by anger, believes he can "change" the object of his anger
			Meaning "can improve what is the object of your anger," not "make something else the object of your anger."
		So anger is the driving force that creates "action to change.
		Zimmering people believe that they cannot "change" the object of their anger.
			We're not discussing here whether it can or cannot actually be changed, we're just talking about personal perception.
			The belief that "I can't change it" is formed by the actual experience of "I can't change it".

		This is like [a steam engine].
			When heat is applied, water turns into steam, creating pressure.
			When this pressure is properly directed, power can be produced, which is the steam engine.
			On the other hand, if there is no place for pressure to escape, it will damage the kettle
				Worst case scenario, it bursts.
			The metaphor of "venting
				Pressure drops as heightened pressure sputters out.
				The goal is to reduce pressure, so I'm not thinking about whether or not that spewed force will be useful motive power.
				It's easier to just let it blow out than to use it as a power source, so it flows that way.
