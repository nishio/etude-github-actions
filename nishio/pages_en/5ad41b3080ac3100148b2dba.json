Some people make the mistake of thinking that when we say, "Let's write down our thoughts and organize them," we mean, "Let's not write the same thing down."
Trying to keep track of "what I've already written" so as not to duplicate it becomes a struggle because there is so much of it.

It is not. You can write the same thing over and over.
Writing the same thing at different times is a sign that it matters.
Duplication helps you discover "what you think is important" and that helps you organize.

The "same thing" is seldom truly 100% exactly the same.
The expressions are usually slightly different.
If you [compare] the similarities of it and think one is better than the other, it will help you realize "what you think is better".

It creates those opportunities, so [duplication] is not something that should be avoided.
You may write anything that comes to mind without worrying about duplication.

  　Talking about how "same" means that X is identical and therefore the gradient cannot be determined, "different" means that X is far apart and therefore the accuracy of gradient estimation is poor, and that it is better to focus on "similar but slightly different".
