Waking up is the best time to catch fish, because while you're sleeping, the fish in the back of your brain are swimming close to the surface.

[fish tank metaphor].
	Unconsciousness = subterranean lake
	Inspiration = Fishes
		come to mind

[It would be good to get organized on the concept of metaphor#619e164aaff09e00002455d5].
	>What "my use of the word metaphor" refers to is the image of a fish that is in the sea of non-verbalized things and sometimes comes up near the surface of the water.
	Sea = unspoken language
	Fish that sometimes come up near the surface = metaphor

	>While I'm talking, I imagine that I'm swimming close to the surface of the sea of "things not yet verbalized," and I scoop them up with a flick.
	Sea = something that has not yet been verbalized
	Fish swimming close to the surface of the ocean as we speak = metaphor
		Scoop it up with a flick

	>I had a sense that I "got" something in the dream, but it disappeared.
　>But it was definitely there, so even if it escaped, it must still be near the surface, and if you write down what you can think of, you might find it again

	>In other words, we used to recognize the metaphor of "catching a big fish under the surface of the water by putting a lot of hooks into it," but that was based on the assumption that we could see the shadow of the fish.
	Big fish with visible fish shadow = barely verbalizable by metaphor, etc.
	Fishing by hitting lots of hooks = lots of tentative verbalizations repeated to cause solid verbalization.
	Some fish don't see fish shadows.
	Separating the sea like a fixed net.
	　Mapping a symbol to a vague [- concept] felt sense, an aspect is created between the symbol and the felt sense it evokes.
	Narrow down the area where fish are likely to be found.
　　To know where things are likely to be, and conversely, where they are not likely to be, by direct matching against what you want to verbalize but have not yet seen.
