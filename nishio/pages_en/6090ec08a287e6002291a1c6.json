 I had been living without a TV for about nine years, but when I recently bought a TV, I was surprised to find that it had become a game console. When I casually turned on the TV, suddenly there was an information screen around the screen, and I could solve puzzles from there!

 I was solving puzzles with my husband and I and our national ranking reached three digits. We both like puzzles but usually play individually, so when we can solve puzzles on TV, we can play cooperatively and enjoy puzzles in a different way.
