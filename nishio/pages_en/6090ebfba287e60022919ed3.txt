 *1224449852*[Mid-term] Examples of Covering Tactics
 <img src="http://gyazo.com/6f8cfcd7f2d787ed9bef568a134588c1.png">
 We had 7, so we should have had 7.
 If you play 7, you can get 7 points no matter what Player3 plays, and if Player2 takes turn 3, you can still get 7 points. You just have to be careful not to take your own turn.
 
 *1224454347*[GAE]offset cannot exceed 1000
 I tried to download the data in an appropriate format to move out of Google App Engine, but when I tried to download the whole data at once, the DataStore timed out, as usual, and when I tried to use an offset argument of fetch, like "100 items from the 1100th item", I got an error message that the offset could not be more than 1000. When I tried to get the whole data at once, as usual, the DataStore timed out. This is a pain in the ass. Is it necessary to throw a query that does not exceed 1000 results? I should use the "game start date/time" which I had only added for some reason but had not used effectively. I guess I haven't played 1,000 games a day yet.
 
 *1224503319*[TOEIC] results came back.
 My TOEIC scores came back. I increased 10 points even though I didn't study at all. Comparison with the last time.
 >||
 LISTENING  	READING  	TOTAL
 +50  	 -40  	 +10
 ||<
 The reason for the drop in my reading score must be because I had to go to the bathroom, but I was on the edge of my time and had to endure it desperately. I'm optimistic that I can gain 40 more points if I take good care of myself. 40 more points would be 5 points below my goal, and like TopCoder, I'm afraid I'll get bogged down right before the goal.
