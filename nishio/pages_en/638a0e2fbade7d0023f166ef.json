Moving from static packages to dynamic interactions
>[https://twitter.com/ochyai/status/1584635226554523648?s=46&t=X7vw5r0nIniXQ10M1UiTvg @ochyai]: If we could generate a paper in 10 seconds that would take 5 days to peer review, would we really read it? Would we really read a paper if we could generate a 60-minute music album in 120 seconds, or would we spend 60 minutes listening to music in an age when a 60-minute album can be generated in 120 seconds? If communication is the main activity of information consumption, we will move from [static packages] to [dynamic interactions].

Independently of the [AI content generation] context, I think we are moving from static packages to dynamic interactions.

The way I see it from my perspective, [legacy format] called [book] is a product for [laggard]. This is the static package.
Conventional SNS, on the other hand, is a dynamic interaction, but it is designed with a very short information lifetime, making it difficult to accumulate and reuse information.
Therefore, we have been accumulating information in the form of a "dynamic information network" that is not a static package in Scrapbox, and reactions are picked up through Twitter ego searches for a while.
In the past few years, with the increased use of Scrapbox as a social networking service, it has become a good idea to use Scrapbox and closed chat for real-time performance. The use of Scrapbox is becoming more and more popular as a social networking service.
