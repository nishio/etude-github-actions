	CI even in embedded systems
  Push to the repository and Jenkins will create a binary.
  Raspi direct connection to microcontroller of installed device (JTAG)
  Raspi writes to microcontroller
  	Jenkins slave running on Raspi
   There is an ARM binary for J-Link.
  	J-Link has binaries for ARM, so you can write microcontrollers from RasPi.
	Raspi collects logs and throws them over the net.

 For hobby purposes, ESP systems that connect to Wifi are popular, but they eat electricity.
 	I like the BLE microcontroller called nRF52.
	Arduino excels when it comes to servos and sensors
 Flow JSON over serial
 	Arduino library is available.
