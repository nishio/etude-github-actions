A few smart people and many dumb people
I think the mental model of "a few smart people and many dumb people" is false.

I thought about this when I saw a Tweet that said, "When I was in elementary school, I asked my teacher, 'Isn't it strange that majority rule means adopting the ideas of the people who are not smart enough to make up the majority? I saw a Tweet to this effect and thought.

I think this mental model looks something like this when drawn in a diagram.

But this is an idea that implicitly assumes that the "smart/smart" axis is the only one that clearly exists.

In fact, here's how it works:.

So who's the smartest in this situation, A, C, or F? Or F?

Most people do not have the ability to identify this.
We judge the world's leading mathematician as someone who mumbles nonsensical gibberish, or the type of person who runs amok when in power as someone who provides powerful leadership.
Humanity has yet to find a solution as to what to do in these situations.

Winston [Churchill] said in 1947.
>Many political systems have been tried and will be tried in this world of error and woe. No one can pretend that [democracy] is perfect and wise. In fact, it is the worst form of government. Except for all the other forms of government that have been tried so far.
Currently, humanity has tentatively adopted democracy. However, it is not perfect, and new methods should be tried and improved in the future. So, in that sense, I expressed that "democracy is the worst political form" compared to the political forms of the future. On the other hand, since all political forms that have been tried in the past are worse than democracy, it also means that "democracy is the best at the present time.

If an elementary school teacher could have told the students that the mental model of "a few smart people and many dumb people" is wrong, that most people cannot distinguish between "smart/smart" and "dumb", and that this is why we use democracy, the students at the beginning of the article might have been convinced. I thought that the elementary school students might have been convinced if the teacher had told them that most people cannot distinguish between "good and bad" and that is why we use democracy.
