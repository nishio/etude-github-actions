What is a drinking party?
What is a [drinking party]?
	The food was introduced as [an excuse object],
	A place that is softly [broken out] by the high cost of moving seats.

A drinking party of 10 people will generate a smaller group on its own.
　Due to difficulty in hearing voices at a distance
	A [Zoom drinking party] of 10 people makes the group too large and interferes with [synchronous communication] by voice.
	A Zoom drinking party of 2-3 people would work.
		but this time, "new combinations with unexpected members" will no longer occur.
　Proposal to randomly assign large numbers of members to small [breakout rooms
 	This causes pain "when you are matched with someone you don't like".
 	Because the "excuse object" of food does not exist, the air of "I have to interact with the people who are there" is generated.
