Automatic path grouping

	Grouping of paths?
		>I'm not happy about anything because only one path is moved, such as an arrow that seems to consist of multiple paths.
		The path down should be implicitly grouped.
		Need [group without nameplate] -> Done
	When flushing the path buffer, add groups with paths as children instead of adding paths individually
　The path buffer flushes were running on both the click of the path button and leaving the path mode, which would draw the same thing twice.
　The leave-from-pass process also runs when the pass button is pressed while in paz mode.
　　Whether the behavior is appropriate...
　　But it's weird that it flashes when I click the pass button to enter paz mode.

Grouping of paths?
	Is it really necessary to be able to "drag a path around?"
		Only one path, such as an arrow that seems to consist of multiple paths, is moved and nothing makes me happy.
	Would we need "paths grouped together?"
		But the group needs a nameplate.
		Are you sure the nameplate is just text?
		Shouldn't the compressed version of the selected path be the default?
		Compression occurs by daring to text.
			Simply making a reduced image is not enough.

	Forcing groupings to have a nameplate is not a good idea.
	Dare to text" → Idea of imposing restrictions on users
	Wouldn't it be nice to have an implicit group at the point of "lasso selection and dragging" in the first place?
		→ I'm having a hard time deciding what kind of UI would be best.
			When clicked, an implicit group that wraps the entire path is displayed.
