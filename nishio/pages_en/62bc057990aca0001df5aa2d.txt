History of Explore-Net
pulse discussion
brainstorming
dot-notes
spatial arrangement
Speech stops.
I can't get the big picture of the opinion.
Grasping the big picture
Seek more heterogeneous opinions
Lots of opinions.
Difficult to do with only relational lines
Need an island torii or nameplate.
integrative color
Methods for collecting multidisciplinary information
touchnetting
Structuring data collected through interviews
Take control of the whole situation on the spot.
Missing data was identified.
Add coverage
Journalism Course
hard to teach
why
Elements of exploratory net thinking are almost identical to the KJ method
Just different combinations and procedures.
It wasn't a clear procedure.
Veteran of the KJ method
Frequent use of authentic KJ methods in the field of practice
the two sects
KJ method = Exploration Net
KJ-method logic
The guilty pleasure of only doing things that have been broken down.
Neither of them have departed from the KJ method perspective.
Can't blame them.
As of 1970, what the hell?
Twin brothers
Collection of diverse and multifaceted information
In Training Guidance.

Same direction as KJ method
Do it in a short time

Exploratory Fireworks
Integrated Fireworks
Named after the fact
Fireworks to think about

Exploratory Fireworks
Fireworks for coverage
Write the theme in the middle
360 degree angle.
Origin of Fireworks
shimadori (Japanese bird, Cynoglossus joyneri)
Don't get hung up on the 2-5 piece guideline for integrated fireworks.
15 sheets is acceptable.
kusabi
Understanding the big picture of data collection

Integrated Fireworks
fireworks piece
grasping the big picture
Use when data is already available.


[50 KJ method assumes 10 hours].

KJ method
come together of one's own accord
Integrated Fireworks
Putting it all together consciously
The more data you have and the more you can make it speak, the better your fireworks will be.
It comes together within the scope of the person's view.
Help me organize my thoughts.
Overcome the views held by the individual.
New Ideas
An essential view is created.
according to one's ability
Highly creative
Ability to put together a speedy summary
Strong practical skills

Fireworks to think about
The objective is to think about the problem
"Come up with a sales promotion plan for Product A and submit a proposal."
Theme in the middle
expeditionary type
Space placement of what comes to mind.
idea
constraints
Contradictions and conflicts
For example, "Legal issues?" And.
Integrated fireworks when the seed is exhausted
Problems/Issues
Situation Check
Setting the Theme
W-type unisegmented utilization
net work
Fixing labels
Integrated Diagramming
Judgments and Decisions
How to use
Register for illustration
Use of illustrations

theme
leapfrog (over a problem)
Worries and situations are not thought propositions.
What should be considered now for a solution?

W-type unisegmented utilization
Where are we in the W-type problem-solving model?
〜Determine the cause of the ~.
C to D position
〜Develop a strategy for ~.
D to E position
〜List the problems of the ~.
Location of point A

Clarification of the focus of contemplation
The position you are now at in the whole process of one job
Gain perspective on how the work will be carried out before it is implemented.

Some are trying to solve the problem, some aren't.

net work
Spatial placement for each label written.
The first label draws a line from the theme
Place labels on new angles considering their relationship to those already placed
Separate labels from each other by a single clip.
Three principles of spatial arrangement
p.290
in addition
Space arrangement respecting the flow of contemplation
Not arranging space with the intention of putting it all together.
The Great Ethnic Migration should be avoided.
　Exception

walk
Let it out until you feel like your head is empty.
Label everything that pops into your head.
question
anxiety
Mental conflicts are labeled and netted.
　Cognitive therapeutic.
I spit it out anyway, but there are too many labels to get the whole picture.
endpoint
Fixed when you feel like not coming out anymore.
I want to move it.
Evidence that the attitude of trying to put it all together in one's head is starting to move.
Do not move.
Reflects a stream of thought
Do not erase.
Exception
I don't have a heart problem.
No need to preserve the flow of thought
theme
Less need to utilize contradictions and conflicts

Integrated Diagramming
search (for something desired, needed)
The thought that the spatial arrangement may be wrong.
Thoughts are wrong
You must be mistaken.
We are looking at it from the framework of fixed views that we already have.
Fixed net
Listen and search for what speaks to you
however
Some people's net-making work itself is a framework of fixed views.

Fireworks to think about
1000 cases in the past
30-60 sheets on any subject.

[30-60 labels for fireworks to think about].
Time required: 2 to 3 hours
4-5 hours for beginners
Better to use fireworks to think than to worry about it for days.

One piece of data from a different perspective can change the conclusion 180 degrees.
The conclusion is more certain if different perspectives are included.
Become open to differing opinions.
