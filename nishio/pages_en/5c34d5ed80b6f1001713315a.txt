Knowledge Network
He describes it as "a network of knowledge not being formed" with a nuance similar to "knowledge not being built up."
What is this "network of knowledge"?

	[Associative connection]
		Disparate pieces of knowledge are connected by association.
		This is the first step to start connecting [discovering connections] [discovering relationships] [weak connections].
		X and Y have been thought to be unconnected until now, but now realize that they are connected through A.
		Example: I realized that [Hierarchy of Objectives], which I wrote 5 years ago, is related to [OKR] in that it makes Objecive (goals) hierarchical.
	[knowledge integrity].
		The connections made in this way turn into "solid connections" as a number of them overlap each other.
			[Gaining Stability" that can be placed in "Interference Effects of Ideas."
		X and Y are connected through A, through B, and through C
			â†’That's why there is a strong connection between X and Y.
			Example: Both [KJ method], [GTD], and [OKR] commonly support the concept that "higher level concepts are created from the bottom up.
		This [strong connection] creates a network of knowledge.

The locations of X and Y are not fixed; they approach and move away from each other. If the link is connected when they get closer, they can follow the link and move faster when they move away.
