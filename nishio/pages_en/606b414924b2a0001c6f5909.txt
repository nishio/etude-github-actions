I want to avoid making myself old.
As a correlation or average, it is an observed fact that the frequency of old-age behavior increases with age.
Some low-frequency people who are the same age at one step feel, "I've never seen that person act old," while others say, "Everyone I ask agrees that that person is old. I've seen several episodes of problematic behavior," while others have a high frequency of "I've seen several episodes of problematic behavior.
What causes this difference in frequency is of interest, but has not yet been determined. One measure that might trigger the difference is to "familiarize yourself with the old behavior in advance and stop it as early as possible when you are about to do it. If you have said it, apologize immediately, or if you have tweeted it, delete it immediately.
