Quantum chess is life
[Quantum chess] is [life].
 At first, all 20 pieces are equally indeterminate, but the first one to act as a flying car will become a flying car. The one who did not move until the end usually becomes a pawn.
 The player wishes to keep as many [possibilities] as possible, but with each move forward, the number of possibilities decreases rapidly.
 To maximize potential is to do as little as possible. But that strategy will not win.
 If we are proactive without fear of narrowing the possibilities, we can obtain new possibilities (pieces).
 Life indeed.
