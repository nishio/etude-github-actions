(4.1.1.5) Only the content of the book is not a box to build understanding
Only the content of the book is not a [box] to build understanding.

When assembling the information entered from outside, we can use the other information rather than the incoming information. For example, you feel that the explanation in the book fits your experiences. We do not assemble the information written in the book according to the model in the author. (*4) Instead, with the information written in the book, we build a personal model with our personal experience.

When thinking about reading, it tends to consider as [finding information]. In other words, it is just [input]. However, we should not forget the view of [assembling information] to [build understanding]. We combine materials from books and our own experiences.

	Footnote *4: Since we cannot observe the model in the brain of the author, it is impossible to verify whether you made the same model or not.
