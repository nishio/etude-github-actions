You don't have to use your power in front of all people.
Company in the English title would not be a company. It means that you should change your behavior according to who you show it to.
>Adapt Yourself to your Company

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Adapt yourself to your company.
lviii 

You do not have to demonstrate your ability in front of all people. Do not use more power than necessary. Do not make unnecessary expenditures of both knowledge and power. A skillful falconer only flies birds that are useful for tracking. If you show off too much today, you will have nothing to show tomorrow. You must always have something new and dazzling. Showing something fresh every day keeps expectations alive and hides the limits of our abilities.
