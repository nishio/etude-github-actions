>I can say from my experience of moving from N to G that N was by far the [freer] one, including discretion on research topics. I could do MeCab. I was advised (I think) that if I did purely my own research/development, it would be in academia. In other words, it is not a simple matter of "no" because [compensation] is low, but it is necessary to consider the job content, [discretion], and [degree of freedom] as well.
