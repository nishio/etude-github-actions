Three prototypes of function, appearance, and context
[Shuji Hamaguchi]
There are three types of prototypes
	Feature
		[Functional Prototype]
		It can look ugly.
		We just need to show that it works.
		What makes the function experience
	outward appearance
		[Design prototype (aesthetic prototype)
		No need to move.
		Shape and texture, weight, to showcase the UI
	context
		[Contextual Prototypes]
		Promotional videos and faked catalogs
		Product need not be real.
		Conveying a Worldview

Make three in pieces
	cost reduction
	It's easier to get the message across.
	It is important not to mix them halfway.
		Particularly prone to trying to do function and appearance at the same time.
		As you're prototyping a feature, you're thinking, "It looks terrible," or "It could look a little better..." and so on.
		Context and function tend to do the same thing at the same time.
		　When making a slide explaining what the software aims to achieve, what it will be able to do when completed, and how it will make the user happy, I include a "screenshot of what's being done now".
		　I would explain based on "features that can be implemented now."
　　I guess I had not thought of the three types of prototypes separately, so I was drawn to the one that was easiest for me as an engineer to create, the functional prototype.
