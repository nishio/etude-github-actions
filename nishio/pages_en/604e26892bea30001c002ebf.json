ã€€Thoughts.
ã€€ã€€Factorize prime factors and choose prime factors with no overlap
ã€€ã€€There are 72 of them, so 2^72 ways.
ã€€ã€€Inclusion-elimination principle?
ã€€ã€€Considering after-events?
ã€€ã€€[Counting Techniques]
ã€€ã€€If we make a bipartite graph with prime factors and numbers, we can say that what we need to do is to find a bipartite matching
ã€€ã€€ã€€It seems that this is not the way to do it, since it is counting up, rather than seeking the largest one.
ã€€ã€€Bit with or without prime factor [bitDP]?
ã€€ã€€ã€€2^72 is too big.
ã€€ã€€72 is a [special restriction].
ã€€ã€€Since it is a continuous integer, prime factors greater than 73 cannot appear twice.
ã€€ã€€We only need to think about prime numbers less than or equal to 72.
ã€€ã€€20 prime numbers less than or equal to 72, does this work?
ã€€ã€€Official Explanation "This solution is fast enough."
