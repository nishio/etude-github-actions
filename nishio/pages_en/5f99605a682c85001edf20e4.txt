 Thoughts.
 　Given the previous value x, the probability of "succeeding in rolling that dice" is obtained for each dice
 　The smaller the eye, the higher the probability of success, but the lower the success rate of the next dice.
 　Dice are 3 x 10^4, eyes are 1.8 x 10^5, all different
 　Since x can only take the second value, it is sorted and calculated from the largest value.
 　　For largest x, expected value is 0
 　　Can be calculated with DP
 　A naive DP would be to find the one that maximizes the expected value out of all the dice, which is costly and exceeds 10^9.
 　Since all the eyes are different, there is only one dice that changes the "eye and x's size relationship" when x is reduced by one step.
 　　[focus on what will change].
 　　And monotonous increase
  　　Compare the dice with the largest expected value and the updated dice, and take the one with the larger expected value, which can be done in constant order.
 　　This will get you there in time.
	Official Explanation
		The eyes can be sorted and reassigned to sequential numbers since only large and small eyes are used = [coordinate compression].
