 *1322785722* Considerations on understanding
 I'd like to make a note of a Tweet I wrote on November 30, thinking something like "I wonder if there is a methodology for improving productivity in the task of reading and understanding papers that contain mathematical formulas" so that it doesn't drift away.

 Mathematics is a complex and intertwined body of knowledge that places a high burden on the intellect and is therefore a good object of observation when considering what understanding is. The complexity of knowledge cannot be swallowed all at once. It can only be input in fragments. Understanding is the process of taking in fragmented knowledge and then recombining it back into a system of knowledge within oneself.

 Sentences written in natural language have a high frequency of important content. This is not the case in mathematics, however. Expressions are not restated, but simply given an expression number. Frequently used operations are described only for the first time and the rest is omitted. Operations are not described in language in the first place, but only by showing the expressions before and after the operation. The contents are so highly compressed that they cannot be understood unless they are developed first.

 Discovering omitted knowledge, combining within oneself with knowledge presented elsewhere, discovering meta-knowledge from the knowledge presented = acquiring a higher perspective. Meta knowledge is highly applicable to other subjects. Creating highly applicable meta knowledge within oneself, combining and systematizing knowledge within oneself is understood.

 Understanding is a combination of knowledge that happens unexpectedly. It cannot be caused by intention. Therefore, understanding cannot be a TODO. Also, the feeling of having understood is often wrong. Comprehension can only be measured by the quality of output. Therefore, understanding cannot be a goal.
