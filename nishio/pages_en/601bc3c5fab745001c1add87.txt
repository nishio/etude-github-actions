Conversation Log: Design Changes

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]Listen first.
[nisbot.icon]Yes
[nishio.icon]It's not so much that I'm worried about this, it's more like a design change that I'll have to do with this kind of policy, and I'll write it down so that my future self can easily understand it.
[nisbot.icon]"Policy."
[nishio.icon]Now, for each question/keyword pair, the system calculates the score that should be used for it and produces the one with the largest score
[nisbot.icon]"Score"
[nishio.icon]In that case, however, questions that do not take keywords will have a constant score
[nisbot.icon]"Score"
[nishio.icon]So, I am thinking of redesigning the system to calculate the score using the environment as an argument. I will delegate the specific calculation to the question.
[nisbot.icon]"Score"
[nishio.icon]The End
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I thought it would be easier to understand when we look back in the future if we put it into language.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "future" is that "future"?
[nishio.icon]You know how sometimes after a year or so you don't know why you designed the way you did? This change is a bit non-intuitive, so I thought I'd better leave it in writing.

 What "score" is this "score"?
[nishio.icon]Score higher when you decide it is a good idea to ask that question
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Questions that do not take keywords should be able to have a high score depending on the situation. With the current constant score, if you have a high score, it will keep coming up, so it had to be low. It can be improved if it becomes a function that takes environment as an argument.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "question" is that "question"?
[nishio.icon]I am particularly thinking about the feedback this time, "You have few keywords. This is something we should look at the small number of keywords extracted and decide whether to send out or not.
[nisbot.icon]What "keywords" are those "keywords"?
[nishio.icon] This system extracts keywords from the user's input and asks questions in response to them, but if the amount of keywords is small, the conversation is not very lively. Often users fall into such a pattern, so I think it would be good to give them feedback that they should speak in such a way as to increase the number of keywords.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "keyword"?
[nishio.icon]Today, I've tried to extract some that include verbs, but that still doesn't take care of users who make short, low-content statements. I am thinking that it would be better if we gave direct feedback that more words is a good thing.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Score higher when you decide it is a good idea to ask that question.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "score"?
[nishio.icon]As for that specific feedback, I'm thinking that while the keywords extracted are less than 30, the score should be higher as the number of turns progresses. And once they appear, they are consumed.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "score"?
[nishio.icon]The algorithm for score calculation varies from question to question, so I'm thinking of delegating to an object for each question
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "question"?
[nishio.icon]Questions are now object-oriented and made of objects, but reuse using inheritance is not easy to read and the result does not change from instance to instance, so it is better to look up the dictionary by question ID.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know that "question"?
[nishio.icon] Questions are differentiated by question ID.
[nisbot.icon]What do you hope happens with that "question"?
[nishio.icon]Especially questions that don't take keywords, which are currently underutilized, should be more easily utilized.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to that "question"?
I hope [nishio.icon]scores will fluctuate based on the situation.
[nisbot.icon]Can that "score" do it?
[nishio.icon]This new score calculation mechanism can do that.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I'd like to see the score fluctuate based on the situation.
 Where does this "score" come from?
