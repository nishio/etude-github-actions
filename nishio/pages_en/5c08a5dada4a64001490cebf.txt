Trying to determine what cannot be determined.
	It is a mistake to "[meta-judgment]" that "[takes] time" to try to determine what cannot be [determined].
	There are things that cannot be understood by thinking or discussing [beforehand], but can only be understood [after the fact] by doing and [observing the results].
	[Preliminary discussion] = [theoretical speculation].
