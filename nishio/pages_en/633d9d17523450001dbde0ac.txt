Insta ranking update
　If you do "with the data from the last two weeks," the last time the top was at the top again, it's not as interesting as it looks.
　Let's limit it to submissions since the last time we created a ranking.
　When we do this, we're at a disadvantage for submissions near the boundary.

　Some data is missing from the description.

		This is a bug in your submission program...
		It's hard when you don't know the ID, you have to look for it by eye from the picture...
		ID unknown, this is one case, so do you look for it with your eyes?
		There was [/c3cats/20220908015623].
		Done [/c3cats/Instagram Likes Best 30 (2022-09-21~10-05)]

　Why is some descriptive data missing?
