	inverse element
　　[$ A = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n ] 
　　[$ B = 1-x ] 
		At this time [$ A \times B = 1
			[$ A = 1 +  x + x^2 + \ldots ] (1)
			[$ xA =  x + x^2 + \ldots ] (2)
			[$ (1-x)A = 1] (1) - (2)
			Common techniques for calculating sums of sequences of equal ratios
		Generally when F is a formal power series without a constant term such that [$ [x^0]F = 0 ],
			[$ (1-F) \times (\sum_{n=0}^\infty F^n) = 1]
			The proof requires defining a phase in the formal power ring and defining convergence

Count up the number of ways to express N as a sum of positive integers. However, distinguish between different orders of sums.
	[$ F = \sum_{n=1}^\infty x^n],[$ G = \sum_{n=0}^\infty F^n
	[$ [x^n]G ] is the answer
	Replace the infinite sum of G with the inverse original
　	[$ G = \sum_{n=0}^\infty F^n = \frac{1}{1 - F}]	
　The infinite sum of F is also replaced by the inverse element
 	[$ F = \sum_{n=1}^\infty x^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{n+1} = x\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = \frac{x}{1-x}] 
　Substitute F for G
 	[$ G = \frac{1}{1 - F} = \frac{1}{1-\frac{x}{1-x}} = (1-x) \frac{1}{1-2x} ] 
　where the [$ 2x] part is a formal power series, so we can return to infinite sums, which we will call J
	[$ J = \frac{1}{1-2x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (2x)^n] 
	　[$ [x^n]J = 2^n ]
	　From here [$ [x^n] G = [x^n](1-x)J = [x^n]J - [x^{n-1}]J = 2^n - 2^{n-1} = 2^{n-1} ]
