Changing the way people work who don't enjoy their jobs
　For those who enjoy their work, being forced to reduce their work hours is unpleasant
　　Measures to force Fridays off
　　　I wonder if it was thought up by someone who doesn't enjoy his job.
　　　Or reduce the salary to 80% as the working hours are reduced to 80%.
　　　　Positive-looking labor cost reductions
　I want to act on an idea as soon as it occurs to me, even if it's 1 a.m.
　　Labor regulations that prevent them from doing so are a hindrance.
　People who haven't been able to find work they enjoy.
　　If the very presence in the workplace is damaging [basic income], then it might be reasonable to make it [basic income].

People who don't enjoy their work [work style change].
