I want to try different video patterns.
	Physics Board Games
		[Bodoge video].
	Lecture Style (Whiteboard) Video
		Whiteboard, hard to see issue with camera
		Drawing on an iPad and taking a picture of it with a camera -> not so good
		Example of P in P written on iPad: [Guess the last of 13 cards! How to memorize cards]
	Style of using slides
		[YouTuber videos and lightning talks are similar!]
	Video coverage outdoors
	I want to introduce PC games
		ONI, Satisfactory, Factorio...
		How to make it interesting to shoot...
		Does "explaining intent" sound important to you?
