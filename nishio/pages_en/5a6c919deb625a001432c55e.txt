Useful conclusions can be drawn even if they remain untrue.
logic puzzle
 setting a question (for an exam)
 	There are two types of islands: Tribe A, which always says the right thing, and Tribe B, which always lies.
  There are three natives; when I asked the first one his race, he answered in the local language, so I didn't know.
  I asked the second, "What did he say?" I replied, "He said he was Tribe B." The third person countered, "No, no, he said he was Tribe A."
  Who is lying, the second or the third?
 answer
  The excellent part of this puzzle is asking who is lying, the second or the third person.
  It is not possible to determine if the first person is lying.
  If the first person is Tribe A, they honestly say they are Tribe A. If they are Tribe B, they lie and say they are Tribe A.
  So there is no way to answer, "It's Tribe B."
  From this we know that the second person is lying.

Is an irrational power of an irrational number ever a rational number?
	Consider the numbers [$ x = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}, y=x^{\sqrt{2}}=(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2
 Drawing useful conclusions without specifying whether x is a rational or irrational number
 If x is a rational number, this is an example of "an irrational number whose irrational power is rational"
 If x is an irrational number, then y is an example of "an irrational number whose irrational power is a rational number"
 Therefore, we can say "there are rational numbers for which the irrational power of an irrational number is a rational number".
