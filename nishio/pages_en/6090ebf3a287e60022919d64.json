 What day is it today?
 
 It was a physical education day.
 
 *1191809557* Hey, yoshiori!
 
 I really thought I was going to make a proxy that would add "in a sexual way" to adjectives in id:jYoshiori's statements at an appropriate rate.

 I have absolutely no idea why they would say this.
 At best, I've gone around putting "(sexually)" in every word of java-ja.

 Oh, I see, they are both daring me to be erotic in order to distract me from their own eroticism! It must be so!
 
 *1191823148* Leverage memo
 
 Maintenance has become a hassle and has been neglected for quite some time.

 I thought it was a Sunday story, so I used it as normal.
 
 
 *1191835099* I don't do meta work, so I'm busy working.
 
 I found myself somewhat psychologically trapped and stopped checking even my mid-term schedule.
 I despaired of myself, who came to work unaware that it was a holiday, or that I couldn't even decide whether it was tomorrow or the day after tomorrow when I saw that my regular periodical was until October 18, or even further!

 *1191854345* from cell phone. Tennis
 
 I was on a losing streak, but halfway through the game I woke up to something and beat the top pro without giving him a single game. My score is now 1600, and I need to get to 2000 to beat a flesh-and-blood player, so all I need to do now is to be able to fight consistently.
