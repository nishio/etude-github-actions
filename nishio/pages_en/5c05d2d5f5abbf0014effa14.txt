seed generator
I have a feeling that having people who produce technological [seeds] pursue economic [innovation] will reduce their satisfaction. Just as having a competent researcher manage an organization does not always work. Another skill set.

Not merely different, but perhaps the opposite. While it is necessary to go one's own way without being distracted by what others think and to have "[an] inherent axis of evaluation" in order to be able to continue one's own line of research, on the other hand, for economic innovation, it is necessary to "let go of one's [ To "abandon the evaluation axis that is inherent in you" is necessary for economic innovation. Some people can do both of these things, but it takes a lot of mental toughness.

It might be better to apply a term that is not "[innovator]" to the type of person who has an inherent axis of evaluation and continues to research original lines and generate new technological seeds to organize his/her thinking. I wonder if he is a seed generator because he is a person who creates seeds.
