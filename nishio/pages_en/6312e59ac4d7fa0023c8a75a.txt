If you don't read the errors, you're lost.

Read the error message and you can fix it right away.

I don't even notice that the error message changes along the way, I just think "it's an error all the way through" and I'm trying to figure it out.
ã€€It's even worse when they keep piling fixes on top of fixes.

I don't know what kind of answer you were expecting.
>I think in this vein I would go with "get into the habit of reading first" instead of "why".

Did you read the error? I'm not sure why he would say "Did you read the error? I thought he had read it, so I asked him "What kind of error? and if the answer is "I didn't read it...", it could be "Why? In that case, "I'll read it" would be "No, I'm not asking you that, I'm asking you why.
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1565854391105892354 @nishio]: I still think my case is "Error what?" I don't think it's a "why" to "I didn't read it", it's more like "read it then". I don't think the reason why the person didn't read the error at this time will help me to investigate the problem. I think that asking "why" at this time may have an intention other than error correction.

>I have a feeling this will happen.
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1565857825959874560 @nishio]: "I was trying to figure things out without reading the error message, and I lost my way. I can't go back because I didn't back up the source code.
>I knew it wouldn't be "why don't you read the errors" or "why don't you make backups".
