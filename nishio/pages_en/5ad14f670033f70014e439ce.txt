glycine
Experimenting and observing with my own body

	Observation Diary 1
 	Day 1: Wake up at 7:00 a.m. to attend a lecture at 9:00 a.m.
  Worked until 27:00 (3:00) to prepare materials for the next day's presentation.
  Afterwards, 9 g of glycine was administered and bedtime
  Day 2: Wake up 4.5 hours later (7:30) without alarm
  Work continued from morning without sleepiness
   >I still doubt that glycine is a sleep compressing effect. If I'm going to sleep early tonight, I've simply postponed sleep. If I can run another 20 hours today, I have succeeded in compression.
			Considered the possibility of stress caused by having work near a deadline.
		I was going to see what time I could stay up and work on it, but around 11pm
  >Now I'm so low in intelligence that I can't decide if it's normal or better than normal to be low in intelligence when I've been up for 20 hours, slept for 4.5 hours, and stood up for 15.5 hours. I am not sleepy, but I am not smart.
		23:00 Bedtime without taking glycine.
  Day 3: Wake up after 7.5 hours (6:30 am) without alarm
  consideration
  	Under normal circumstances, I get up at 7:30am, do my normal work, and I'm not often out of action at 23:00pm.
   	Except when you do very brain-intensive work.
   There was some fatigue in the afternoon, but much less than "if you skip breakfast and eat a bowl of katsudon for lunch".
   	Oh, I didn't have lunch this time, so it's possible that the lack of lunch is not good for me to feel sluggish after dinner.
				However, I bathe 45 minutes after dinner, which is different from the common "sleepy after dinner" symptom
			So "taking 9g of glycine and sleeping for 4.5 hours" does not reset the previous day's fatigue
			They just hold off on debt payments until the night.
   What are the liabilities?
    Possibility that the "debt" metaphor is misleading.
   Is it reset by sleeping 7.5 hours the next night?
