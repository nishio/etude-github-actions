	Two-SAT can be solved by using [strongly connected component decomposition] [2-SAT].
	Two-SAT is a problem to find the solution of a logical equation in the form of an OR of two terms connected by an AND.
	　But in the case of problem H, it would be easier to understand to construct the graph directly using that principle than to use Two-SAT.
	Principle of attributing Two-SAT to strongly connected component decomposition
	　If A, then B. The relationship can be thought of as an edge in a directed graph.
	　Considering the strongly connected components of this graph, if any one of them is True, then all of them are True, so they are either all True or all False
	　[https://gyazo.com/8226413287676381d2b6bd90036798ef]
	　OR can be converted to "if" by [$ (A \vee B) = (\neg A \Rightarrow B) \wedge (\neg B \Rightarrow A)
　　So if we construct a graph, perform a strongly connected component decomposition, and assign a boolean value to each component, we can obtain a solution
　　　If A and not A are in the same component, it is unsatisfiable, if they are different components, we can say True when A is first.
　　　　I can't properly show that this allocation will not cause problems. I don't think the general graph is good enough.
　Returning to the specific problem H, we can construct a graph with the "if" in "If a flag is placed at Xi, then a flag must not be placed at a distance less than D" as an edge and decompose it into strongly connected components
