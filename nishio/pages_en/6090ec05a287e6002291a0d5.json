 *1278419692*Addition regarding Haskell Quiz
 <a href='http://blog.hackers-cafe.net/2010/06/haskell-quiz.html'>Hacker's Cafe Blog: Haskell Quiz</a>
 
 I didn't write that ($) is not redefined, plainly and inadvertently.... I kind of wish I hadn't said "uniquely determined". It's too common for me to make careless mistakes like this that cause extra stuffing.
 
 I don't think the first half of the quiz is a dummy, and I don't want to quiz you if you can do anything in the language that can redefine operators like that.
 
 Also, I think it's a pretty great insight in general that id:n_shuyo commented to me when I asked him about this issue, "It seems like it would be easy to make it in PHP or something" Why is it so easy to cause "mathematically speaking weird behavior" in PHP, Perl or JavaScript?
 >|javascript|
 // JS
 a = "9"
 b = 10
 c = "100"
 console.log(a < b) // true
 console.log(b < c) // true
 console.log(c < a) // true
 ||<
 It is because programming languages do all sorts of extra things other than mathematical behavior. It is because the programming language does a lot of extra things other than mathematical behavior, and it does it because it thinks it is more convenient to do so. In this case, it's "convert a string to a number on its own when you compare it to a number. Well, I guess there are more cases where it is actually useful, but if you use a useful tool without understanding it deeply, it will bite you in the hand in complicated cases. I sometimes think I'm quizzing you by making such complex cases. In other words, if I think about what is the PHP-like part of Haskell, I wonder if I can get a hint.
 
 *1278429353*Make Google Gadget.
 Making a gadget that I had neglected for about two years, thinking I would make it when I felt like it.
 It was not so difficult because I only had to write a little bit of XML,
 
 The,
 
 I don't know how to clear the wrong XML that has been cached! So...
 >|python|
 Rule('/gg/def<dummy>', endpoint='google_gadget_definition'), 
 ||<
 I decided to change the URL freely and rename it if I wanted to clear the cache!

 Yeah, yeah, I got it. There's some kind of white border, but that's not essential, so I'll just do it another time when I'm ready.
