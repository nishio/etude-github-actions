Can/can't is a false dichotomy
[Can]/[cannot] is a [false dichotomy].

	I can do it, [I can do it but it's exhausting], I can't do it.
	Can be done, can be done but very time consuming, can't be done
 	"[Impossible] means it will cost extra [money] than other [options]."
 Known what can be done, known what cannot be done, unknown if it can be done
