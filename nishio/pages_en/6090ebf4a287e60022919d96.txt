 Let's assume that I didn't see that the site is made by PHP (XOOPS), but why nobody said "Why don't you change the favicon? XOOPS on Rails?

 I guess this is it.

 Blender is a software application for... Blender is a 3D modeling, rendering, and animation tool. By using Python scripts and other tools... The source code is released as open source under the GPL, and Blender itself is distributed as freeware.

 And I can output with COLLADA.

 It can be loaded in PaperVision3D.

 I'll give it a try one of these days.

 Blender's "unintuitiveness" was not half-baked.
 I tried to fiddle with it anyway without looking at the documentation, but I couldn't even figure out how to rotate the screen.

 Let's separate the classes for lambda.

 I got angry with actionscript-mode.el saying Symbol's function definition is void: c-identifier-re. cc-mode is required.
 
 *1196334522*Order of method resolution for multiple inheritance
 id:amachang asked me, "In Perl, MRO (Method Resolution Order) can be selected by an external library such as width-first search or C3. I was asked, "What about Python?
 
 In the new class
 
 >|python|
 >>> class A(object):
 	pass
 
 >>> class B(object):
 	pass
 
 >>> class AB(A, B):
 	pass
 
 >>> class BA(B, A):
 	pass
 
 >>> class ABBA(AB, BA):
 	pass
 
 
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<pyshell#14>", line 1, in <module>
     class ABBA(AB, BA):
 TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
     Cannot create a consistent method resolution

 C3 linearization - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

 Is it?
 
 Doing the same thing with the old class does not result in an error. I'm not really aware of it, but I guess a lot of things are different.

 Yes, many people (myself included) seem to understand that "search for the grandfather class after all parent classes have been explored", but that is wrong.
 
 >|python|
 >>> class C(object):
 	def foo(self):
 		return "C"
 
 	
 >>> class A(object):
 	def foo(self):
 		return "A"
 
 >>> class B1(A):
 	pass
 
 >>> class B2(A):
 	pass
 
 >>> class D(B1, B2, C):
 	pass
 
 >>> D().foo()
 'A'

 *1196348472* "x == x + 1" solution
 Previously:
 
 In Python, you can make an x like this with four letters."
 
 Synopsis of this issue:
 
 I mean, you can make a four-letter word in most languages.
 
 First, JavaScript. with Firebug.
 >|javascript|
 >>> var x = 1e16;
 >>> x == x + 1;
 true
 ||<
 
 Next Ruby. irb:
 
 >|ruby|
 irb(main):001:0> x = 1e16
 => 1.0e+016
 irb(main):002:0> x == x + 1
 => true
 ||<
 
 Perl：
 >|perl|
 >perl -e "$x = 1e16; print $x == $x + 1;"
 1
 ||<
 
 PHP:
 >|php|
 >php -r "$x = 1e16; print ($x == $x + 1);"
 1
 ||<
 
 Haskell:
 >|haskell|
 Prelude> 1e16 == 1e16 + 1
 True
 ||<
 
 Scheme:
 >|scheme|
 > (= (+ 1e16 1) 1e16)
 #t
 ||<
 
 Emacs Lisp:
 
 >|elisp|
 (= (+ 1e16 1) 1e16) ;-> t
 ||<
 
 R:
 >|r|
 > 1e16 == 1e16 + 1
 [1] TRUE
 ||<
 
 The train arrived at the station, so this is the end. I've been looking for a processing system in my laptop rather than programming, but the bottom line is that in many languages, 1e16 is x that satisfies x == x + 1.
