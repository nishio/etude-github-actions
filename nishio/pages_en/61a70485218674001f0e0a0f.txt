I want to be a man of the box, not a man with split fingers.

I was thinking about self-display in VR space.
　I don't have a strong desire to be something other than humanoid, so I use humanoid avatars for the masses, but I don't have much desire to be humanoid, so if I had to make a full scratch avatar, I wouldn't choose a humanoid one.
　　Because the masses are unnecessarily discerning about humanoid objects, they are expensive.
　I was thinking about it, and then I got to the guy in the box.
　　However, the person in the box also slipped and fell into the sea in the play, which is not good.
　In the first place, physical localization is an old generation idea.
　　Isn't it not good enough to go to the trouble of mimicking the localization that is characteristic of matter in a world without physical constraints?
