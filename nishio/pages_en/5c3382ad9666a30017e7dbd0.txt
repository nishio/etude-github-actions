Writing a book is writing a book.
>When you have written a book on a subject, you can write a book on that subject.

	[It's like the chicken and the egg.
	By making your own notes on a subject, you will be able to talk about it with others,
	By talking to others, I am able to understand what is difficult to understand and write easy-to-understand explanations,
	Writing a clear commentary will allow you to place it in a larger context
	And by situating it within a larger context, it is possible to write books whose content is arranged according to the larger context,
	By writing such books, one can instantly determine whether the world's discourse is "written" or "fits but does not fit" or "does not fit".
	Then, while "defending" by collecting what is not written that fits, we know "where to break" based on the information that doesn't fit. And after about 5 years, a new book is born #defend-break
