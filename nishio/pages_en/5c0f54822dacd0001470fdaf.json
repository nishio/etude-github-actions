gas mantle
	A mesh-like object, generally made of thorium oxide, used to cover flames in lanterns, etc.
	[Thorium's low infrared emissivity and high visible light emissivity make it useful in radiating flame energy as light rather than heat.

	>In 1890, thorium was found to be superior to magnesium, and in 1891, he perfected a combination of 99 percent thorium oxide and 1 percent cerium oxide that produced a much whiter light and a stronger mantle. The gas mantle played a major role in street lighting until the widespread use of electric lights in the early 1900s.
