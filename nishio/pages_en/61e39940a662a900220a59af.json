Be prepared to set a price
>tshun423 https://twitter.com/tshun423/status/1482291805047894020]: I heard [Kazuo Inamori] said, "[Pricing] is management," but lately I often think "[Pricing] is [preparedness]". A price is a determination to say, "I will give this much value for this job. If you set a price, you must be able to return more than that value, and if you don't think you can deliver that value, then you shouldn't accept that price in the first place.

[Are you unprepared to offer free of charge?"]
