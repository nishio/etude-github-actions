Collaborative editing projects on Scrapbox
I've seen some interesting examples of collaborative editing projects on Scrapbox, and I'd like to make this happen elsewhere... but I'm still a little unsure of "what to do to make it work"...

	Participated in 2021-04-29 [/blu3mo-public/202103~ Scrapbox limited public operation
	2021-05-16~ [Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference] was run by the [Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference].
　Unexplored Junior creators begin to create personal projects.
　　(I guess I'm still uncomfortable with shared places.)
　　Several people are copying blu3mo's approach and making it a co-edit.
　[The 54th Meeting of Young Scientists in Information Science].
　　I decided to use the same [inverted presentation style] as the Unexplored Junior's Boost Conference regarding my own invited performances.
　　I'd like to see a network of self-introductions among the event participants, but I'm not sure how much I can facilitate from my position as an outsider.
　2021-07-18 I've discovered a trick for a collaborative editing project that's working well and I'm tempted to roll it out horizontally.

　　　Okay, this looks good.
　　　　There is a problem that if you write "welcome" in text in chat, the log will flow every time someone enters.
　　　　A "welcome emoji" is sometimes used instead.

　　　　　In this case, some people might feel like they're getting a silent stare back from 14 people in response to a greeting from a newcomer.
　　　　Scrapbox is good because it's human language, but not bulky with multiple people by stacking icons.
　　　And it's a great way to get an early experience of Scrapbox's unique feature, which is that other people may write on your introductory page.
