 *1418626623*Problem with VirtualBox not being able to access shared folders -> resolved
 The host is Windows, the guest is Ubuntu, and it is convenient to share folders and auto-mount them with just a little configuration in the VirtualBox settings dialog! But when I tried to access the files in the folder, I was told that I didn't have the permission to access the folder.
 
 By default, the shared folders are 660 with owner root and group vboxsf. So user nishio cannot access it. So we add nishio to the vboxsf group.

 $ sudo adduser nishio vboxsf

 Do I need to re-login for it to take effect? I rebooted for another issue and was able to access the site successfully.
 
 *1418628439* Port forwarding is easy to SSH to Ubuntu in VirtualBox.
 The host is Windows, the guest is Ubuntu, and I can't connect to the host by using ifconfig to check the IP address and ssh as usual. Is it because the default network setting is NAT?
 
 Go to Settings -> Network -> Port Forwarding and forward port 3022 on the host to port 22 on the guest. Then SSH to 3022 on the host to connect to the guest.

 ssh -p 3022 nishio@lovalhost
