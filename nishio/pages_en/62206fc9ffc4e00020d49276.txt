from [/unnamedcamp/what is Unnamed Camp].
Instead of creating a page with a proper noun in the title first, we will only write a bean paper and then proceed to link to the keywords contained within the page as an adjunct.
　[/unnamedcamp/ikkitime.icon]I can't quite visualize it, but that's one way to use Scrapbox, isn't it?
　[/unnamedcamp/rashita.icon] In other words, you can imagine wikipedia. There, "sentence" is never the title (although I have not scrutinized all of them).
　[/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon] Am I correct in understanding that "instead of deciding on the page title first, write a chunk of text and then use the important phrases in it as the title"?
　　[write a sentence, then title it].
