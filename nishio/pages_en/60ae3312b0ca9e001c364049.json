Smartness does not correlate with rationality.
>IQ [smartness] has little correlation with the ability to make rational decisions, and in fact, the smarter a person is, the more likely he or she is to fall into the "intelligence trap" of disastrous irrationality in order to better gather evidence to justify himself or herself. I thought this was a very important lesson: smartness is not the same as the ability to make the right decision.
>I know it's just an image, but "[smartness]" is instantaneous and fast thinking with arithmetic processing power. On the other hand, "[rationality]" is slow thinking that looks at a single thing from various directions, without bias, and with a high level of imagination. In this light, it is not surprising that the two do not correlate. Fortunately, the latter ability can be acquired with training.
