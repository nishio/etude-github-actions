Estimated playing time (Nishio's personal experience) (The first time I wrote this, I kept it simple, but it gradually grew longer and longer.)
　Fly into space on the first day (Saturday)
　2nd day
　　Interplanetary resource transport using transport ships begins in the evening [interplanetary transport].
　　Use those resources to advance your research and complete what you can research up to the yellow cube in Tier 3.
　　　My inventory is now about 100 squares.
　　Next we need a lot of silicon to make purple cubes
　　I thought I didn't need to transport silicone because of the stones, but now I pretty much need silicone here.
　　The amount we were collecting on Earth was no longer enough.

	[Dyson Sphere Program Day3]
　　Do one hand-held transport of silicone.
		Interplanetary transport of silicon
　　Attach power plant to unused oil wells.
　　　This work can be done in parallel with making the purple cubes at hand.
　　500 purple cubes
　　Gas giant use, I'll finally be able to do it today.

	Next
　　Automated cube creation?
　　　Handmade 1000 purple cubes most recently, and green cubes will be released soon!
　　　Check how much is needed for the entire rest of the study, and if it's faster to make it by hand while you're designing the automated plant, it won't matter.
　Day 4
　　Green cube released.
　　1000 purple cubes made for green cube liberation.
　　And I've counted, and it looks like I need to make at least 8,000 more green and purple pieces each.

			>More than one of my friends continues to build Dyson spheres as if they were obsessed, and their pace is so phenomenal, but it is indeed worrisome to see even those with decent jobs playing at a pace of 10+ hours a day, unlike me and my NEAT muscle.
			I started at 8pm and went to bed at 26pm, so that's 6 hours!
			I'm looking back at 29:30 and saying "oh, I worked in a factory for 9 hours" [src https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1352714913928540161]!
			However, I started at 8pm and by the time the green plant was ready, it was around midnight, so I feel like it's not good for me to sit still during that time.
　5th day
　　More spaceports and graphene
		[Bottleneck elimination].
 	By the way, maybe it's because I don't expand the factory much, but there is no power shortage, and there is little incentive to make the all-important Dyson sphere.
 		I guess I'll just go sightseeing in other solar systems for now.
 	It's time to start depleting the ore we've been digging for since the beginning.
 	At first, I took off for a star three light years away (I should have saved my life).
   That's about 0.01 light-years in 10 seconds, which means it would take about 40 minutes to arrive.
   Let's go home for today, I guess I need to do some research on the warp.
		[Ray receivers and ejectors]
　Day 6
　　Solar sails are broken over time, so we will accumulate them and launch them all at once, once the ejector is removed
　　What and how much does it take to make a Dyson sphere?
　　I built a vertical launch silo, this looks like it will deliver a small rocket to the Dyson sphere.
　　Dual hydrogen cartridges are needed for the rocket.
　　At any rate, now that warp is possible, let's go sightseeing again.
　　I locked the destination and then warped past it!
　　　I'm back to saved data.
　　And while we're at it, let's take it to the spaceport.
　　This time I went out of warp too soon... void...
   Forgot to save... sadness...
   We had to fly normally for 10 minutes.
   Don't forget to save before you fly off on your interstellar trip...
  Neighboring star system, sad because there was only one planet, but happy because there was 25M of copper, oceans are lava
  Return Warp
  　It had plenty of fuel, but its lack of burn rate prevented it from changing direction to land on the target planet after reaching the target solar system...

		[https://gyazo.com/93e9b07d3833dda1b901b3cbd0c8075b]
　Began distribution of copper sheets by transport ship.
　　Isn't it funny that the starmap says it takes 33s to get there, when the next planet is 37s?
　　I left it there while you bathed and you didn't get it.
　About 4,000 green cubes had accumulated.
　　I didn't leave it up at night, but if I had, it would have gone 10,000 by the end of the week with plenty of time to spare.
　　Green is at 7.4/m, rather than purple, which is down to 5.4/m.
 Day 7
 　The problem of interstellar transporters taking too long is that the transporters also need to use warp items
 　　Do we use 2 warp items to get there and back? 200 copper for 2 warp items? hmmm...
 　[Dyson Sphere Program @ 2021-01-28｜ossan｜note https://note.com/osama/n/n366bb825b4de]
 　>Once the yellow research can be produced, all subsequent power generation can be left to the Dyson worm.
 　Dyson swarms break down over time, so it's a finite resource consumption, is that ok? My planet is so low in copper that I'm worried about depletion.
   If you need 1 copper for a solar sail and launch 320 per minute, there are only 800K on the earth, so it will all be gone in 40 hours.
   I have a theory that my solar system has a bad copper pull.
   >800K is pretty tight. We're launching on a planet with 1.8M iron, 3M copper and 12M stone, not touching any of the materials in the home country.
   I like it... >3M on a single planet... We only have 2M even if we rake the entire solar system...
	  Well, one could think that making a Dyson worm is no big deal if depletion is 80 hours away.
	　　Solar sails were made in a box of chests, 6,000 of them.
  It is interesting that each person has a different resource supply and demand in their own solar system. I, on the other hand, am envious that there's a FireIce-producing gas giant next to my early planets, and that graphene is plentiful.
   Graphene is plentiful -> oil used to create graphene is scarce -> burn it to generate thermal power -> postpone Dyson Swarm?
		There's a mystery resource out there.
			[https://gyazo.com/ae7b0467b9824d17439fa28725cc7f6c]
		At any rate, I thought it would be tricky to get the double deuterium needed for the carrier rocket, so I started developing oil fields to produce double deuterium.
			Four cases quickly accumulated.
			It's tricky to get the quantum chip needed, and to take it away from the green cube creation lane.
			I wonder if they will reduce the amount of cubes they make and turn them into rockets after the research is complete.
			　No, that's not going to happen because we'll use all the other cubes for the white cube as the last mission, so we'll have to create a new line.
		The research proceeded to Ionosphere use, the green cubes are less than a case, so they are carried once by hand.
		The main unit update seems to have fixed the problem of warp not stopping that plagued us yesterday.
			If warp becomes more comfortable, I don't want to fail and have to fly for 10 minutes in the void, so "warp with an inventory full of copper" emerges as a realistic option.
			I have 100 squares of inventory now, so if I carry it as fast as I can, I can carry 10,000 in two warps.
		I've only used the splitter for splitting purposes, but I didn't know it could change shape and filter.
			Tab key changes shape and belts out from the second floor.

		　hard to understand
		　Petrochemical plants have become so much easier.
		　Separation of hydrogen from produced oil or charcoal is now easier.
 		　I've been doing this for a while now.
 　[https://gyazo.com/fe0e733c531da476dcd04b980b1d4aa6]
		　And, if you use a splitter that changes height, it's easy to branch out and pull it out.
		They say wireless power towers can feed power to players.
			Sometimes the axis is chattering because it was feeding power to the player.

　　　I was working on it and Vessel came in at just the right angle of view, so I took the shot.
　　The study went to Universe Matrix after Dirac was finished.
   [https://gyazo.com/1f1fe9c482e2c8f696801bde834701ac]
   [https://gyazo.com/c2cec50fe3f2560ee7a38d1ed28c64ca]
　We used a few rockets, so let's launch them.
　Did I make a launch silo? I went to get titanium alloy to make one, but it was on the way (dangerous).
　Dyson shell, I can choose layers, but why is the default so big? Wouldn't it be better to make it smaller?
　[https://gyazo.com/a3265547d38b0e221cf3263b969648ca]

  [https://gyazo.com/2052bd551a656247aa8d10d5d3a0c65f]
　The surrounding stars are interesting, but I'm not sure how to warp the transport ship, and because the transport ship was so far away, it wasn't carrying FireIce from nearby Jupiter and stopped at the green cube.
	  I don't know how long it took, but it looks like they brought 200 copper from 3 light years away lol.
	  Warp the transports: transport drone upgrade; at level 4, a slot is created in the spaceport so that the transports can grab two warp items at a time and fly away
	  I hope they don't fly away when they don't have warp items, I heard it's on the roadmap until 2/11 so expect it to be implemented in the future.
		Dyson shells, you can choose the layers, but is there any reason not to make the smallest one, other than it looks cool?
			I've launched six rockets, but I've only been able to make two that look like cuy, and that's a mystery.
　Day 8
　　Oh, right, the neighboring planet that only mined ore because there was no oil production, now we can make graphene with FireIce, so we can build a factory.
　　There's a shortage of quantum chips being created on Earth, so why not do it here?
　　Ah, chemcrystals and titan glass demanding water...
　　It's rather easier to create a gravity lens...
　　And making rockets with quantum chips...
　　And you need sulfuric acid to make titanium alloys...
　　Maybe best to carry the water in a vessel...
　　[https://gyazo.com/668e83400a5313d72c8ae1200102c0f2]
　　　I can now warp.
　　I realized after I carried the water, I needed to carry the oil as well, or the chem crystals...
　　　If you're going to carry it, it's oil.
　　In the meantime, I'll make a turbine and processor and put them in a box.
　　Carry Oil, Carry FireIce, Quantum Chip Automation is complete.
　　　But since we're getting 2:2 hydrogen and graphene from FireIce and using 12:2, we're going to have a tremendous surplus of graphene.
　　　The box to store the graphene will run out of capacity and stop sooner or later... burn it?
　　　Either we need to bring the graphene to Earth, or we need to bring the hydrogen we take from the oil wells on Earth and burn it here, but either way the slots at the spaceport are full, so we need to build new ones.
　　　The system was designed to release hydrogen from the spaceport and put away graphene. What to do when the graphene is full has not yet been decided.
　　Now that we have automated production of quantum chips, we can build rockets.
　　　Not enough deuterium...
　　　Titanium alloys, too.
　　　It will be more like a collection of pieces being made here and there.
　　　I set up a line that I would collect them and leave them there, and then I would make them and launch them.
　　It's done.
　　　[https://gyazo.com/ce90227bb0c943bc4623cb45239f767b]
　　　I thought I didn't quite understand how to make a sphere, but in the unresearched stage of the stress system, you can only go up and down from the orbit to 0 degrees, so you can only make a ring.
　　　After one level of research, I can finally plan the surface.

[https://gyazo.com/e2c92abff7958feba25328c9e0799946]
[https://gyazo.com/ae29bd5e62e11733ac8477d120ec8eba]
You plan a surface and it starts sucking in solar sails.

[https://gyazo.com/804b8bbe8b6bd191cb232139cc13e67c]
Oh, I see, so this is how the surface is formed.

[https://gyazo.com/42b9c626df16771e76f185b0b950f929]
In the meantime, we have plenty of power to spare, so we'll accumulate photons.

[https://gyazo.com/cedab91b1ae6fdd25bd0732d075aaf93]

I'm finding a sea of sulfuric acid, I like it.

Day 9
[https://gyazo.com/af40fe6b8fd1d9c20f135f920897cfa3]
I'm actually getting a little bored.
I've already studied the white cube.
Iron and copper mines had dried up and lines had stopped.
Copper is about to run low on the planet.
I made sure to ship on the next planet.

We decided to burn the excess graphene. It has little value as a fuel, so the surplus will disappear as soon as it goes to a thermal power plant.
----


Sail Mode
	I can't seem to find the rocket in the tech tree I was wondering how it would get to the other planets, but I missed the upgrade tab.
	I started out as a sort of satellite of Jupiter, but then I suddenly jumped into space and fell into Jupiter in a hurry and ran out of gas and got stuck there lol.

Day 2 4:41 PM nishio Yay, interplanetary shipping has begun!
	Finally I can reach titanium without hand held transport, I want to call the game clear here lol.
	I think it should be clear once you are out in space for the first time lol.
	That's the perfect size for working people to play on weekends lol.

Interplanetary Transport
	Q: I put the logistic station on two planets, one as supply and the other as demand, I don't know which one to put it in, so I put the drone in both, but it doesn't fly, what am I missing?
	 Do I have to fill up the tower?
	 Wow, I misunderstood, you had to put up interstellar instead of intraplanetary, I thought the latter was interstellar.
  I think I can do the research with the yellow cubes I have on hand.
  Oh, and it looks like I need to build a vessel, not a drone.
	If you do the next research on the drone transport stuff, you'll be able to do interplanetary transport, and what you use for that is not a drone, but a much larger ship.
	Upgrade the spaceport-like structure to a larger one.
	And I think you'd need a titanium alloy for that, so you'd have to transport it hand-held once or twice.

vessel
	Yay, interplanetary shipping has begun, only 200 on one vessel...
	Vessel found that it could be added to either port.
	It would be good if we could create and add vessels at the home base.
	Maybe the mysterious "arrival in minutes" that appears on the solar system display is how long it takes to transport.
	I'm sure it is.
	Oh, you can see the location of the ship on the solar system map.

6:58 PM nishio I can now make purple cubes... but I have a long way to go

Q: What is a good way to waste hydrogen?
	burn
 Burn more and more because it tends to clog up with excess refined oil and excess hydrogen.
 I've got enough in one tank stashed away in case I suddenly need it, but I've never needed it...
 They're ramping up thermal generation and burning everything they don't need.
 　PS: No point in wading in.
 　　Excess fuel due to low combustion rate at low load
 　　The conveyor belt was clogged, stopping upstream refineries and other plants, so they extended the conveyor belt longer and increased the number of thermal power plants, but this is not an appropriate solution.
 　　When load increases, upstream power plants take fuel at high speed, so fuel can't reach downstream.
 　　Better to buffer the surplus in front of the power plant to liquid tanks or warehouses.
 　　　Separate it by type and you can fit a lot in it.
 　　　Hydrogen and refined oil to tanks, charcoal to stacked warehouses
 　　　Liquid tanks can also be stacked.
 　　　If a conveyor belt is adjacent to the warehouse's two sides and brought in by six sorters, there will be no spillage, and the rest will be poured into liquid tanks.

filter (esp. camera)
　When extending a sorter from a belt where things are mixed, a filter can be set in the TAB.
　You can set the filter after installation, but the time lag between setting it and sending the extra

space flight
	I can use TAB to turn on/off the cursor sync, so I'll be in sync mode and have the star I want in front of me, then press forward to align it, then TAB to desync and watch the craft screen and stuff until I get there.

oil well
	2.31 oil wells per second, produced with 5-6 refineries, then cracked with 11-12 refineries, all able to hydrogen and briquettes
	 2 crude oil is processed in 4 seconds, so 2.31 x 4 ÷ 2
	I tried to burn it all with thermal power, but it seems to burn slowly when the load is low, so I concluded that the appropriate number of thermal power plants cannot be found out even if I line up the number of thermal power plants. It seems that we can adapt to changes in supply and demand by storing hydrogen in liquid tanks without having to build storage batteries.
	The cracking plant is out, in, and in in three horizontal squares, with oil in from the short side. This way, once the hydrogen is in, the self-produced hydrogen is recovered, so all that needs to be in from the outside is the oil.

Q: How do you make deuterium from hydrogen?
	You can either pass hydrogen through a device that has a low probability of becoming deuterium, or, as the technology advances, you can make it stable in an accelerator.
	I left the excess hydrogen in the former through the loop and I've accumulated a box, but what's the use...
 It looks like we can generate fusion power if we process it in various ways, but to be honest, it's a hassle, so I'm thinking of increasing thermal power generation...
 But as time goes on, power may be so tight that we may be forced to do it. Maybe this game is designed to inflate the demand for power?
 My next play is to install the power plant I tried yesterday on all the oil wells on the planet for now.

Q: How do you get hydrogen from Jupiter?
	It looks like we can finally use gas giants in the next study of interplanetary transport.
	We've studied it, but we're not trying to get it from Jupiter because we're burning excess hydrogen.
	　Do you get it and burn it to pay for it?
	　You've got to develop the undeveloped oil wells on the ground first.
	In the meantime, we set up a collection device.

conveyor belt crossing
	I didn't notice, the menu was coming out the side.

Is there any way to lighten the night?
	The day on the second planet was so long, I couldn't see anything during the night... wind power wasn't great, solar stopped after a long night, coal was a little far away, it was like hell.
	The update made myself glow.

Beware of fuel depletion
　Landing on Jupiter without fuel, unable to fly away, and starting over from saved data.
　I landed on Neptune with an empty inventory to do a hand-held transport of titanium, but it was behind the point where I could refuel, and when I tried to fly, I ran out of fuel and could only walk at rest.

Q: How do you collect gas from a gas planet? I've been to Jupiter and couldn't set it up.
	A: The tiny text says "only at the equator."
	I also said, "What? I can't put it down?" I was like, "What?
