 The battery is still dead because both the charger and the cable for USB charging are missing...
 
 *1210328733*Tahoiya
 I was researching the Google Web API and found <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/gglwebapi/index.html">Let's play with Google Web APIs</a> via <a href="http://ja. wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%9F%E3%81%BB%E3%81%84%E3%82%84">Tahoiya - Wikipedia</a>
 
 I'd like to try the Taihoi game.
 
 *1210352329*A holiday already?
 I've only been working for three days, so I'm overcharged. I have a lot of difficult books piled up, so I'm going to consume those. Also, I'm going to Asakusa to take some pictures.
