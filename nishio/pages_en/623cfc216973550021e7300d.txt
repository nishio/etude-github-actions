The "Share Information/Share Information" Issue
Problem that "sharing information," "sharing information," and "information sharing" are almost identical concepts, but systems using string matching make it difficult to equate them.
　I need to come up with a good title.
　[I would like to associate "information sharing" with "information sharing."]

Derived from the above, the problem arises when, in an attempt to summarize them, a particle is deleted from a sentence that says "information sharing is important" and the expression is changed to "information sharing is important".
　The language becomes stilted.
