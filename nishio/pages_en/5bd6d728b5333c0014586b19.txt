Improved physics
 Instead of using the Raicast's RaicastHit.point as the source of force, it is better to use the center of gravity as the source

 Behavior is more natural compared to the version (below) where the ray cast is the source of the force.

  This also includes [physics not allowing slides to get too close].

	Further, the previous version looks natural, but strange behavior is occurring in the lower left corner and other areas. see [Automatic slide movement].
		This is because the action-reaction is not included.
  The subtle difference in front-back position causes the ray cast to hit or not hit, and only the side that is emitting the ray moves, which is counterintuitive to human intuition.
