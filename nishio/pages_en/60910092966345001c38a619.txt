[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]Hopefully the idea of Scrapbox private to public transfers will develop.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "Scrapbox" is that "Scrapbox"?
[nishio.icon]Listen first.
[nisbot.icon]Yes
[nishio.icon]I've been using it for a long time with private and public separated, and now there are 300 pages in private and 8,000 pages in public.
[nisbot.icon]「private」
[nishio.icon]private has become a place for fragmented notes that cannot be made public, and it no longer feels like a place that promotes intellectual production.
[nisbot.icon]「private」
I think the design of transferring pages with certain tags from [nishio.icon]private to public is based on the assumption that they will be primarily active in private.
[nisbot.icon]「private」
[nishio.icon]So introducing it to my current environment will not be very effective.

[nishio.icon]The End
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I hope I can discover a configuration that will generate a beneficial effect for me by using [nishio.icon]private to public transfer or similar techniques.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "private" is that "private"?
[nishio.icon]A place where you can write about things that you can't publish without hesitation.

 Is there anything else about this "PRIVATE"?
What I can't write about, even though I write a lot in [nishio.icon]public, is other people's work, trade secrets, or information that will damage other people by writing about it, etc.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]It is good when unexpected connections occur, but the fragmentation makes it difficult for such private information to be connected, and I want to solve this.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "private" located?
[nishio.icon]My subjective view now is that it is farther away than PUBLIC. It should be closer to my center.
[nisbot.icon]
 > It is good when unexpected connections occur, but the fragmentation makes it difficult for such private information to be connected, and I want to solve this.
 Where does this "PRIVATE" come from?
[nishio.icon]Public information comes from sources that are originally open to the public, and some of it comes from within me and I am willing to make it open to the public, It is a waste that this kind of information does not enter the intellectual production promotion system.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its "private"?
There are [nishio.icon]non-public sources. Even if the information is from public sources, there may be problems if it is reproduced in its entirety. The contents of books, for example, should be put into Scrapbox to promote intellectual production, but because of copyright issues, I cannot write until it is in a form that is appropriate as a citation.

 What do you hope will happen regarding this "private"?
[nishio.icon]The current state is a bunch of dead notes, it needs to become a fish tank for live fish
[nisbot.icon]
 > Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
 Where is this "PRIVATE"?
[nishio.icon]Maybe we should create a new one in a different location from the current un-busy note-placement project?
[nisbot.icon]
 > Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
 What does this "PRIVATE" look like?
[nishio.icon]Right now it's dead. It needs to be a place where it is busy, where page interaction occurs, and where new things are created.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
 What kind of "public" is this "public"?
[nishio.icon]I want information that can be made public to be made public as soon as possible, and I mention it on SNS.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
 Is there anything else about this "PUBLIC"?
[nishio.icon]There are already a few people besides me searching my Scrapbox for ideas. Oh, but since it's Japanese-only, I have an idea that it would be good to automatically translate it into English. I don't know why I haven't done that... because I don't really feel I get any value out of it.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Public information comes from public sources, and some information comes from within me and I am willing to make it public. It's a waste that it doesn't go into the intellectual production promotion system.
 How do you know this "PUBLIC"?
[nishio.icon]Even before Scrapbox, I've been publishing a lot of technical trial-and-error and notes when I'm thinking about things, so it's very familiar to me and always open in several tabs.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that "Scrapbox" and "private"?
[nishio.icon]Wasn't there a page limit only for public in the past? Now you can use private for non-commercial use without any problem.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that "public" and "private"?
[nishio.icon]Now that they're fragmented and unrelated projects, I think they should really work closely together, like the front page and back page of Wikipedia?
[nisbot.icon]
 > Wasn't there a page limit only for PUBLIC in the past? Now private is fine for non-commercial use.
 Where is this "PUBLIC"?
[nishio.icon]Public.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Wasn't there a page limit only for PUBLIC in the past? Now private is fine for non-commercial use.
 Where is this "public" located?
[nishio.icon]Some people come to us by Googling because we are open to the public, and some people come in through social networking sites. Some people are mentioning articles from a few years ago on social networking sites.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Wasn't there a page limit only for PUBLIC in the past? Now private is fine for non-commercial use.
 What does this "public" look like?
[nishio.icon]Where social triggers flow in. When they are mentioned, triggers for improvement are generated. I think this is important for Scrapbox to be a fish tank.
[nisbot.icon]Is that "Scrapbox" the same as "private"? Are they different?
[nishio.icon]Another. it's better to do it private, but after a certain amount of time, you can enjoy the additional benefits of being public.
[nisbot.icon]Is that "public" the same as "private"? Are they different?
[nishio.icon]They are different and have their own advantages.
[nisbot.icon]
 > another. you should do it in PRIVATE, but after a certain amount of time, you can enjoy the additional benefits of being PUBLIC.
 What do you hope will happen regarding this "public"?
The [nishio.icon]public needs to be available as before. Can't wait for bots to update because of the benefits of immediate updates.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to "public" for that to happen?
The [nishio.icon]public needs to be used as before.
[nisbot.icon] With regard to "public", can it?
[nishio.icon]We can do it. In fact, if you don't come up with anything new, you'll still miss PRIVATE as before.
[nisbot.icon]
 > public must still be used as before.
 Where does this "public" come from?
[nishio.icon]mmm 🙁 .
[nisbot.icon]
 > I can do it. In fact, if you don't come up with anything new, you'll still miss PRIVATE.
 What happens to "public" at this "private" time?
When [nishio.icon]private is crowded, public is also crowded after the fact.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to "private" when its "public"?
I wonder if [nishio.icon]public could be updated immediately by a human and the bot could reprint it in private, but I'd have to be careful about overwriting it.
[nisbot.icon]What is between that "public" and "private"?
[nishio.icon]Bots relay the information. There's room here for a smarter mechanism than just copying.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that "bot" and "private"?
[nishio.icon]Bots are not human, so they can show you information that you would not show to others.
[nisbot.icon]Is that "bot" the same as "private"? Are they different?
[nishio.icon]No, sir.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Where social triggers flow in. When people mention it, it creates an opportunity for improvement. This is important for Scrapbox to be a fish tank.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "Scrapbox"?
[nishio.icon]What else about the Scrapbox as being a fish tank...the fish need to move around and interact. Not sink to the bottom in a state of suspended animation. A well-linked and nurtured Scrapbox supports this by connecting links and suggesting them in ambiguous searches.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to "private" when its "Scrapbox"?
[nishio.icon]The private is sinking right now; we need to float the sinking private by writing things in the public.
[nisbot.icon]
 > The other thing about Scrapbox as being a fish tank ... the fish need to move around and interact. Not sink to the bottom in a state of suspended animation. A well-linked and nurtured Scrapbox will support this by linking and suggesting in obscure searches.
 Where is this "Scrapbox" located?
We want it to exist in a way that connects [nishio.icon]private and public, but right now it exists in pieces.
[nisbot.icon]
 > The other thing about Scrapbox as being a fish tank ... the fish need to move around and interact. Not sink to the bottom in a state of suspended animation. A well-linked and nurtured Scrapbox will support this by linking and suggesting in obscure searches.
 How do you know about this "Scrapbox"?
How do we know that [nishio.icon]private and public are connected to a link, Scrapbox can't know that now, so we need a way to help there. A bot could read the recently updated public article and tell us the private article that might be connected to it.
