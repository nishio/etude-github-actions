 *1299195668* Regarding the cheating case.
 Reprinted from Twitter
 
 >>
 I was wondering if maybe there is still a lot of excitement about cheating cases on TV and such, or why there are so many opinions defending cheaters, but I thought it might be that the social sanctions by the media are excessive? I don't watch TV, so I thought the only people talking about it were, at best, university officials...
 <<
 
 Or, to be more precise, university officials and "a few people who beat up on anyone they can beat up on."
 
 >>
 If the punishment for cheating is to deprive the cheater of the right to pass the exam on which he or she cheated, it will not work as a deterrent because the cheater will say, "I won't pass the exam without cheating anyway, so I'll just take my chances. It is not a deterrent. To be continued
 <<
 
 In fact, if I remember correctly, TOEIC was "Refuse to take the exam in the future" and the university I was in was "Stripped of all credits for the semester".
 
 >>
 So I thought it was reasonable to punish severely in order to work as a deterrent, and I wondered about the opinions defending the students, but I see it's been in the news all along... then I can understand the argument that it's "too much". I mean, we don't need to bully such individual cases, we need to discuss a system that doesn't recur...
