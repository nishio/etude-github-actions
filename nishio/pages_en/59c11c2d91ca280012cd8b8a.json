#Management Games

	Selection of Investment Targets
 	Management is the allocation of resources
  Complex entanglements make optimal allocation non-trivial
	 	[economies of scale], increasing yield, network externalities: better to add to something big and make it even bigger
   Diminishing returns: Contrary to economies of scale, as you get bigger, the cost of getting even bigger increases.
   Sunk cost: When something you have invested in becomes less profitable due to changes in the environment, etc., you should not use it as a factor in your decision because "investments made in the past" cannot be recovered, but people tend to think that it is "too good to throw away" what they have gained by investing a lot.
   Time delay: humans tend to overlook impacts when a time delay exists before the impact appears
  [Cookie clicker] type games are games in which the player allocates which of the diminishing harvest options to reinvest profits.
