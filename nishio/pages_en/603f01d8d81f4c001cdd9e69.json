ã€€Thoughts.
ã€€ã€€Known to be attributed to minimum cuts
ã€€ã€€No more than two choices, but [at least 3 choices with a minimum cut] is acceptable.
ã€€ã€€But the range of v is up to 10^6, so it's hard to make all of them vertices.
ã€€ã€€Is it necessary to [compress coordinates] to select only vertices that are relevant to the constraints?
ã€€ã€€ã€€If the potency is positive, it is more profitable to include up to a-1 just before the constraint.
ã€€ã€€ã€€If the potency is negative, it is beneficial to stop just short of the constraint b

ã€€ã€€The irregular number of vertices is a pain to implement...
