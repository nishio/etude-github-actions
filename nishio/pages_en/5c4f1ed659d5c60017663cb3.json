Four stages after lifting of the ban on double-duty
	Stage 1:
		Good to be [fully committed] to the company
		Doing [multiple jobs] = not fully committed to the company
		I see duplication of work as a bad thing.
 Stage 2:
 	Experienced double-dealers bring a lot of things back to the company.
 	Increased awareness that "duplication of work benefits the company."
	Third stage:
		Seeing the achievements of those with experience in compounding business accumulate, inexperienced people feel like they have to compound their own business too.
		It has become an objective to do multiple jobs.
		They are influenced by other people's values.
	Stage 4:
		My main purpose in life is my life's purpose, and duplication of work is just one of the means to achieve it.
		You can do multiple jobs or make a full commitment to the company,
		It's your choice.
