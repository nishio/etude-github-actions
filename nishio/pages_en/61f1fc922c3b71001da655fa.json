stepping stone slow jog
There were stepping stones on the walkway, and I thought these were for the elderly, or maybe they had narrow strides and were hard to walk on.
I realized that if I did a [slow jog], it was just the right width.

There is a stretch in the Achilles tendon.
Now that there's some stretching on the plains, stepping stones may be overkill.
