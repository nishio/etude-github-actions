Twitterで文章を削る訓練
I saw a statement that removing superfluous words from a sentence improves it, and Twitter is perfect for this exercise because the word count is displayed in real time. First, write long sentences that exceed the word limit, and then try to keep them within the limit. Just by playing the puzzle-like game, you naturally acquire the skill of word-crunching. This tweet also fits the word limit.

When I do this exercise, I realize that my sentences are full of katakana words, with strange word order and long words. In a word, thin. It is not necessary to always write [dense sentences]. But trying to write creates the ability to sense the density and thinness of a sentence. This is similar to how art students cultivate the ability to see things "correctly" during the process of long hours of "drawing" training.
