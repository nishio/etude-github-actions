Effect of backlinks
I wrote about the effectiveness of [backlinks] because you asked me to get the opinion of Mr. Nishio, who usually uses [Scrapbox] with backlinks.

https://scrapbox.io/nishio/社会的証明

There you will see a page that records the use of that keyword in a specific conversation.
https://scrapbox.io/nishio/高速道路のたとえ

For the [abstract concept] page, [concrete] examples are supplemented to clarify the meaning, and the [concrete examples page] provides explanations for abstract concepts that are used without explanation.

bad example
 All "concrete conversations" and very few abstractions of them.
 　Example: Chat conversations and then "what was that?" after a year because no one keeps them organized.
　All "abstractions" and no concrete conversations.
　　Example: There is a work procedure document in the company wiki, but it is wrong, and the first time user has to have a conversation with others to solve the problem, but the same thing is repeated because the conversation takes place in a place that is disconnected from the document.

When Scrapbox operations are ideally turned around, they support the process of [crystallizing] abstract concepts.
　Scrapbox takes [2 hop link] one step further than backlinks. This is very useful.
	[Scrapbox reminds me of what I've forgotten].
	[It is not enough to have pages of concrete facts and pages of abstract concepts.]
