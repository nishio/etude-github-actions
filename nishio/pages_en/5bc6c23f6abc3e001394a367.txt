code::
 x.index_fill_?
 Docstring:
 index_fill_(dim, index, val) -> Tensor
 
 Fills the elements of the :attr:`self` tensor with value :attr:`val` by
 selecting the indices in the order given in :attr:`index`.
 
 Args:
     dim (int): dimension along which to index
     index (LongTensor): indices of :attr:`self` tensor to fill in
     val (float): the value to fill with
 
 Example::
     >>> x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], dtype=torch.float)
     >>> index = torch.tensor([0, 2])
     >>> x.index_fill_(1, index, -1)
     tensor([[-1.,  2., -1.],
             [-1.,  5., -1.],
             [-1.,  8., -1.]])
 Type:      builtin_function_or_method
Error if index is an empty Tensor

>Expected object of type torch.FloatTensor but found type torch.LongTensor


code::
	scatter_(dim, index, src) -> Tensor
 
 Args:
     dim (int): the axis along which to index
     index (LongTensor): the indices of elements to scatter
     src (Tensor or float): the source element(s) to scatter
