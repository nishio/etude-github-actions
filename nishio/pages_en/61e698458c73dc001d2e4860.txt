>Creating change in people's lives by delivering products, services, information, entertainment, and ideas in a realistic and easily accessible environment.
> In September 2019, we received approval from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications to apply for a new BS broadcasting channel, and established a company specializing in BS broadcasting program planning and program production, with the aim of opening a BS broadcasting channel in 2021.
> Our goal is to become a channel that "connects" all the wonderful things by selecting and introducing wonderful products, services, information, entertainment and ideas that are buried in the world, and spreading "excitement" through changes in our lives.
