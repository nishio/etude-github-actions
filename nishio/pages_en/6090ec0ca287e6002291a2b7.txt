 What is Cybozu Labs doing these days? We have been asked this question. Actually, in cooperation with the head office, we have been introducing various activities on our blog <a href='http://developer.cybozu.co.jp/tech/'>Cybozu Inside Out</a>, but it seems that we are still not very well known. We have selected a few that our Lab employees are involved with and will introduce them to you. The difference between Cybozu Inside Out and <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/'>Cybozu Style</a> is that Cybozu Inside Out is a blog for engineers. We hope you will take this opportunity to learn more about Cybozu Inside Out.
