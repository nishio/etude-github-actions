 I politely declined, saying that I could not interview them if they jumped in out of the blue, so I asked them to bring their resumes.

 I plan to bring Chumby and some appropriate educational toys.

 Oh, I see there's a lot of talk about "so-called non-PCs" this time. I'm bringing my Chumby too.
 
 >>
 17:17 (yoshiori) Oh, I have a soldering iron!

 It's kind of starting to go off the rails in the direction of the day after tomorrow before it even starts.

 As usual, the presentation will be broadcast on Ustream and uploaded to Nico Nico Douga. The after-party this time is not at an izakaya (Japanese style pub), so it may be broadcasted as well.
 
 *1211536524*Re: String pattern created by using all characters once each
 String patterns that can be made using all characters once each - Tech Notes @ ama-ch http://d.hatena.ne.jp/ama-ch/20080523/1211529804
 
 Original:
 >|python|
 def pat(arr, level=0, base=""):
     num = len(arr)
     if num == 0:
         print base
     for i in range(num + level):
         if num > i:
             arrclone = arr.replace(arr[i], "")
             pat(arrclone, level+1, base+arr[i])
 ||<
 
 I cut out the parts I didn't want.
 
 >|python|
 def pat(arr, base=""):
     num = len(arr)
     if num == 0:
         print base
     for i in range(num):
         arrclone = arr.replace(arr[i], "")
         pat(arrclone, base+arr[i])
 ||<
 
 I also changed the name to my liking.
 
 >|python|
 >>> def make_permutation(chars, base=""):
     if not chars:
 	print base
     else:
         for i in range(len(chars)):
             new_chars = chars.replace(chars[i], "")
             make_permutation(new_chars, base + chars[i])
 
             
 >>> make_permutation("abc")
 abc
 acb
 bac
 bca
 cab
 cba
 ||<
 
 But I haven't read the original problem spec, but I think the method of using replace for strings causes problems when the same character is contained in more than one string.
 >|python|
 >>> make_permutation("aab")
 ab
 ab
 ba
 ba
 ||<
 
 Since replace can specify the number of items, if you only replace one item, you will get a result, but you will see both aab where the first a comes first and aab where the second one comes first.
 
 >|diff|
 -            new_chars = chars.replace(chars[i], "")
 +            new_chars = chars.replace(chars[i], "", 1)
 ||<
 
 Oh, I shouldn't have done that. I'll continue another time.
