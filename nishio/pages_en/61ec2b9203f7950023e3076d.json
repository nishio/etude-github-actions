Transparent handling of multiple projects
from [/villagepump/multiple projects transparently].
A mechanism to solve the problem of not being able to connect scrapbox projects, which has been mentioned in various places.

What you can do.
	You can refer to it from your project whether you write it in [/hub] or [/villagepump].
		Of course, the reverse is also possible
	What you write in a private project can be referenced from a public project.
	　Even if you divide what you write out into public or private, you can still connect the pages as if it was all your idea.
	　This is probably the most attractive feature.
What you can't do.
 Connect all projects that exist in scrapbox.io
 　It's no wonder you can't.
 Connect all [External Project Link
  Difficult to get a list of [External Project Link] on each page in [Scrapbox's API].

method
 link to
  Using [ScrapBubble]@0.2.0 or later
  The linking method has been changed from the conventional method using Indexed DB, so that external projects can be immediately treated as if they were the same project.
 Connect input completion
  [external-completion]
  The latest beta version is buggy and left out.
   I will fix it soon[/villagepump/takker.icon].
	[- combine the following three].
	　(WIP)[scrapbox-text-bubble]
	　 Allow text preview only in a pre-defined [external project].
	　 Note that if you make it possible to display the contents of all [external projects] in the dark, you will get the [satisfied with just posting the link] phenomenon.
 	　 cf. [/daiiz/[daiizScript] Forgoing the cross-project text preview function].

 	　 [/villagepump//icons/naru.icon][/villagepump/yosider.icon]
 	　 If the page is interesting, I think I would want to do this kind of work even if I could preview the contents.
 	　 I find it very time-consuming to copy a page from an external project that I have previewed to my own project, change it to citation notation, and then add comments[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 	　 It's a hassle, so it's doubtful they'll actually do the work.
 	　 With quotation notation, I feel like I can't mess with the content[/villagepump/yosider.icon].
 	　 I'm not allowed to tamper with it to make it a [citation under copyright law].
 	　 I want to use the words in the [my project] link.
	　 It would be interesting to create an icon of that person in your project without permission, and then add the icon to the person's statements, so that you are virtually writing in Scrapbox in collaboration with that person[/villagepump/yosider.icon].
	　 [self-made].
 	　 [public project], that could be a problem.
 	　 Is it performance-wise ok to be able to preview all external project links...?
 	　 　It's not a big deal, just hit [/scrapboxlab//api/pages/$projectname/$pagetitle] once!
 	　 　And the notation parse is instantaneous.
 	　 　[/villagepump//icons2/hee~.icon].
 	　 I feel like I need to know the `$projectname` of every external project to be able to ["display the contents of all external projects in the dark"], but is it possible to get it?
 	　  It's easy to do, just PREVIEW the linked page!
 	　   Because the link itself contains `$projectname`, the

 The first is not yet implemented, so it is still incomplete, but it can be handled quite transparently even in its current state.
 　You can suggest links written in another project.
 　	[/takker/external-completion-2]
 　You can suggest another page with the same link.
