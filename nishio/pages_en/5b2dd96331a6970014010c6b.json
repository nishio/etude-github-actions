Organize on top
 [Scrapbox] or rather the Wiki concept see [Wiki mode].
 Humans usually read new pages from top to bottom
 So it should be as organized as the top.
 Write down miscellaneous notes and thoughts in a sloppy manner, then add organized ones [* on top].
 The more RAW ones should go on the bottom.
 Given that, when you [quote] and refer to something, should the reference be on top and the quote on the bottom?
