The fool learns from experience, the wise learn from history
A quote by Otto von [Bismarck]. In Japan, I often see it translated as "fools learn from experience and wise men learn from history. This expression seems to suggest that learning from experience is a bad thing and that one should read history books.

原文
>Nur ein Idiot glaubt, aus den eigenen Erfahrungen zu lernen. Ich ziehe es vor, aus den Erfahrungen anderer zu lernen, um von vorneherein eigene Fehler zu vermeiden.
Google翻訳
> Only an idiot believes to learn from their own experiences. I prefer to learn from the experience of others in order to avoid mistakes of my own.
>I believe that only fools learn from their own experience. I prefer to learn from others experiences to avoid my own mistakes.

Therefore, the "learning from history" referred to here is "[learning from] the experiences of others. Learning from history books may be included in "learning from other people's experience," but seeing the mistakes others made yesterday and taking care not to make the same mistakes yourself is also included in "learning from other people's experience. The translation "history" narrows the field of vision more than necessary.
