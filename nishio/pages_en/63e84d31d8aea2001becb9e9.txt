You don't notice the disability is gone.

　1: Trying to go to goal G from a certain start S, but hitting an [obstacle] on the way, [change of course] and [compromise] at a different goal G'.
　2: Think it would be smoother if you changed the policy from the start instead of changing it after you hit a bump.
　3: The obstacles are gone with the passage of time, but without realizing it, we assume the "smooth path to the compromise goal" is the right one and repeat it.

This is the kind of conversation we're having in a situation where (1) is no longer experienced and (2) is being repeated.
　conversation
　　New person: "Why don't you go straight to G? Why do you go to G' instead of G?"
　　Old people "have been doing it all along!"
　When new people try out their ideas,
　　I could easily go straight ahead and get to G and be like, "What was that all about?" (3)
　　Or the obstacle hasn't gone away again, and you hit it the same way as (1) and say "I see...".
　Those who choose to repeat themselves, convinced by "I've been doing it all along," will be extensions of (2).

[the principle of generation of old people], but this is not so much the behavior of an individual as the principle of an organization sticking to inefficient methods.
　[Organization sticking together].
　[Organizational inertia]

[Technical debt] is also likely to include code that, under the circumstances at the time it was created, had to be implemented by bending the ideal G and implementing it with G', or straight and straightforward, but was no longer necessary due to subsequent changes in circumstances.
