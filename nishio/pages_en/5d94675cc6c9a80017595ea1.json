The constraint is a hypothesis.
	When [constraints] are strong, the design tends to become more complex in an attempt to manage within those constraints.
	Is that [constraint] really real?
	There are cases where "constrained" is not a fact but [an interpretation] # Fact and Interpretation
	[Let's test our hypothesis by experimenting] #Hypothesis testing
