Sentence generation takes multiple words as input
	LSTM internal states generated by one word are far from the distribution of internal states in training
 Should be able to type multiple words
 	Ignore words that are not in your vocabulary.

	It might be interesting to separately train a function that returns a scalar value [whether the internal state of LSTM is close to the state being trained or not].
