Consistency of decision criteria
[Consistency of [criteria].
One person said, "
	In the past, I decided that B should take precedence over A with [decision criterion] as X. Now I have decided that B should take precedence over A with [decision criterion] as X.
	Now, if X is the criterion, then D should take precedence over C, but it seems to me that C should take precedence.
	But there is no [consistency]. I don't know if this is the right thing to do.
I was struggling with the idea.

Good.

It was a mistake to verbalize "X is the criterion" in T1 during the previous decision-making process.
	They were unaware that there was another axis, Y.
	He finally realized this when he saw a case where the difference in X was not so great and the difference in Y was large.

It is important to realize the mistake.
	Mistakes should be corrected.
	[To err and not change, this is called a mistake].

[Mistakes in decision-making] and [mistakes in the language of decision-making methods] are two different things.
	[Rules of unknown value should be discarded.]
