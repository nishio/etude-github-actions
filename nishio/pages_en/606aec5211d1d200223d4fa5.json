 Before, we had to name the content in the items of flex by class name and apply CSS to control the size.
 　In the after, the class name is added to the items themselves.
 　Instead of setting a fixed size with width, let it be adjusted with flex.
 The div that wraps the button is fixed to the size of its content with `flex-basis: auto;`.
 The div in the input field is filled with a fixed value of basis, and then grow is used to fill the available space.
 　The input field inside matches the size of the div outside.
  code:css
   div.input-icon {
     flex-basis: 120px;
     flex-grow: 1;
   }
   div.input-icon > div {
     width: 100%;
   }
　The page title needs to be longer if possible, and the project name does not need to be much longer, this is expressed by the different values of grow
　　There may be a better way to go about this.

[Flexbox]
