Many people feel this is the right thing to do, but why?
　Receive rebuttals, pointers, and additional information in response to what you have published.
　　One of the reasons it stands out because it is a direct response
　Better understanding of personality
　　It's not so obvious, but I think the impact here is more significant.
　　By continuing to disseminate information, we gain a better understanding of the personality of the person, saying, "This person is interested in this kind of thing, and has this kind of knowledge.
　　As a result, when some need arises, you will be called upon.
　　　For example, "I have an event like this, would you like to attend?" or "Would you like to give a speech at this kind of event?" or "Would you give a speech at such and such an event?
　　Nothing can be observed from the sender himself in the phase of spreading personality understanding.
　[Social Trigger]
　　Know the social demand
　　Know what [knowledge of long-term value] is.
