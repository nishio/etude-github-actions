Unexpected token o in JSON
code:Deno 1.20.4
 > JSON.parse({})
 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
     at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)

The error occurred when JSON.parse was done again by mistake when JSON.parse had already been done.
	(In [Next.js], I assumed that req.body contained a string and did JSON.parse, but it was kindly already parsed, so there was no need.)

Why "token o" because it is implicitly toString.
code:Deno 1.20.4
 > {}.toString()
 "[object Object]"

On Chrome, the error is a little more obvious.
code:Chrome 105.0.5195.102
 JSON.parse({})
