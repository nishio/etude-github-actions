I don't care about the details, I care about the big picture.
>"I don't care about the details" but "I care about the big picture" to the max. Then you "stop worrying about the details". When you determine what is more important and "care about it to the max", you "stop caring about the details" as a result. You fill the frame with other "dos" rather than a sense of "don't."

Since "don't" is not an action, there is another "do," and that is "identify what is most important in the whole."
Similar to "[identify bottlenecks] first."

[general view].
