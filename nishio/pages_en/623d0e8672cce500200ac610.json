Scaffolding Network
2022-03-25
 I thought about it after [an experiment to import a wiki into Scrapbox].
	　Not [keyword extraction
	　Not [link suggestion] either.
	　Automatically build a temporary network as "[scaffolding],
	　Humans should be able to move over it at high speed.
	　Related: [fast travel in knowledge networks].

　Impressions after using it
　　Finding 3 relevant pages out of 300 pages is difficult without links, it can be
　　Generating "Questions
　　　'What kind of sentence relates to this part of this sentence?'
　　The link fails from time to time.
　　　This also strongly generates the question
　　　　'What? These strings of letters are keywords? What on earth did they have in common?"
　　　There are some things we don't have in common after reading this.
　　　But it's the driving force behind the organizing.
　　　　Two of the three are more appropriate to change the position of the dividing line.
　　　　

code::
 Notation shake
		[Drucker, Japan]
 	[Drucker, until the end, Japan].
 	[Drucker, now Japan].
This is not an appropriate keyword, but it does successfully link Drucker to three things that have been written about Japan
