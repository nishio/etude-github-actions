 *1342315553* Easy way to remove ring stains (whitening) from desks.
 I accidentally put a hot pan on my desk and the area turned white. I looked into the possibility of doing something about it, but all the hurdles, such as polishing and repainting it or buying expensive chemicals, were too high, so I ended up leaving it as it was.
 
 Yesterday I suddenly noticed that the whitening was gone in the shape of the bottom of the cup. If this is the case, I wonder if it can be cleaned up without the need to use chemicals?

 I'm trying to reproduce it to see if it was caused by condensation from the cold stuff in the cup and left in a "pool of water on the desk". Leave it in this state overnight.

 I woke up in the morning to check and the bleaching is gone!

 So I cover it with a wet tissue and leave it for an hour.

 Cleaned up!
 
 However, after a while, it gradually starts to float. 1 hour may not be enough. I will cover it again this night and go to bed.
 
 
 By the way, this desk is PVC veneer.
 
 2012-10-18 Postscript: After doing the "cover with a wet tissue and leave overnight" twice after this, I can't tell where the whitening was. It's been 3 months since then, and I don't see any signs of recovery. I'm happy and satisfied.
