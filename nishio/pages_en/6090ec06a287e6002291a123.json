 *1291822526*I spoke at the Python Workshop.
 I was surprised at how spacious the IIJ venue was. It was quite wonderful to have power and wifi available for that many people.

 I'm sleepy, so I'll continue later.

 About the Panel Session

 @takahashim I forgot to mention that it's good to try other languages anyway, so you can see the pros and cons of the language you usually use!

 Oh, I failed to mention that too!
 
 
 And "You want me to tell you what's good about Python? I can't be such a narcissist, but I dare say... it's the indentation" is a tendon joke based on the fact that the person who spoke first praised indentation. I didn't plan to praise indentation, or rather, I didn't think the order was delimited, so I thought that if I disparaged Python every time someone praised Python, everyone would praise Python desperately and I would be debunked and "Conclusion: Python is great" (yeah!).
 
 On the topic of "appearances are 90% of a person", I have not read the book itself, so I don't know in what context the term is used. But what is important is that neither indented blocking, explicit self, nor the presence of regular expression literals are just appearances. The latter can be achieved by just putting a preprocessor on it, and as id:moriyoshi hacked in the LT, it is possible to stop blocking by indentation.
 
 I think all the panelists would agree that "you should try other languages. However, I don't think it's good if you talk to a lot of people while saying, "You should try talking to a lot of people," and all you do is look at their titles and appearances.
 
 Python has a global interpreter lock, so it is not as good at parallel processing as Java. Python has only static scope, which Guido thought was good, and it can be switched with dynamic scope like Perl (so I didn't understand the advantage of dynamic scope, but it seems to be useful to be able to separate the valid range of a variable on a time axis only in a specific thread when multithreading).
 
 Perhaps it is inevitable that our impression is determined by our outward appearance, but I still think we should pay more attention to our inner lives!
