Q: Some people may see information that gives them a "chance to notice blind spots" but still think "that can't be true" due to cognitive dissonance. What should we do with such people in terms of augmenting the organization? How do we educate them? Wednesday, September 17, 1462

[https://gyazo.com/efe92380e6b9349844dc29a1c9462109]
A: I will be explaining the "U Theory" that is trying to answer that very point at the Kyoto University Summer Design School starting 9/24, and I will be presenting the material...http://www.design.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sds2014/ja/theme01... html 63 Wednesday, September 17, 14

[https://gyazo.com/71839683a1f12bf9f7055ee211bae2b0]
A: I have two points to make. First, the "how to change others" stance will not work. You need to change yourself.Wednesday, September 17, 1464

[https://gyazo.com/c84b953c3d291c6ff9b8459b935278f1]
A: Next, realize that it is common for people, including yourself, to get into a state of "seeing but not seeing. "Wednesday, September 17, 1465

[https://gyazo.com/1c7875b22363d38415e3b754c23c57d8]
A: It can be small at first, and you should accumulate "success stories" that yield beneficial results from your awareness. This will give you confidence.Wednesday, September 17, 1466

A: Hypotheses are created from experience. The feeling of "understanding" is also a hypothesis. Hypotheses need to be tested by experimentation. Act on the understanding and check the results Wednesday, September 17, 1473

[https://gyazo.com/ec2ecd588e57bc9a3f096ad1e8902d6e]
A: If the results of an action differ from expectations, the model needs to be modified. Repeating this process creates a "likely correct" model, which is then combined to create a larger model. This is one methodology Wednesday, September 17, 1474

[https://gyazo.com/55e21b74f4048c2582234ba24201b201]
A: Another methodology, the KJ method or grounded theory, is used in the humanities, where experimentation is not easy.14 Wednesday, September 17, 75

[https://gyazo.com/286e68272900d8d513bb8720f27e5efa]
A: First collect a large amount of data from interviews, etc., and then list it without filtering it out with your own biases and saying "this is noise" Wednesday, September 17, 14, 76

A: Human working memory is only about seven, but if you put the data on paper and spread it out on a desk, you can see 100 or 200 Wednesday, September 17, 14, 77

[https://gyazo.com/41165932d7952bdcccf8ee0dbd6f0a50]
A: After making a list of 100 data, build a model by moving them around on the desk. This is the KJ method (I failed to mention this at the meeting, but it is also important to build a structure from the data bottom-up, rather than applying [the existing structure] top-down) (By the way, my book and the feature article introduced in (Incidentally, my book and featured article introduced in the above are modeled by the KJ method on Wednesday, September 17, 200278)

Question Q in Oﬃce Hour: Aren't the 5 ways to notice blind spots not parallel but back and forth in time? Wednesday, September 17, 1479.

[https://gyazo.com/13ce926778f4b1fa12ea4681cf0f47e6]
A: That was a blind spot! It's true that abstractions can't be used out of the blue, right from the start. If someone with no programming experience reads a book on design patterns, they won't be able to connect it to their own experience.Wednesday, September 17, 1480

[https://gyazo.com/19090fc3db0420f10b458ede89bf713c]
Q: How can we share our testing expertise among testers (detailed situation description omitted) Wednesday 9/17/14 81

[https://gyazo.com/742ef63d4304908f71e1305bb93bc21f]
A: It seems to me that the question is how to share knowledge that is not verbalized. One methodology is "working together. "82 Wednesday, 9/17/14

[https://gyazo.com/6e9e54c395305cce9d5b6980ffa52594]
A: By working together, know-how can be shared without verbalization. Furthermore, separating "those who instruct without operating and those who operate" encourages the verbalization of knowledge in order to instruct.14 Wednesday, September 17, 2002Reference "A group of mediocre geniuses can beat a lone genius. "83

[https://gyazo.com/78ecec7921a8ba1333ef099f33efb60f]
A: Only when verbalization is done can manualization, etc. be done. Linguization is a rather difficult task, so if it is suddenly left to each individual without training that skill, it will not work.Wednesday, September 17, 1484
