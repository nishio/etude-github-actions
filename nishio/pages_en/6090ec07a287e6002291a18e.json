 2: Look down, saying things like, "Wow, that's amazing.
 3: Look at the bottom photo and say, "Huh? Didn't this guy show up in the first one?" I think.
 4: Scroll back to the beginning and I still think it's the same person.
 5: You realize that the second and third person are the same person.
 6: Comparing the second person's after makeup with the third person's after makeup, "I don't recognize this!" and make a fuss
 7: Shocked when it is pointed out that "they are all the same person
 8: Look at everyone's makeup before again and agree that they are all the same person except for the second and fourth from the bottom.
 9: Claims that "the second one from the bottom rather resembles Ryoko Tani than the others," but is told that's not an argument.
 10: I'm not convinced that the second from the bottom and the fourth from the bottom are the same person, but since the moles are in the same position, I'm giving up and wondering if they are the same person... ‚Üê here now
