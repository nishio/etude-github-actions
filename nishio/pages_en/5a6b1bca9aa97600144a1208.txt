Why software becomes unstable year after year
	Unlike matter, it is made of information and should not itself deteriorate, but what causes deterioration?

  Constantly changing operating environment, including OS and libraries
  Deterioration of materialized information (damage to storage media)
  The number of modules involved in the operation may increase, but never decrease.
   nishio It is an interesting angle that the number of modules increases as we try to maintain compatibility. It is likely to fail sooner or later because the probability of problems occurring due to combination compatibility increases on the order of the square.
  Unexpected inputs and outputs cause unexpected changes in internal conditions and undermine stability
 At first glance, it may seem straightforward to say, "We must pay the cost of adapting to changes in the external world," but there are many things we don't understand, such as "Why does the external world change?" and "Why do we need to adapt to changes in the external world?" and "Why aren't we paying the cost of adaptation?"
