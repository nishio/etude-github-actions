	Why not on the radar chart?
	ã€€Because there are an infinite number of axes, and the radar chart masks the fact that new things can be created.
 	Same as I wrote in [radar chart and knowledge distribution chart#5add661caff09e00006b33a0
   Radar charts have a finite definition range.
   	Definition range of knowledge distribution map is infinite
   	There's a sense that new fields of knowledge are being created all the time.
