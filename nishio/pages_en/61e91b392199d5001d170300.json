(4.3.1.2) ❷ Preview
[❷ Preview]

The "preview" step is a similar concept as described in [(1.3.2.3) Grasp the overall picture roughly]. First of all, you need to [grasp the whole picture], instead of reading all the contents in detail.

This step is further divided into "[survey]" and "[find the keywords]." In "[survey]" step, you [collect information] from the front cover, back cover, and [table of contents]. In "[find the keywords]" step, you open the book every 20 pages, find words which look important, and record them.

The time to preview is about 5 minutes per book. After this rough [information gathering], you ask yourself whether to read this book. Or, you ask whether you change the [purpose] set in [❶ Preparation].
