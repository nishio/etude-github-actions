Predictive links and unforeseen missing links
 [Link to forecast]
  I can [bracket] a page with that title, thinking that it would exist, and the link turns blue to confirm that the page was indeed there.
 [unforeseen missing link].
  I bracketed the page with that title because I thought it would exist, but then the link turns red and I'm like, "What? Didn't I write that?"
  This is an opportunity.
  	A real case of "what I thought was written was not written".
   	Write now only the minimum
    Or just leave the keywords there.
   Cases that were written but expressed differently
    Are those two expressions the same thing or do they have different nuances?
    	[Note the differences in similarities].
    If it's just a typographical error, correcting it will correct all the links together.
    If it's a notational quirk, you can add a link and it will connect to whichever representation you write.
    If there is a difference between the two nuances, [understanding] can be taken a step further by writing down how they differ.
