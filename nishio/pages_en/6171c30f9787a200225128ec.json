what is usual
When you say "X is [the norm]," to whom is it the norm?
　You're claiming it's the norm for everyone.
　You're merely saying that it's the norm for you.
　The former is a pretty strong argument

When you learn something in your field, you start to feel that a lot of things are "normal".
　This is remarkable when you write a commentary book
　　What is it? Should I explain this content? Should I write it down because it's obvious?"
　Even what you feel is "obvious" is not obvious to most readers, so you should explain it if the amount of space allows.
　　It's usually the quantity that doesn't allow for it, so you'll have to worry about it.

Bias to write about things that are not obvious.
　Maybe lower quality of output in the long run (untested)
　Related to [truth is the best measure in the long run]?
　The author's own sense of what is "natural" and the reader's sense of what is not.

Regarding readers who say "this is a matter of course" in response to something written about the obvious.
　This is someone who understands the subject of the commentary very well and should be respected.
　People who unconsciously generalize what they consider "normal" from their own perspective.
　　That "what is obvious to you is not obvious to other readers because it is not obvious to them."

When you take for granted what others have written.
　I tend to say "of course" too, but maybe that's not such a good thing.
　After all, "natural" is subjective, so the statement may not lead to constructive discussion!
