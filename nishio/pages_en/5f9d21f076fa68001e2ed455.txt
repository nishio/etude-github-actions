　Thoughts.
　　The strange problem of making a tree with almost the smallest whole area.
　　O(ElogE) when [minimum global tree] is obtained by [Kruskal method)
　　　There are 5000 points, so there are about 10^7 edges.
　　　It's a little tough. It takes 200 to calculate the distance.
　　Is the key that the input is guaranteed to be random?
　　First, divide the point approximately in half
　　　Just focus on one axis and divide by positive and negative.
　　　The cost of the Kruskal method is halved because the sides are 1/4 of the cost of the Kruskal method.
　　　The cost of connecting the two parts is high if you are trying to find the best edge, but this is fine if you connect them properly, only 2 at most worse than in the best case.
　　　In fact, with [the curse of dimensionality], the distance of almost all points is around 1
　　I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it in half the time.
　　　If they don't make it in time, they need to be broken into smaller pieces.
　　　Judging from the minimum score of the sample, you can divide it into 16 pieces and connect them appropriately.
　Official Explanation
　　It's 200 dimensions, so I'm dividing it into 200 pieces.
　　You don't do that and prove that it fits within 1.01 times the optimal solution...
