Shareholders should rather ignore them if they want innovation.

 Hmmm.
 This reminded me of "[If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have asked for a faster horse]." It reminded me of "[If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have asked for a faster horse]" ([Henry Ford]).
 	What [Ford https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ヘンリー%E3%83%BBフォード] is saying, in essence, is "ignore the needs of your customers."
 That's difficult. I wonder if that's really the right thing to do.
 PS: Isn't "Ignore your customers' needs... I don't think "customers don't always know the best method to meet their needs." I see you don't ignore the need for "fast and comfortable transportation." But if a customer says, "I want a fast horse," you can't just take it literally and research fast horses.

		Henry Ford said that customers don't always know what they want. <br>They cannot want something that is unknown to them in the first place. <br>I think this means that we should not listen to the voice of the customer, but rather give shape to what the customer really wants.

		It's like "[two shoe sales]." I think it's an important idea.
