The game is to spawn in an asteroid and survive by gathering resources from the surrounding area. You need to produce oxygen and food to survive.
Instead of moving around and working directly yourself, you give instructions to in-game characters to do the work. Since manpower is limited, production equipment is automated and human movement routes are designed to be efficient.
As they can afford it, they can place entertainment facilities and have their characters live happily.

I associate it with [Factorio] in terms of production automation, but it's also challenging because not only do things pass through the pipeline, but they also interact with heat, so it's necessary to keep the living environment comfortable.
