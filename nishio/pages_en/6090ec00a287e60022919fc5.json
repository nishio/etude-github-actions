 *1246839469*Diary for Monday
 Itchy eyeballs...
 
 
 Looks like the EX-F1 can be rented for 10,000 yen for a night or two. I'm looking forward to <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090705/1246778484'>Itoyanagi Miku Shattering</a> (oh).
 
 
 VIVIPRI, the mailbox is dated yesterday and is complete. I'll go look for it.
 
 
 Sneezing. My nose is also runny. The pile of pocket tissues I got at the station is being consumed. It's a good thing.

 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090629/1246276684'>Tried Yodobashi Camera's e-Photo Net Service - Yasukazu Nishio's Hatena Diary</a>.

 The edge has been cut off by about 1mm. 4 A4 sheets for 1,888 yen.

 The edges have been cut off, but it's the same. 1245 yen for 5 A4 sheets. However, the color seems to have been corrected in the direction of darkening (Yodobashi's label said NNNN A. I'm not sure what the A means).
 
 I have to make a smaller image because it is inevitable that it will be cut off if it is printed to the very edge of the paper.
