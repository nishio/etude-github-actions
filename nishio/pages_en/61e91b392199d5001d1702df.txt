(4.4.1.3) Climbing books and hiking books
There are two types of books, [climbing books] and [hiking books]. 

The [climbing book] builds concepts [step by step]. It is like [mountain climbing]. [If you do not understand the first half well, you can not understand the second half at all.]

The [hiking book] expresses various concepts [one after another]. Even if you skip some contents, it does not harm you.

[Takada Akinori] says the [purpose] of [hiking book] is not reaching the top of the mountain but is [enjoying the scenery]. For example, in this chapter, I introduce several reading techniques side by side. [By comparing] multiple reading techniques, we can refine the understanding of reading. However, most readers do not have experiences with multiple reading techniques. So we need to look them [roughly first]. Enjoying the scenery is similar.
