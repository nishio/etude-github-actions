the theory that old people are always old from the start
>The reason why [old people] are appearing in large numbers, perhaps "it is not that they have become old because they are old, but young people who had the qualities of old people to begin with, and who, in their youth, had dissipated their desires through 'food, exercise, sex, travel, and drinking parties,' but when they got old, all these disappeared at once, and all that was left was vanity, pride, and power-hungry. This theory is very strong in my mind.
