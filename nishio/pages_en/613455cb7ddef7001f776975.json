If you put things in the hopper with a dropper at 4 tick intervals, it won't feed.
If you put an item in a hopper with a dropper at 4 tick intervals, that hopper will not send the item out.
　Experimental Video
　　The dropper is connected to a 2-on, 2-off clock circuit that ejects an item to the hopper every 4 ticks.
　　Items do not move to the second and subsequent hoppers while there is an item in the dropper and item ejection continues every 4 ticks.
　　When the dropper runs out of items, it starts moving items in the hopper.

　So if you use a 4-tick to elevate a droppable item and put it directly into the hopper, it will clog up in the hopper section, and you should put a chest between the two.
　　When it clogs, in some cases, the droppers in front of it clog one after the other, and if you're using the type of self-clocking that assumes only one item is in the bottom row, it will stop clogging.
