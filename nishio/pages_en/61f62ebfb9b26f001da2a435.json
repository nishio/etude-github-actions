Winners don't have to explain themselves.
["If you win, you're in the government; if you lose, you're in the rebel army.]

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Please see to it that things work out.

In the public mind, however, the credit for the eventual failure makes people lose their perception of the care that had gone into it. Winners do not need to explain themselves. The public does not pay attention to the details of the measures adopted, but only to the good or bad results. If the objective is achieved, nothing is lost. Good results, no matter how unsatisfactory the means, enrich everything. Therefore, it is part of the art of life to sometimes break the rules of art if one cannot otherwise achieve good results.
