 If the videos are posted like this, even people without a Nico Nico Douga account can watch them. And since the flow of the story is summarized in bullet-point style, even if you don't have time to watch all the videos, you can check the story and watch only the ones you are interested in.
 
 I didn't realize it until I saw this entry. I had been paying attention to the fact that there were 12 presenters at one time and 30 people listening to them on the spot, but in reality there were 200 "people watching via ustream," an order of magnitude more, and probably even more "people watching the videos afterwards. That's what it means to publish a video of a conference, isn't it?
 
 On Lingr (http://www.lingr.com/room/1000speakers), coji wrote, "I think it would be a lot easier if we cut the number of 1000speakers in half." If we do a live broadcast and a recording, it may not make much difference if the number of people present is halved.
 
 But then, the problem is to secure a venue where the network can be used. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lapis25/20080527/1211896046 mentioned that the most difficult part may be to secure a venue where the network can be used. I think the most difficult thing is to secure a venue where the network can be used.
