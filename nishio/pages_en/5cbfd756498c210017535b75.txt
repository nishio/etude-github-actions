Herbert Simon Problem Solving
[The problem is the gap between the ideal and the reality.]

[This is the earliest description of "problem solving" that we know of, which refers to the process of finding and applying tools and methods to reduce a [problem] by considering it as a [difference] between a [goal] and a [current situation]. The original first edition was published in 1960, and was completely revised in 1977 and translated in 1979.

[Herbert Simon], "[The Science of Decision Making]," p. 95.
	>Problem solving proceeds in the form of determining [goals], discovering [differences] ([gaps]) between the [current situation] and the goals ([ideal situation]), and applying tools or processes, either from memory or by exploration, that are appropriate to reduce those specific differences.
		(Grandson's drawing from [Compendium of Problem Solving], p. 54)
	It actually said.
		>Problem solving takes the form of setting goals, discovering differences between the current situation and the goals, discovering tools or processes, either in memory or through search, that are appropriate for reducing those specific differences, and applying those tools or processes.
			Problems are being broken down to create sub-problems.
			If we can break it down to problems we can solve, then the overall goal is achieved.
	I didn't say all problems would be solved this way.
		The following p. 101 contains an explanation of the "[evil structure problem]"
		Given an unfamiliar problem, one must first identify what the problem is
		We have to find the right way to [indicate the problem] before we start solving it.
