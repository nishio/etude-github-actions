 Thoughts.
 　I want to minimize the sum of the differences between pairs of numbers, but only one number X can be changed in M ways
 　M is more than 10^5 so is it hard to try them all?
 　　Good if the sum of the differences can be obtained in constant or logarithmic order
 　Consider the sum of the differences
 　If there is an overlap when the pair is considered as a range, the difference can be much smaller by exchanging [assuming the intervals do not intersect].
 　　Then, the best solution is to greedily pair them from the smallest to the largest.
 　Make cumulative sums paired from the top and paired from the bottom, excluding those that change value.
 　　　Same idea as [cumulative product from left to right
 　　Binary search to find how many X's are in, logarithmic order
 　　Put X in the odd-numbered ones, each of which is a cumulative sum of a constant order
 Official Explanation OK
  There is an option to solve by the shaku-tori method.
