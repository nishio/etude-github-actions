This chat system is not a good way to organize tasks.
â†’ Maybe we can make a version that asks questions to help organize tasks. Joining up with [Motivational Advice

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I want to organize my tasks for tomorrow and beyond, but I also have a feeling that this chat system might not be the best for task organization, and I'm bothered by it, so I want to organize.
What kind of chat system is [nisbot.icon] that?
[nishio.icon]The system has an initial question, then you answer it, find keywords from the answer, and ask questions about it. So it has one root, but task organization has many roots because "there are many tasks that are not necessarily related to each other, and you have to write them down first. The way of asking questions needs to change.
[nisbot.icon]What type of task is that?
[nishio.icon]If it was an urgent and important task, you would have to do it without having to worry about it, so basically it would be "tasks that look important but are not urgent. In terms of task management, they say, "Let's write down everything that's bothering you first," so if you want to do that with this system, the question would be, "Is there anything else that's bothering you?" And then, "Is there anything else that's bothering you?" and keep asking them until they say, "No more"?
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that task?
[nishio.icon]I think it's rather possible if you specialize the way you ask questions to organize tasks, but thinking about it and making it is one of the "tasks that might be good to do but are not urgent"
[nisbot.icon]Where is that task?
[nishio.icon]The task is in the brain, and then it is confusing, so it needs to be written down. This is the same composition. If it's like writing out the task, I think it's better to say what I want to say, ignoring all the questions that don't fit.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that task located?
[nishio.icon]For now, let's look back at the tasks in this week's work log. First of all, when I'm using this, there is a phenomenon that the text field is covered by the keyboard, which is inconvenient. Why does this happen and how can I solve it? I can't see the way to solve this problem, so I'm a bit hesitant, but it's important because it greatly affects the usability of the system.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Ease of use is important. Also, right now, for importing into Regroup, I keep copying and pasting and then hitting the split button, but I end up splitting everything, so I think "one click sends it to the server, and Regroup opens with all the split contents" is fine.

 What does this task look like?
[nishio.icon]I wonder what it is. There is a lack of content stored on the chat server and the problem of extracted keywords not being in chronological order needs to be resolved. When organizing, it is inconvenient that the extracted keywords are not nearby.

 Where does this task come from?
[nishio.icon]Tasks appear as something that bridges the gap between reality and the ideal when you use what you have created. It is often impossible to verbalize what is ideal until we see what we have created.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its a task?
I want to make sure that commands such as "ask first" in [nishio.icon] chat do not become stickies. Before messing with the internals of the chat server, I write test code. What specific tests do you write? I want to be able to take machine learning training data. I want to download data from Firebase. I also want to delete objects that are created by "opened page but did not talk" and so on.

 > Tasks appear as something that bridges the gap between reality and the ideal when you use what you have created. Often we cannot verbalize what is ideal until we see what we have created.
 What do you hope will happen with this task?
[nishio.icon]Tasks are good when they are solved. Since a task is the gap between the ideal and the reality, it will disappear if the ideal changes or if the ideal state is reached. I want to create a user object. What will be stored there? For example, in my case, I write "listening chat system" but every time I write "chat system. It would be nice to remember high-frequency phrases.
[nisbot.icon] What needs to happen to that task?
[nishio.icon]For a task to be resolved, it must be both clear enough and motivating enough to do it. Since none of the tasks are urgent and unenforceable, they can easily be stopped if there are factors that hinder motivation.
[nisbot.icon] Can that task do it?
[nishio.icon] "Tasks that clarify tasks" often need to be done.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that task and all of them?
[nishio.icon]NG
[nisbot.icon]
 > "Tasks to clarify tasks" Often needed.
 Is this task the same as all of them? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]Cutting everything out as keywords is not a good idea.
[nisbot.icon]When all of that happens, what happens to the task?
[nishio.icon]NGKW
[nisbot.icon]What type of NGKW is that?
[nishio.icon]Mm, this behavior is a bug.
[nisbot.icon]What type of bug is that?
[nishio.icon] That's supposed to be a command, so it's not supposed to be a keyword.
[nisbot.icon]What type of keywords are those?
[nishio.icon] Continuing with the task export, "There is a bug where the command becomes a keyword, I'll look into it and fix it."
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that keyword?
As for the [nishio.icon] chat web client, I would like to be able to send commands. Up until now, since it was a chatbot, we had to send commands as strings, but I think it would be nice to be able to use buttons to give feedback to the keywords picked just before, like "don't dig into that," or "all of that," as I said earlier.
[nisbot.icon]What type of command is that?
[nishio.icon] "It's time to finish" or "You're getting too far away from what you wanted in the first place" could also be commands.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that command?
I need a page explaining how to use the [nishio.icon] command, including an explanation of how to use it. But I am also inclined to wait until I can get the logs properly.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that command?
[nishio.icon] I think the "Kikidashi Chat System" page is an appropriate place to put the explanation. The page is a bit cluttered at the moment, so it should be moved to a separate page.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that chat system?
[nishio.icon]Well, I don't think it's a good idea to use it this way, because it's like "I'm writing out a task, and someone interrupts me from the side, and sometimes it distracts me from the task.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I need a page explaining how to use it, including an explanation of the commands. But I'm also inclined to wait until I can get a proper log.
 Where is this command located?
[nishio.icon]After all, this current system is tied to a form of delving into a single topic!
[nisbot.icon]
 > I need a page explaining how to use it, including an explanation of the commands. But I'm also inclined to wait until I can get a proper log.
 What does this command look like?
[nishio.icon]I'll make a Kanban tomorrow at Github Project and see if I can get it in there...
[nisbot.icon]
 > I need a page explaining how to use it, including an explanation of the commands. But I'm also inclined to wait until I can get a proper log.
 Where does this command come from?
[nishio.icon] I noticed when I tried to export this to Scrapbox, I didn't deploy it and the icon change is not yet implemented.

 How do you know this command?
