Do you write in your personal project before you write in your shared project?
2021-07-18
I think I'll create myself in my personal project before I write to [/villagepump/well].
 [Originality first before co-creation] is a story about "recruiting people to work together without knowing what you are going to create" [nishio.ikon].
 　On the other hand, what's being discussed on this page is about "verbalizing thoughts that have not yet been clearly verbalized."
  　These two are different.
 　When writing the language, do you write for a one-person project or a multi-person project?
 　　A feeling that it doesn't matter either way [nishio.icon].
 　　 I feel that "it should be done as a one-person project" is not a good idea because it adds unnecessary restrictions to the output.
 　　Even in [nishio.icon], which is mainly used for one-person projects, there is often a pattern of "write on Facebook and then reprint" or "write on Twitter and then reprint" if you observe carefully
 　　　I wonder at what point they do that. I'll give it some thought.
  　　　Do you do this when you don't have some coherent amount of text in you, and you want the feeling of sending it in segments?
  　　　　Unlike stationery like Scrapbox, where you can rewrite freely anytime you want, by using stationery that "cannot be changed after writing and sending (or can be changed, but it's a bit of a hassle)", are you forcing output by preventing "over-editing"?
  　　　I don't think I'm looking for that much of a response from others.
  　　　Used when you have enough to write about to be able to post a series of tweets.
  　　　　When you don't even have that.
  　　　　　I need to organize my thoughts on what to do with ~..."
  　　　　　I use [Keicho] in these situations.
