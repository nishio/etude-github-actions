Like this one. I think it sounds like an interesting thing to say, so I'm writing it up in Scrapbox and doing some bracketing...

It is a challenge for the recipient to catch up due to lack of knowledge, and it is a loss to slow down for an unspecified recipient (this is not the case if you want a specific person to understand the message).
