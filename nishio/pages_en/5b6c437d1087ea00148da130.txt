　[nishio.icon]Highly recommended, near mandatory if you want to edit Scrapbox from iPhone.
　　Android people are sad.
　　I would be very annoyed if Porter was no longer available.
　　If it weren't for Porter, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be using Scrapbox as much as I do now.
　the right moment
　　Copy and paste is on the button, so it's one touch.
　　　When you want to delete a long line, you can easily do it by cutting without selection.
　　Take a picture with the iPhone camera, crop, upload, and the flow is smooth.
　　One-touch outline editing (up/down bullet points, nest depth change)
　　It's easy to write links because it's one-touch to enter square brackets and put the cursor between them.
　　　Double-tap to select a word, which can then be made into a link with a single tap.
　　　You can zoom in and out of a selection with a single thumb stroke.
　　　Ease of writing links is a fairly important aspect of Scrapbox usability
