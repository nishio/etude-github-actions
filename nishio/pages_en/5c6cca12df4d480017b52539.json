Abuse of Logical Thinking
[Logical thinking] has been abused in some cases.

The naive belief that one can be [grounded] by logic is false and
 Unclear if the axiom is correct.
 [infinite regress].
(lessening the significance or value of the previous word) the likes of
[Munchausen's trilemma]

This can be used maliciously to [sabotage] a project that you want to delay.

I can then exercise discretion that is not based on logic to produce results and bring it into the logic of "[proving competence through results]". [Pragmatism].

I thought these simple and harmful strategies would be easy to stop, but I'm surprised that people don't understand these [relativism of correctness] stories or are emotionally repulsed by them for some reason!

We are merely talking about such a system, dynamics....
