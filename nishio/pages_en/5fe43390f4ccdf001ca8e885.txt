RangeAdd is two PointAdd
[Range Add Point Read] can be realized with two Point Add and Range Sum using an ordinary [Segment Tree].
　If reads are in order from the top, you don't need to use a segment tree, just an array.
　If the range of values is 10^9 or something like that, it's difficult to use an array. You can use a dictionary. see [ABC188].


　with the difference between adjacent items, not the target array itself.
　　Inverse Conversion of [Cumulative Sum
　　I wish this concept had a name, I saw you call it [incremental list].
　Range Add is Point Add with start and end
　	code::
　		def RangeAdd(start, end, value):
　			PointAdd(start, value)
　			PointAdd(end, -value)
　Point Read is the sum up to and including that position
　	code::
　	 def PointRead(pos):
　	 	RangeSum(0, pos + 1)
