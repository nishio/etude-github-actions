次元削減注意
It was titled "[Memory and Abstraction]" from 2018-10-22 to 2019-11-10, but I renamed it because I cannot recall this title when referring to it from various places, so I decided it was not an appropriate name. Note the dimensionality reduction since we are talking about putting [dimensionality reduction] in [attention mechanism].  #memory #abstraction

	Multiply both query and key by the same [Dropout] when pulling from [Memory] in [Attention Mechanism].
 This is essentially equivalent to comparing the two after [dimensionality reduction
	[The similarity of concepts is not the distance between them" as explained in [Comparison by reducing the dimension] and "Distance is the similarity after collapsing on various axes" can be realized.
	[Recall from [Memory] with abstraction rather than simple similarity between query and key.
 I mean, this is the equivalent of [analogy] or [association].
