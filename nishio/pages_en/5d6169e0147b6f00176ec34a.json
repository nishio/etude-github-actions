Not "no," but "can't find."
Not "no," but "[I can't find]."

Phrases I'm careful to use.
When writing on social networking sites, etc., write "(I) can't find X" instead of "I don't have X".
	For "there is no X" to be true, I must be omniscient, but of course I am not omniscient.
	The act of writing "no X" when "no X" could be incorrect is dishonest.
	Harmful if you write "there is no X" and there is in fact an X, because it undermines the "[power to be]" of others

If someone knows that there is an X
	See "No X."
		I'll just assume you're an idiot and go through with it.
		They're angry that I spread incorrect information and they're going to correct me.
	See "I Can't Find X."
		I'll just assume you're an idiot and go through with it.
		I'm going to tell you and I'm going to give you some information.
	The odds of getting information either way aren't much different, and the "no X" side increases the likelihood that the other side is angry.
		No." "No!" "No!" I'm sorry." "I can't find it." "Here it is." "Thank you!" The latter is better for your mental health.
