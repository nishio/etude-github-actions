Aggregate difficult to divide
[https://gyazo.com/074de177bd8d8dc1505ae0505e41e18b]
　When you want to divide the elements of a set by type and then perform an aggregate f on them, but the cost of the division is high
　If f is a function that can be realized by repeated binary operations
　　Examples: sum, min
　Aggregation can be done without dividing the data in advance

 code:python
  for x in S:
      subgroup[typeof(x)].append(x)
  for t, xs in subgroup:
      result[t] = f(xs)

	code:python
	 for x in S:
	     result[typeof(x)].update(x)
