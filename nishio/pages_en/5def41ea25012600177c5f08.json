copy and paste
Select it and "Copy" will appear in the balloon menu.
　It is the selected object that is copied
　The object must not be affected by any edits made to it before pasting.
　As for copying stickies, I think it would be better to have a link to the reference source, but I reserve the right to do so.
　Implemented [pRegroup-done-2020].
　Paste adds it in the exact same position as you copied it, so you can say "Huh? Where?" you might say, "Where?

	I implemented [I want to use around interesting things out of what the test user entered], and it was just a step away from copy/paste behavior.
	Just add a copy to the [balloon menu].
	How do you menu the paste?
	After pasting, position and scale must be properly adjusted

	Copy and paste should be able to go into the clipboard and paste into other windows.
