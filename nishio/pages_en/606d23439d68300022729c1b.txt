be a matter of luck
When a lottery win is [luck], there is a difference between "it's luck" said by people who buy lottery tickets as a matter of course and "it's luck" by people who don't buy lottery tickets. They are waiting, thinking that "if I'm lucky, a lot of money will roll in," without buying a lottery ticket, but it doesn't roll in. They assume it is because they are [unlucky].
Lottery tickets have a negative expected value, but there are many lotteries in the world with a positive expected value. People who know that it has a positive expected value naturally buy it, and if they assume that they will buy it, they can only say, "Whether I win or not is just luck. On the other hand, there are people who do not buy lotteries.
