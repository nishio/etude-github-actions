No one is equal to the market.
The [market] is a group of people, all of whom have different [values] and [financial] sensibilities. No one can accurately predict the movements of the market. It is necessary to [distinguish] between oneself and the market.

Such a product [would never sell]" means, "I wouldn't buy it even if it were cheap." And I don't know the difference between myself and the market".

This product [will definitely sell]" means "I will buy it if it is cheap. And I don't know the difference between myself and the market.

The [creator] should be especially careful.
Even if the creator thinks, "This is a good product and should sell well," it does not necessarily mean that the market will think it is a good product.
Even if the creator thinks, "This kind of product will not sell," it may sell surprisingly well.
　By assuming on their own that the product will not sell and avoiding testing the market, they lose the opportunity to correct their assumptions.
