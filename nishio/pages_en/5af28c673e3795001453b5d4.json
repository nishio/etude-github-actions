Leverage memo management
>I sometimes "come up with" a book that I read at speed reading as my thoughts, rather than "understanding" it.
> I was wondering how to record the source of the information in the leverage memo, but it might be better to record it only in the first memo so that it is easy to look it up later, and then delete it for the rest of the memos.

 Seems hard to understand without a little word supplementation.
 Managing [leveraged notes] is supposed to be a "first note" that you read and extracted from a book and then repeatedly read and repeatedly condensed.
 As the data is gradually compressed, the percentage of source information becomes larger and larger.
 Talk about making the first memo searchable, so the secondary leverage memo doesn't need a source.

	By searching from the searchable information stock regarding what you have in mind, you will find that "in the past ~ also claimed this".
 If this process goes around properly, there is no need for the human mind to memorize bibliographic information.

	At the time of writing this, I still don't know [Incremental Reading].
