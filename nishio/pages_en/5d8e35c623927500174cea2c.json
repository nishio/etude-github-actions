			Japan, the U.S., and Lebanon are the only countries where the percentage of people who say "the U.S." has increased between 2008 and 2017 when asked "Which country is driving the global economy today?", and both the amount of increase and the percentage itself are greater in Japan than in the U.S. Japan believes that "the U.S. is leading the way" more than the U.S.
			In the original data, Japan has the largest incremental increase in the percentage of respondents who believe that the U.S. is leading, and the smallest incremental increase in the percentage of respondents who believe that China is leading (Japan is the only country that has not increased).
			>The situation in Japan is also quite unique, with 61% of respondents citing the "United States" as the driving force of the global economy, while only 19% of respondents cite "China. This extreme contrast even exceeds that of the U.S. The only countries with a similar structure are India, Vietnam, and other countries that are troubled by China's expansionist behavior. Japan's image of China is quite unique in the eyes of the world, and few countries share it.
   > Next, let us clarify the change in each country's response to the question, "Which countries are driving the global economy today? The countries above the 45-degree line in Chart 7 indicate that their recognition as a driving force has increased compared to 2008. Of the 18 countries that can be compared with 2008, only three (Japan, the U.S., and Lebanon) saw an increase in the number of responses for the "U.S." compared to 2008. On the other hand, "China" increased in all countries except Japan, with Australia, Spain, Poland, and the U.K. all increasing by more than 20% points.
			In other words, if you think of yourself as having an attitude toward China similar to the average in Japan, that is a rather extreme attitude in the rest of the world.
