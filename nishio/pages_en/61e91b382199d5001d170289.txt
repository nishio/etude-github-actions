Reading with hands
In Japanese: [read while moving hands]. Direct translation: Read while moving hands

What I want to describe: 

	While reading books
	 not only by chasing a sentence with eyes
	 but also by using hands
	 concrete examples:
	 	by typing the source code,
	  by taking notes of things that you thought important,
	  by developing mathematical expressions.

	suggestion from a reviewer: "[to learn by writing]"
		It is not restricted to "writing", but it looks better than "with hands"
