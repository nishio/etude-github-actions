 *1356861151*I bought an extended battery that can charge my 3DS.
 My wife said "I want to play 3DS on the bullet train to Osaka" and bought this thing. Oh, it displays the remaining % of battery life digitally? Yes, the one I used to have to charge my iPhone had no visible battery level, and I had trouble knowing whether I should charge it or not. It's steadily evolving!

 The output is MicroUSB, so they use this to convert it to 3DS: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B009D7YMP0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishioyome-22& linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B009D7YMP0">KASHIMURA Charging conversion adapter microUSB to 3DS/DSi AJ-353</a
 
 He said that he had bought it because it worked well, although some devices did not charge properly when a conversion adapter was inserted. It seems that he got a good clerk.
