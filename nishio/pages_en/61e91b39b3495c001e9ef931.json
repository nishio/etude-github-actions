Fig: Learning process is a repetition of three phases: [information gathering], [modeling], [verification]

	[concrete] = [concrete] phase
		[information gathering] = [information gathering].
		[experience] = [experience].
	[abstract] = [abstract] phase
		[abstraction] = [abstraction].
		[modeling] = [modeling]
		[pattern discovery] = [pattern discovery]
