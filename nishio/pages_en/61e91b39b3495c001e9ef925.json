(0.3) Structure of this book
Chapter 1 is "to learn something new." Just remembering the answer not allow you to adapt to the situation. To acquire the ability to adjust knowledge, you need to turn the 3-phase cycle of information gathering, abstraction, and practice. In this chapter, I delve into each phase in detail.

To turn the cycle of learning, "[motivation]" is necessary as fuel. Chapter 2 is "to motivate." In this chapter, I explain how to maintain a highly motivated state based on data of those who do not motivate more than 12,000 people.

You want to remember what you have learned. In Chapter 3 "To train memory," I explain the mechanism of the brain, the experimental results on how to learn, and how to efficiently fix the memories enabled by software.

Have you bought many books that you havenâ€™t read yet? Or do you have vast amount of reading to do? Chapter 4 "Reading Efficiently" explains how to improve the input efficiency of information by comparing fast reading methods and slow reading methods.

Chapter 5 "To summarize ideas" is about output. It is easy to think that "learning = input," but it is necessary to verify learning by outputting. However, as the amount of knowledge increases with many inputs, it makes you feel difficult for organizing it and telling it to people. 
Since we can't copy the knowledge in the brain entirely to other people, it is necessary to cut out, bundle, rearrange the knowledge network in the brain, and convert it into words and diagrams. In this chapter, I explain the KJ method of Jiro Kawakita and my writing method as a method to put many inputs in a form that can be output to others.

I think many people think that intellectual production techniques are a way to come up with new ideas. I believe there are commonalities among following three activities:

	to come up with ideas
	to deepen understanding
	to find patterns. 

Chapter 6 is "To come up with ideas."

I want to talk about various other things, but the number of pages is limited. In chapters 1 to 6, I explain "how to learn" on the assumption that "what to learn" is decided. However, I think "what to learn" is more important than "how to learn." In Chapter 7 "To decide what to learn," I explain about decision-making strategy.
