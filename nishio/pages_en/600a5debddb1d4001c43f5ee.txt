Written
　Story 1
 　The purpose of the Regroup is to help people who are bewildered by not being able to put into words what they want to say, and to help them through the process of writing output.
 　The output text must be understandable by others.
 　However, sticky notes are material for thought.
 　So the stickies and their spatial arrangement need not be visible and understandable to others, nor do they need to be able to reproduce the original text.
 　It is important that the sticky note be movable. Therefore, conjunctions and directives should be removed. This is because they are difficult to move.
 Story 2
  Sticky notes and spatial arrangements are temporal for text creation and can be discarded after the text is created.
  It is a distant ideal, but we think it would be good to be able to reuse these sticky notes.
  For example, physical stickies cannot be searched, but electronic stickies can.
  I am also thinking that instead of doing an explicit search, it might be helpful to suggest relevant or this sticky while working on a text using Regroup to help with the text creation process.
  (This search and suggestion is not a personal priority and has not been implemented.)
