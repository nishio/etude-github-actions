 *1210105411*Missing rice
 A 2 kilogram bag of rice is hidden somewhere. I want to cook rice, but I can't find it.
 
 *1210120650*Seal
 I was told to put it up, but it's kind of tacky.

 I don't put it up, I just put it on top. I don't have the courage to put it up.
 
 *1210122330* hmmm
 
 I am not feeling well. Mainly in a mental sense. I have a stomachache.

 >|cpp|
 template <class T> : public binary_function<T, T, T>
 struct plus {
   T operator()(const T& i, const T& j) const {
     return i + j; 
   }
 };

 I don't understand the grammar...

 >|cpp|
 template <class _Tp>
 struct plus : public binary_function<_Tp,_Tp,_Tp> {
   _Tp operator()(const _Tp& __x, const _Tp& __y) const { return __x + __y; }
 };
 ||<
 
 I understand this. I inherit the structure called binary_function written below and define the () operator so that when it is called, it returns the result of the addition.
 
 >|cpp|
 template <class _Arg1, class _Arg2, class _Result>
 struct binary_function {
   typedef _Arg1 first_argument_type;
   typedef _Arg2 second_argument_type;
   typedef _Result result_type;
 };
 ||<
 
 In Python, if you define a () operator, you define a __call__ method. Even if you do not need a receiver, you must create an instance.
 
 >|python|
 >>> class Fanctor(object):
 	def __call__(self, x, y):
 		return x + y
 
 	
 >>> add = Fanctor()
 >>> add(1, 2)

 C++ may be a more natural way to create functors.
 
 *1210142562* How do you put the [AS2] button...
 I tried to make something with AS2, but first of all, I have no idea how to put a button on it.
 >>
 To create a button using ActionScript :.
    Drag the Button component from the Components panel to the current document's library.
 <<
 
 ...maybe there's a way to put a button with just ActionScript?

 What we tried
 
 >>
 _root.createClassObject(mx.controls.Button, "my_button", 10, {label:"Click me"});
 <<
 I get pissed off that there is no mx.controls.Button.
 
 >>
 	_root.createClassObject(flash.display.SimpleButton, "btn", 10, {label:"FINISH"});
 	_root.btn.move(280, 200);
 <<
 
 I get pissed off that there is no flash.display.SimpleButton.
 
 >>
 	_root.createClassObject(Button, "btn", 10, {label:"FINISH"});
 	_root.btn.move(280, 200);
 <<
 
 No errors, but nothing.
 
 
 >>
 	_root.createClassObject(SimpleButton, "btn", 10, {label:"FINISH"});
 	_root.btn.move(280, 200);
 <<
 
 I get angry that there is no SimpleButton.
 
 *1210153600*1000speakers is looking for speakers~!
 http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:5
 The call for speakers has not been filled yet because it was in the middle of a consecutive holiday weekend. I was too tired to go to Mt. Takao and went home and went to bed immediately.
 
 The next keynote speaker will be Xaky from iKnow. I wondered if he could speak Japanese well, but he was better than most Japanese. If I were to compete with 100 high school girls in Shibuya to see who could correctly write ruby in Taisho era sentences, I think I would win hands down.
 
 *1210167421*[AS3]Mystery
 When I create an instance of another class ButtonPane in the main Client class, pass this to its setup method, and then addEventListener to this in that method, for some reason it appears to be ButtonPane and not the main class, which is puzzling. I encountered a puzzling bug. I'm sure I'm already tired today, so I'll continue tomorrow.
 
 >|actionscript3|
 package {
 ...
   public class Client extends Sprite {
 ...
     public function Client() {
 ...
       var b:ButtonPane = new ButtonPane();
       b.setup(this);
     }
 ...
   }
 }
 
 ...
 class ButtonPane extends Sprite{
 ...  
   public function setup(target:Sprite):void{
 ...
     target.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OVER, mouseOver);
     target.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT, mouseOut);
     target.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, mouseOver);
     target.addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, run);
     target.addChild(this);
 ...
   }

 -The NeoCube beats Rubik's Cube in that there is no right answer (video) : Gizmodo Japan, a blog full of gadget information.

 Woo hoo, this is good! But it's not that rare as an object, it's available in Japan. So I sent an email to "Permanent Magnet Magna" requesting a quote. If it's a joint purchase and it's cheaper, I think I'll solicit it. I'll post a follow-up report on my blog either way.

 *1210176363*Earthquake
 I was going to go to bed, but the shaking, which was louder than usual, continued for quite a long time, so I went online to assess the current situation.

 I'm sleepy, but I can't sleep! Gee!

 <body>_root.createClassObject(mx.controls.Button, "my_button", 10, {label: "Click me" });<br>You can do this, but there are two points. <br>1. the classpath must be passed to the source of the mx component<br>2. the button component must be added to the library (Export to ActionScript must be checked in the linkage)<br><br>A plain button not an mx component I don't think there is any way to create the symbol using only AS2. </body>
