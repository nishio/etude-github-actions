society
In Japanese, a person who graduated the university called [shakaijin].
[However `society person` does not seem natural English.
The word [working adult] was used in [(1.2.1.2) How much time can you spend for learning?

Replacement candidate:

	person who graduate university
		(feel incompatible) Even if a 30-year-old person did not graduate university, he may be [a working person].
	if you have a full time job
		(feel incompatible) Even if a 30-year-old person does not have a job, he may be [a working person].

Is it similar to the concept of "[adult]?"

I used same word in [(5.3) Tuning for busy people], but in this case it just means busy people.
