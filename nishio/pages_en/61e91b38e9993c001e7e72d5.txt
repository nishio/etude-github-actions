(1.3.1) Learn from what you want to know
Let's start from what you want to know. Your [curiosity] enhances "[motivation]" and boosts the learning cycle. For example, if you read [(1.1.2) Modeling and abstraction] and want to know the difference between [list]s and [tuple]s in Python, you can look for explanations about it and read them. It is the approach: "[start from what you want to know]."

If you have some concrete thing which you want to make, it is a chance. If you start moving your hands, you find what you want to know a lot. By gradually eliminating it, you can learn while maintaining high motivation.
