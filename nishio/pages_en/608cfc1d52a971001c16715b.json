Talk to someone who's never done it before about what you want to do and they'll tell you why you can't do it.
>All the adults who teach these things (reasons why they can't be done) are "people who have never done it before," who have never built an airplane or a rocket, and they were just saying random things. If you talk to "people who have never done it before" about what you "want to do," they will just tell you "why you can't do it," so this is just asking the wrong person to talk to.
