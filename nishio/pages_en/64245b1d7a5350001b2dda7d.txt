Observations and Reflections of a Genius
I think the term "[genius]" is [ambiguous] to begin with.
　It's a term often used by [ordinary people] to maintain [self-esteem] by [labeling] [isolating] [them] as [something] "that's [different]."
　　Well, it's better than them coming to kill me.
　　　relevance
　　　　[ordinary man killing genius]
　　　　[attacks unfamiliar objects without looking at them properly].

I sense "[a certain smartness]."
　What is this "certain cleverness"?
　　The fact that you want to preface it with "sort of" means that it's a different concept than the default "[cleverness]"

The [cycle of learning] of an engineer's intellectual production
	[[Learning Cycle.icon]]
Normal learning process
　1: Collect information and arrange it at the bottom
　2: Think about it and pile it up on the top step.
　3: Apply and learn from the results
　　The [Learning Cycle (old)] is more well written.
　　[I'm suspicious of anything that looks neatly put together].
 Some people see study as classroom learning and overlook the importance of 3

That genius is spinning the learning cycle at high speed, or is it?
　Well, you could say that and you could say that they don't.
　I get the feeling that you're jumping to the easy explanation that "the learning is greater because we're running the learning cycle at a higher speed."
　That doesn't explain the existence of a "certain kind" of "cleverness."

Learning by turning the cycle of learning is the high road.
　I feel we're taking the not-so-high road.
