How to take the load undetermined task
After observing the behavior patterns of various people for a long time, I think there are two patterns of behavior when there are multiple tasks for which the [load] cannot be accurately estimated in advance.
 One pattern is to estimate the workload on the high side and try not to overflow. If you already have two uncertain tasks and think there is a possibility of overflow, you do not touch the third one. Filtering in advance.
 The other pattern is to estimate the workload at the low end and get to everything. And if there is an overflow, filter it [after the fact] by doing the highest priority ones.

Each may have an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation.
 When doing a task where success = low probability of high load occurrence, it seems more advantageous to sow seeds without fear of overflow. #Sowing seeds
 If there's a disadvantage, it's when there's a deadline that can't be moved, or when there are other people's tasks that depend on it.
  I wrote that when others are involved... but that's a problem because communication with others is falling behind as a task priority, and it would be better if we communicate with them early on to delay or cancel.
