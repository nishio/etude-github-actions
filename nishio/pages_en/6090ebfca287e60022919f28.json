 *1233206491*Housekeeping
 - Transfer (by 15:00)
 -- Oh, I have less left over than I thought, less than a month's rent. I'll have to check to see when my next rent check is due -- just got it on 1/27, I think. I guess the next one will be around 2/24.
 - What about cancelling the old house?
 -- A postcard called "Cancellation Request Form" was included in my renewal paperwork.
 -- 30 days before 2/28, could it be today? If I don't get it out today, will there be a penalty?
 -- I can't find the contract so I don't know who the management company is.
 -- Where's the Hanko?
 --- It's not good to leave a hanseko in a handbag.
 -- Go to the Apamanshop in front of the station (where I signed the contract). They say they can't accept it here (different from Apamanshop Leasing).
 -- The cancellation date should be 2/28 when the contract expires. They say the same day to check or do anything else is also fine.
 -- If the mail is attached to the headquarters by tomorrow, it is OK, so I went to a large post office to make sure it will be there by tomorrow and submitted it.
 -- ■ done
 - Purchase juice for breakfast
 - Logged into Remember The Milk for the first time in a while; I'm going to have to check my account about 2/24 and if it's less than my rent, I'm going to have to get a reminder email thrown at me because it's hard to remember that I have to move the money from the post office to go.
 -- The task of "wash and dry" repeated every three days has been accumulating since October 23. It's hard to delete them.
 -- The selection of the item is i. I memorized it.
 -- ■ Registered
 -- I register repeating tasks and get annoyed when reminders are sent daily. I had to turn off reminders. This makes no sense, so let's limit the number of tasks to the minimum number of "things that are still a long way off but need a reminder that I can't forget". I mean, fundamentally, it is strange that I can only set whether or not to send a reminder and when to send a reminder, not by task, but by the whole batch.
 
 
 I thought it was inconvenient that "delete", "delay", and "delegate" in GTD all start with "d", but in RTM, it's "postpone", not "delay". I can distinguish between [p] and [d] if I use [-] for delete.
