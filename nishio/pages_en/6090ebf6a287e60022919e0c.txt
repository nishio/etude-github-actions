 *1206329690*Sleeper
 
 Mwah, two in a row.
 
 *1206334996* Thoughts on the Future of 1000 Speaker Conferences
 - It is still against the "free conference" policy to charge 1500 yen at the venue and order pizza. What should we do?
 - Is timekeeping still necessary?
 -- If everyone is done in 15 minutes, including questions and transitions, I'm fine with a get-together without food for two hours because it ends at 5:00, but if we push it, I'm hungry.
 - How to create a branch
 - How can we hold a joint meeting with the Ambition Group?
 
 *1206349055*trial and error
 Instead of saying "try and err" or "hit and away", I think you should say "trial and error" since you are Japanese.
 
 *1206350886*Umbrella
 I don't have an umbrella in my bag, at home, or in the lab, but I don't think it's dwango. But it wasn't raining during the 1000 speakers conference, was it?
 
 *1206353323*[Python]I want to hook input to a tty.
 I know how to use the termios module to not wait until a newline is pressed.
 
 - <a href="http://www.python.jp/doc/current/lib/module-termios.html">8.8 termios -- POSIX-style terminal control</a>
 - <a href="http://www.fireproject.jp/feature/c-language/term/termios.html">termios</a>
 
 But Python is not receiving any input. What am I supposed to do, open bash with a pipe and tap all the input Python receives into it?
 
 -----
 At first I tried the code below. There is no echo, but what I typed is being transmitted to bash.
 Now I just need to set it up to echo or something using termios.
 
 >|python|
 import subprocess
 import sys
 p = subprocess.Popen(
     "bash", 
     stdin=sys.stdin,
     stdout=sys.stdout,
     stderr=sys.stderr)

 *1206387450* Insomnia
 Ah.
 I had a bit of a shocking <del>pink</del> moment and insomnia.
 I'll do my best not to oversleep tomorrow.
 Ho-ho-ho.

 <body>Trial and Error gives the impression of 'being troubled,' but Trial and Error has a stronger sense of 'trying first,' so I used that one. <BR>But trial and error is 'trial', isn't it? If I had done that from the beginning, I wouldn't have made the mistake of being hit and error...</body>.

 <BODY>I took the pizza portion to be a post-conference get-together, even though it was at the same venue. I thought that would not violate the "free conference" policy. </body>

 <body>Hmmm, I guess that's the way it's supposed to be, but it's hard to say "I won't participate" even if you don't actually want to pay for it at that place. </body><body>
