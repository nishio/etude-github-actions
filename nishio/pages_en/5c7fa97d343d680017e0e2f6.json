McClelland's theory of desire
	[Motivation theory] proposed by [McClelland].
	Theory that there are three types of needs: [need for achievement], [need for power], and [need for affinity].
	 Later [avoidance desire] was added and it became [four desires
　Nishio feels that this method of thinking in terms of the four needs of [need for achievement], [need for power], [need for affinity], and [need for avoidance] is very useful.
　　[Maslow's stages of need theory] also classified human needs into several categories.
　　　I figured that was the hierarchy.
　　　This implicitly assumes that all humans have the same hierarchy of needs.
　　　Also, when we see people with different expressed desires, we end up with an interpretation that puts a higher/lower level of achievement on people, saying that some people have a higher/lower level of desire achievement.
　　On the flip side, McClelland's is not hierarchical in its four desires.
　　　The [diversity] in the desires of different people is naturally expressed.

		I want to [control].
 desire for affinity
		I want to make [friendships] with others.
		I want to be [liked] by others.
	desire to avoid
