Bounding box to determine the pertinence of groups containing only paths
　The yellow square in the background of the pass was no longer displayed, so that the pass was judged only on the pass.
　This is hard to grasp.
　As with the original sticky, I made it a hit-and-run decision for the box.
　Possibly unnatural in case of long diagonals, etc.
　There is a proposal to make the line thicker to make it a hit.
