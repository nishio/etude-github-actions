 I threw it away.
 -- Expired groceries
 -- Dirty, unworn Tupperware
 -- Cutting board that did not come clean after bleaching
 -- etc.
 
 TODO
 - The stuff in the fridge. I'd like to say I'll throw them out on the day of burnable garbage... but I can't do it before the end of the year. Let's throw them out next year.
 
 *1261848711*[Kaizen] Improving the layout of the kitchen area.
 - Toothbrush, interdental brush, toothpaste, etc. were in the screen cabinet above the kitchen.
 - There was no place to dry the dishes after washing them.
 - Move toothbrush to bathroom sink.
 - Converted a screen shelf into a space for drying dishes.
 
 I decided where the toothbrushes would be placed and went and collected them, and there were six more of these. When I collected them, I found 12 pairs of socks and dozens of washcloths, and anyway, there were too many luxuries.
