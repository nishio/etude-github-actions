You don't see people as individuals.
Maybe they don't think of human beings as "individual entities," but rather as "a superposition of various [characteristics].
When person X who is different from me is being criticized, I think, "No, but I have the same traits that person has.
I don't feel like, "It's another person, so it doesn't matter."
[people's identification] may be strong.

Lancaster's [Characteristics Space] is an argument for goods, but it may be equally recognizable for people.
