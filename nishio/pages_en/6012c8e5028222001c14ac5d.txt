Ray receivers and ejectors
 	In the meantime, I made a ray receiver and ejector.
  　So you can make a sail out of iron, copper, stone, graphene, and eject it?
  　As long as we can pull graphene, we'll be fine away from our home base.
  　Copper is only 0.8M on the current star and 2M on the other stars combined.
 　I went to the trouble of building an ejector, but I hadn't observed it, so I put it down.

 　　　I see, you're going to eject it facing the right angle to put it in orbit.
