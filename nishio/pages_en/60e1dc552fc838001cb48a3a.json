Work so much that you want to concentrate in a situation so relaxing that you can sleep.
>My biggest [productivity] contraption is to work on the couch or in bed during the day. In other words, I put myself in a situation where I can sleep at any time, and I don't spend energy (or sloth, w/e) on time that I don't have to do anything.
> It means only doing enough work that you want to [concentrate] in a situation where you are [relaxed] enough to sleep.
