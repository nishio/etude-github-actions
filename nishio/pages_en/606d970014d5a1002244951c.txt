I hope it gives readers an idea of what the empathic writing mode I created today looks like.

[nisbot.icon]Q1: What do you hope will come of the writing?
I hope [nishio.icon]readers get a sense of what the empathic writing mode we created today is all about.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "empathic writing mode" is that?
[nishio.icon] They ask questions specific to writing assistance.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "text" is that "text"?
[nishio.icon]Well, maybe a blog post.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "blog" is that "blog"?
[nishio.icon]Not a memorandum, but a type of article that tells the reader something and elicits action.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "article" is that "article"?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q2: Imagine someone who is excited to read that sentence. What would that person say?
[nishio.icon]I think it's a great way for people who are not very good at writing to say, "Whoa, this is going to make writing easier than it's ever been." they say.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "text"?
[nishio.icon]Some people who are not good at it have the image of writing from the beginning on a blank piece of manuscript paper, but I don't think so. I think the royal road is to make parts and then rearrange them to compose sentences.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "blank slate" is that "blank slate"?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q3: How positive does he/she feel?
[nishio.icon]It's like, let's actually try it out.
[nisbot.icon]What "actual" is that "actual"?
[nishio.icon]Feel free to activate this chat system as soon as possible.
[nisbot.icon]What is that "feeling" like?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q4: After such a positive feeling, what action should you expect the person to take?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice if you could actually try it, get a success story that you got a sentence out of it, and then spread the word that it was good to use it, and it would be even better if you could give feedback on improvements.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "actual"?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q5: What words would you say to that person to help them feel that positive?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, "Let's actually do it!" I wonder if I'll be motivated by that. The person who created it is just now trying it out for the first time, so he or she may not be so motivated. If I use it for a while and say, "I wrote that sentence and this sentence using this," will they be motivated? Oh, in that sense, I wrote the preface of "The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production" using empathic writing.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "empathic writing" is that?
[nishio.icon]I'm working on it right now, answering 10 questions and then rearranging them to create a sentence. I think the interesting point is that some of the questions focus on the reader's emotions.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "reader" is that "reader"?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q6: If you had a negative feeling, the exact opposite of the positive feeling you answered in Q3, how would you feel?
[nishio.icon] "Well, how can I learn to write with this stuff?" or "How can I learn to write with this stuff?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "eh, there's no way I can learn to write using this stuff" is that "eh, there's no way I can learn to write using this stuff"?
[nishio.icon]Emotions that when you see some new tool, before you try it, you decide that this tool won't work anyway.
[nisbot.icon]What "emotion" is that "emotion"?
[nishio.icon]Learned helplessness?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "learned helplessness" is that?
[nishio.icon]Giving up on the idea that I can't do it anyway
[nisbot.icon]
 > The feeling that when you see some new tool, before you try it, you assume that this tool won't work anyway.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "emotion"?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q7: Imagine a person with that negative feeling. What would that person say?
[nishio.icon]Oh, I answered the line first. A person with that kind of sentiment says, "I'm useless anyway."
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "use is that "use anyway"?
[nishio.icon]The usefulness of a tool is that it can be used to create value after one has mastered its use, but there are often people who expect to suddenly gain value without having to pay the cost of learning to use it, and these people often say they can't try a tool and move on to another. They move on to other tools because they say they can't try them, and in the end, they don't learn any of them, so they don't get value from any of them, which reinforces their belief that they are no good anyway.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "tool" is that "tool"?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q8: Where do these negative feelings come from?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, lack of success experience? I think that if you face and master a tool, even if it is hard, you can feel that there are tools that you can only get value from after you have mastered them. If you don't have that kind of experience, you will repeat actions like copying and pasting code you found by googling.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "tool"?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q9: What would you say to someone with that negative feeling?
[nishio.icon]Well, to be honest, I don't care about such people, or I don't think it's my job to even take care of such people. Parents or elementary schools should do it. Especially since this software is still in the process of being created, it has many more defects than the dead tools in the world, and I think it is a tool that cannot be used without a certain level of competence.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "person" is that "person"?
[nishio.icon]People trapped in learned helplessness.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that "person"?
[nishio.icon]It is difficult to use a tool that is being made by someone who cannot avoid the inadequacy of the tool operationally.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Hmmm, lack of success experience? I think that if you face a tool and learn it well, even if it is hard, you can really feel that there are tools that you can only get value from after you have mastered them. If you don't have that kind of experience, you will repeat actions like copying and pasting code you found by googling.
 What kind of "mastery" is this "mastery"?
[nishio.icon]It's more like a learning curve, or at least a minimum investment before you start creating value. It's like a learning curve to the point where the learning curve is no longer zero.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "proficiency" is that?
[nishio.icon]Next question
[nisbot.icon]Q10: In a word, what is the theme of that sentence?
[nishio.icon]What is it? It was supposed to be an explanation to get people to use it, but from the halfway point, it's starting to look like you're not sure if you want people to use it or not. But, well, I guess I should say that this feature is not a finished product, and not everyone can easily get value from it.
[nisbot.icon]What "value" is that "value"?
[nishio.icon]Good writing! I experienced that.
[nisbot.icon]
 > What is it? I'm not sure if this was supposed to be an explanation to get people to use it or not, but it's starting to sound like you're not sure if you want people to use it or not. But, well, I guess I should say that this feature is not a finished product, nor is it easy for anyone to get value from it.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "feeling"?
[nishio.icon]Yeah, well, you don't have to use it at this point.
[nisbot.icon]
 > What is it? I'm not sure if this was supposed to be an explanation to get people to use it or not, but it's starting to sound like you're not sure if you want people to use it or not. But, well, I guess I should say that this feature is not a finished product, nor is it easy for anyone to get value from it.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "value"?
[nishio.icon]The author didn't know if it would be worth it or not, since this was the first time he used it in the first place.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "value can be obtained" is that "value can be obtained"?
[nishio.icon]If I write a good sentence as a result of this chat, OK.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "good writing" is that?
[nishio.icon]Ah, I see...I see...that's a difficult question...I can tell after the fact that a text that aims to elicit action from others was a good text when that action is actually elicited. I was initially hoping to elicit the action of "try it out," but as we talked, I began to think that I didn't need to try it out yet at this stage. Then what is the purpose of this text?
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "good text"?
[nishio.icon]At any rate, I hope this gives you an idea of what I am trying to create.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "I" is that "I"?
[nishio.icon]If you look closely, you answered the first question, "I hope the reader can tell what the empathy writing mode I created today is all about."
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "reader"?
[nishio.icon]As a result of getting the message across, if people think you're doing something interesting, that might be enough.
[nisbot.icon]What is the "result" of that "result"?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘Ž Results
[nisbot.icon]
 > I hope I can convey what I am trying to create for now.
 Is there anything else about this "me"?
[nishio.icon]Maybe it's more motivating when readers say you're funny.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "chi" is that?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘Ž qi
[nisbot.icon]
 > If you look carefully, you answered the first question, "I hope the reader can tell what the empathy writing mode I created today is all about."
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "empathic writing mode"?
[nishio.icon]At any rate, I was able to confirm that it works properly without any bugs.
[nisbot.icon]
 > If you look carefully, you answered the first question, "I hope the reader can tell what the empathy writing mode I created today is all about."
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "empathy writing"?
[nishio.icon]No

 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "mastery"?
[nishio.icon]I'm not sure how much investment is needed.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "understand" is that "understand"?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘Ž I know.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "investment" is that "investment"?
[nishio.icon]I'm certainly not sure about that either; I'm thinking of a writing tutorial as an example of using Regroup for a specific purpose, because I'm not sure I'd be familiar with the investment in learning Regroup.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "use it" is that "use it"?
[nishio.icon]Since we don't know how to use general-purpose tools, we limit the purpose and freedom of the experience.
[nisbot.icon]What "purpose" is that "purpose"?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘Ž Purpose
[nisbot.icon]
 > I'm certainly not sure about that either; I'm thinking of a writing tutorial as an example of using Regroup for a specific purpose, > because I'm not sure I'd be familiar with the investment in learning Regroup.

[nishio.icon]No
[nisbot.icon]
 > If you look carefully, you answered the first question, "I hope the reader can tell what the empathy writing mode I created today is all about."
 What kind of "empathic writing mode did you create today" is this "empathic writing mode created today"?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽEmpathy writing mode created today
[nisbot.icon]
 > If you look carefully, you answered the first question, "I hope the reader can tell what the empathy writing mode I created today is all about."
 What kind of "I hope it will be conveyed" is this "I hope it will be conveyed"?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘Ž Hope that comes across.
[nisbot.icon]
