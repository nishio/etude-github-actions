>Interesting common patterns
> 
> Suppose you are executing a project A and your original objective was B.
> As I was doing it, I thought, "Oh, with this Project A, I can achieve Objective C at the same time! [Two birds with one stone! The inspiration comes to me.
> Then the purpose of Project A is somehow replaced with "B and C".
> A situation arises where, for a certain problem D in project A, there are two solutions, E and F. Given objective B, E is better, but given objective C, F is better.
> Due to the fact that the objective has somehow become multidimensional, it takes time to think about whether to choose option E or F.
>
> Should we remember that the objective of the project is not "B and C" but "B is the objective, and it is BETTER if C can be achieved together, but not MUST"?
> 
> In some situations, it is possible to pivot the project objective to C.
>
> "I'm having trouble with problem D!" What about solution E? "That won't help me achieve my objective C!" "Oh, so C is your objective, then how about a solution F?" Then, I think the solution F would be better. If you haven't decided which is the main one, you won't be able to decide until you find a solution that can satisfy both.
