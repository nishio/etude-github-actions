(Column) Emergency decomposition theory
In a book "Intellectual Productivity Improvement System: DIPS" Kobayashi Tadahito proposed the following checklist on how to deal with an [emergency] which we have to do more than we can do today. *1

 Can we lower the quality?
 Can we reduce the amount?
 Can we postpone deadlines?
 Can we change the method?
 Can you substitute a thing with another one?
 Can you solve it with money?
 We should stop it if there is no way we can.
