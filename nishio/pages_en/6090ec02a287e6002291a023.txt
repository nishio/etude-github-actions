 This is the best shot of the day. Ferris wheel.
 
 I think it is a waste of moir√©. The bicubic method of resampling is used, but the circumferential direction is stretched by a factor of 5, so pixels adjacent to each other in the output image are separated by 5 pixels in the original image. So, in such an image with high spatial frequency, the components with wavelengths shorter than the sampling interval will be wrong. What can I do?

 I am steadily accumulating sample images for ConicFilm. I might as well replace the background images and icons with my own photos. It is a waste that half of the explanation page is devoted to the copyright holder's explanation, no matter how much it is CC.
