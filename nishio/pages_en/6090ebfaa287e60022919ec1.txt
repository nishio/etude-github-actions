 *1223088534*Difference between FALL and AUTUMN
 >>
 Etymologically related to the Latin word autumnus "season of increase". (Random House English-Japanese Dictionary)
 
 On the other hand, "fall" has a more negative meaning, such as "collapse, downfall, or depravity.

 I see... There doesn't seem to be a clear distinction between the two, but if anything, autumn is cooler.
 I wonder if "autumn" is the image of mountains turning bright red with autumn leaves, and "fall" is the image of their leaves turning brown and falling in a hara-hara manner.

 *1223106827*Kamata was surprisingly close.
 I left Kamata at 4:30 p.m., but I'll arrive at Akihabara at 5:00 p.m.
 
 The big street in front of Akihabara is north-south direction. The direction I had thought was north is west. I learned it.
 
 *1223113856*[Mid-term limit] Parallel
 They are coming to HogeBOF.
 
 I used to think that using Verilog to do the calculation at the end of the readout would make it faster because it could be done in parallel, but I heard that Erlang is not very fast. I heard that Erlang's calculation is not fast at all, and in fact, Haskell is very strong in parallel. Hmmm...

 **1223134651*[Mid-term limit] read-only cost
 Homework assigned by id:Voluntas. Calculate the cost of reading through the middle limit.
 
 In the final round, I have 5 cards in my hand and 11 cards that have not yet been opened. There are 3 ways to play your hand: 5p3 ways. There are 11p6 ways to play a hand other than your own.
 
 >|python|
 >>> def p(n, m):
 ...     result = 1
 ...     for i in range(m):
 ...             result *= n
 ...             n -= 1
 ...     return result
 ... 
 >>> p(5, 3)
 60
 >>> p(11, 6)
 332640
 >>> _ * 60
 19958400
 ||<
 
 Therefore, "all the possible moves" in the first turn of the game, which means "lick the patterns of all the possible moves in the final round and play the card with the highest probability of winning," takes about 20 million moves, which is about 4 seconds on a 2.4GHz Core2Duo MacBook. Since I didn't specifically make the program run in parallel, it probably only uses one of the cores, so even if I just split it in half and share the workload, it would still be 2 seconds.
 
 Round 4, I have 8 cards in my hand and 17 cards that have not been opened yet. 8P3 * 17P3 = 2994001920. 150 times the final round readout. Simple calculation: 10 minutes. But of course, this is only based on the calculation of, for example, "I'm going to lick all the possible hand patterns for round 4 and play the card with the highest probability of getting into the middle," so I don't know if "the remaining cards after playing that won't hold up for the last turn" and so on. Multiply this by 20 million if you want to read all the way through to the end. 1.9 billion years by simple math. Am I right?
 
 The number of patterns for reading only the third round is 71955021600, roughly 4 hours; several universes are needed to read through all of them after the third round.
 
 So my homework was to estimate how much AmazonEC would cost, but it's not possible, so JK is the final answer. The policy itself needs to be rethought.
 
 It is unlikely that the load on a web application will increase by a factor of 3 billion (unless the load increases by the square of the order of the number of users). Users don't suddenly increase from 2 to 6 billion. However, in the case of a game like this, even a slight increase in the depth of reading can easily increase the amount of calculation by billions of times. It is very frightening.

 <body>fall is an American word. In English, it is autumn.

 <body>To begin with, reading a game is not that easy because the number of moves increases exponentially. </body>.

 <body>I think you misunderstand Verilog. <br>If you're talking about creating a new processing system or hardware, <br>it's a simulation-specific language, so it's rather slow because of the overhead involved. </body>
