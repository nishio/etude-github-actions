Organizational theory without employment contracts
 Many [organizational theories] implicitly assume the basic premise that "the [employment contract] binds you for about five days a week, and that you have a boss and subordinates, and the boss has the right to command and control.
 As Drucker points out, expert groups are hard to govern that way.
 	[Drucker] [The knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates.]
 So, rather, it is the volunteer organizations and open source communities, etc., where there is no pay, no restraints, no command authority, etc., that can be helpful.
 When we think about [the survival of an organization], we tend to be conscious of [the survival of money], because we bind people by employment contracts.
 If you remove that condition, [the survival of the human mind] is more important to the survival of the organization.
  When people's hearts and minds don't survive in a for-profit company, [turnover] jumps and the money is damaged.
