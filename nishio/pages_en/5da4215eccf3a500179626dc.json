	I would like to have a better format for storing knowledge.
		I talked to [Tomoya Tachikawa] about it, and he said that it might be a more [subjective] [chatbot].
		[20191011 Tachikawa Nishio]
		Seeing Masui-san's play of putting everything in Gyazo
 		Then it's just a "thumbnail view of the page" and "edit and search".
 		I think there might be something one step further.
	The most primitive form of subjectivity is [likes and dislikes].
		This is a binary classifier

	[The form of knowledge representation must be updated].
		Scrapbox is on a pretty good track.
		However, "[updating the knowledge representation format]" and "the knowledge representation format must be updated" are not common keywords.
		The problem is where the keywords are strings.
			"Knowledge representation format must be updated" and "knowledge representation format update" have disparate string-like commonalities.
			("knowledge", "representation format", "update")

	There is a hint that the keyword may be "[stock of associations]" but it hasn't solidified yet.
  We can now use search to find non-keywords (e.g. documents) from keywords, what we need is to find keywords from non-keywords, right?
