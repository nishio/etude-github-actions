Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning
Hado van Hasselt, Arthur Guez, David Silver
 General Q learning overestimates action value in certain situations.
 How often do these things happen, do they negatively affect performance, and can they be prevented?
 DQN is strongly influenced by the overvaluation of some Atari 2600 games.
 Double Q-Learning
 Curb overvaluation and perform better.
