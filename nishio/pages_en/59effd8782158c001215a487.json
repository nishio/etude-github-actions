If you don't have it, make it.

 >I would like to mention the "if you don't have it, make it" culture of programmers, but does anyone know of any sources that would provide evidence that such a culture is real in the first place?

 Bricolage -- [Bricolage - Wikipedia https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A5]
  [Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss], in his book "Wild Thoughts" (1962) and elsewhere, called "bricolage" the use of scraps and leftover materials to create tools that serve an immediate need, regardless of their original use.
   He compared the ancient human way of knowledge, "[wild thinking]," to manufacturing through bricolage, and contrasted this with the post-modern engineering way of thinking, "[cultivated thinking]," and considered bricolage as a universal way of knowledge that is also applicable to modern society.
  In a discussion of constructionism in pedagogy, [Seymour Papert] described a method of problem solving and learning through challenge, trial, and play as the opposite of the analytical solution method, which he described as bricolage.
  Sherry Turkle, in her 1995 book, "[The Connected Mind] - Identity in the Age of the Internet" (Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet), She applies the concept of bricolage to program development and organizational theory.
   She defends the "bricoleur style" in programming as valid against the traditionally constructed (as she calls it) "planner approach."
    This is similar to the contrast between learning schools and traditional planning schools in management studies ([Strategy Safari]).
