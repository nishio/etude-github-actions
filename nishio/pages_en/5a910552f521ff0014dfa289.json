Reduce the time box for tasks you are not good at.

  I personally am doing very well.
  Maybe it's because it's an environment very suited to a time box where there's nothing else to do and the end of time is set in stone.

 I don't know if it's helping me organize my tasks, although it's good to say I'm going to write down the ideas that come to mind...
  I don't think much of the task...
  The reason is simple: I am not good at the task of "organizing tasks.
  I can't maintain focus for 25 minutes on task management.
  Can we acknowledge this first and make it a shorter timebox?
  Three more stations to go and I'll be at my destination, so I'm organizing my tasks.
