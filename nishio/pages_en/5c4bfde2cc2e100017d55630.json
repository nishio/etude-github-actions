Why is software unstable?
When I was walking around during the day, I suddenly wondered why software becomes [unstable] year after year, and I have not been able to answer the question. Unlike matter, software is made of information, so it itself should not deteriorate, but what causes deterioration?
	[Because they do not adapt [autonomously] to [changes in the environment] outside.
	[I think it's because even though it's unstable [people don't die, so the findings don't accumulate].

At first glance, it may seem straightforward to say, "We must pay the cost of adapting to changes in the external world," but there are a lot of things we don't understand, such as "[why does the external world change?]" and "[why is it necessary to adapt to changes in the external world?]" and "why aren't adaptation costs paid?"
	[Kohei Okubo]
	 I suppose "Why does the outside world change?" and "Why do we need to adapt?" are the same as the relationship between the natural world and living things.
		The reason why costs are hard to be paid is that many people still do not understand the reality that "the Internet is exposed to daily changes just like the natural world.
