Export Method API
	It would be good to have [API] in [Export Method].
	I was thinking of [dumpfb], which writes Facebook activity to a file.
		[node-webkit].
		Consider using [Puppeteer] in new version
		I don't want to hardcode my Facebook password.
		In the previous version, a window would appear, so I had to manually log in to Facebook and then launch the export.
		Can you put up a window? â†’Yes, I can.
		Or rather, it should be a Chrome extension.
		I wonder if a Chrome extension can export files (see [chrome.fileSystem https://developers.chrome.com/apps/fileSystem]).
		No, wait, since we're going to create a service called "write out method -> make it into a KJ method sticky" soon anyway, why not just provide an API for the write out method?

	With this API, it's not just about Facebook activity.
		Twitter (my own and others')
		When you see someone else's Scrapbox or Wikipedia, automatically clip it
		Clip from Amazon
		Of course, it can be used for the write out method (= manually get it out of your brain)
	The amount of work is overwhelmingly larger than the manual export method (= not assuming that a human being will see all of it).
		I don't even look at the entire current Twitter timeline.
		Chronological order (most recently added first)
		Display for Review
			Incremental Reading-like display
			Do not display items with a date close to the last display date
			A gumbo that might yield something new."
		search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)
			Shouldn't the search also be recorded as an activity?
			You should be able to create tags and groups after the fact.
		You can "Like."
			Keep the "like" and "view" values and use the "like/display" count as a measure of goodness
		A reply button allows you to comment while keeping the link.
			One click to quote the original text, so when you want to edit it, reply with a new text instead of editing the original.
