 Physical condition...
 Yesterday, a small pimple that was growing all over my person has grown a size...
 There are a lot of Saturday and Sunday events, but I think it might be best to avoid alcohol.

 Wow, I didn't realize that the minutes of the Diet can be easily viewed on the Internet.

 What is the cost of processing uranium fuel in Japan compared to the international price?
 　When I asked for the data, I was told that the data was submitted in 1987, and the data was submitted in 1987, so I am not sure how old the data is for comparison, but here is the source from Nuclear Energy Agency, and according to this source, the cost of processing uranium fuel is roughly $200 per kilogram, The average cost of processing uranium fuel is about $200 per kilogram of uranium. The average is $200, with a low of $175 and a high of $300.
 　I did not submit a request to attend this to the NFCD, so I am not sure if I can ask the Science and Technology Agency about this, but I am not sure it is possible this time.
 Mr. Xing Xing, Explainer, I would like to respond to your question.
 　I am not sure if I can give you a sufficient answer, but I was wondering if the uranium conversion and processing contract between the Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute (JNC) and JCOR has been affected by this project, and if the operating conditions have become severe in various ways. I checked the price per kilogram of uranium, and it was about 300,000 yen. This is the price per kilogram of uranium for conversion processing.
 　On the other hand, the world as a whole is in a sense a trade secret, and the figures for uranium fuel processing costs are not readily available, but according to the results of an evaluation by the OECD/NEA, the cost of uranium fuel processing, based on 1987 U.S. dollar prices, was However, according to the results of the OECD-NEA evaluation, the cost of uranium fuel processing was $300 per kilogram of uranium in 1987, based on the U.S. dollar price.
 Mr. Sugawara: I just heard that it is $300. Mr. Secretary, three hundred dollars is 300,000 yen. Three hundred thousand dollars is 300,000 yen, which is ten times more than 300,000 yen. However, unless there is a consensus that takes into account the difference in international prices, I feel that it would be better to close down this organization and leave it to the private sector.
 Mr. Xing Xing: There is one hypothetical condition, and I did not explain it well enough.
 　The OECD/NEA evaluation of the uranium fuel processing cost is probably for uranium of fine enrichment or something like that. On the other hand, the uranium conversion processing contract that JNC has concluded with JCOR is for 18.8% or medium-enriched uranium, so there are issues related to the handling of such uranium and the processing of reconversion. Please take this into consideration as well.

 Wow, uranium is surprisingly cheap.
