parable of the measure
[Parable] on whether we need to know [the author's intent].
　You can use [the ruler] to scratch your back.
　If it makes you feel comfortable, it's a [useful] use.
　However, it is foolish to not know what the scale on a ruler is for and not think of using it for the purpose of measuring length
　　Don't you need this pattern?"
　　No, they are there, and you simply don't understand how to use them."

In [The Technology Behind Coding], I discussed the idea that programming language features were created by their authors for some purpose, and that it is useful to know their intentions.
