 **1323653323*Made a video of a new type of STG!
 We made a video introducing the new sensory STG introduced yesterday in "<a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20111211/1323533985'>Next Sunday, we will exhibit a new sensory shooting game</a>".

 Since it is still under development, I have only introduced the highlights. This large table monitor was not given to us, but is on loan, so we may not have a chance to display it after TREFEST is over. So I would like to record the video of the exhibition on site.
