Earn and maintain a well-founded reputation

Acquire and maintain a reputation.
xcvii 

It is the utility of fame. Fame costs money. Fame is as rare as there are many ordinary people, because it only comes with outstanding ability. Once acquired, it is easy to maintain. Fame imposes many obligations, but it also does more. When it is by virtue of exalted power or an exalted sphere of activity, it rises to a kind of adoration and creates a kind of dignity. But it is only a well-founded reputation that lasts forever.
