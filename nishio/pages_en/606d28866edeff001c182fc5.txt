human perspective
People who think they are thinking from the human perspective are just misinterpreting [their perspective] as the common human perspective.

Because they do not understand that people have different perspectives, they identify "those similar to themselves" as "mankind" and misidentify their own perspective as "the common perspective of mankind" because they are similar and therefore their perspectives are also similar.
