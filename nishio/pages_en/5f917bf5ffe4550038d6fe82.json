 Thoughts.
 　This is a pain in the ass.
　　Determine the intersection of line segments and sort the intersection points
　　Alternate because we know the chop starts from the outside.
　　Connect odd-numbered intersections with even-numbered intersections. Since we are only dealing graphically, it is sufficient to connect the two ends of the cut edges, but it is necessary to avoid twisting the edges.
　　　We can't use the inner product to determine that, so we'll do a line segment crossing determination.
　　Once you have the edge set, just count the number of connected components.
　　I wonder what [line intersection determination] would do.
　　　I see, just project it onto the normal vector and see if the signs are reversed.
　　I've got an article up to the point where I'm looking for intersections, so I'll put it in my library later.

　Official Explanation
　　Oh, I only counted the number of cut edges.
　　Okay, you say "polygonal" so there are no holes.
　　I thought too hard.
