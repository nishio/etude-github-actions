Something that can be rewritten mechanically.

	[Scrapbox] is an interesting [form of knowledge representation
	 On the other hand, it is strongly oriented toward "[human use].
  There is a [technical tradeoff] between [collaborative editing] and mechanically rewritten APIs.
  In this [trade-off], you have chosen to co-edit
 I want a form of representation of knowledge [for machines].
 	Scrapbox is appealing, but it is difficult for machines to handle this
  Co-editing is not that important in my use case.
  Then why not ditch collaborative editing and instead create "[something that is not Scrapbox]" that is easy to [update mechanically]?
  Compatible with Scrapbox as a data representation format
  I can export in JSON and import into Scrapbox, or copy and paste on a page-by-page basis.

Forms of Knowledge Representation
	page title
 row
 Whitespace at the beginning of a line expresses hierarchical structure
 Brackets in a line represent links to other pages
 2-hop links to other pages, even if they don't necessarily exist at the moment.
 Images are useful for people to see, but still a hurdle for machines to see.

About Co-Editing
	Good if commitments are made at a fine granular level.
 Sticky note scrapers are pretty close to this.
 If you interpret a Scrapbox line as a single sticky note, you can treat it similarly.
