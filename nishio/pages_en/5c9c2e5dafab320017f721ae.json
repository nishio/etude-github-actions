Calling a child a genius.
>I don't care if someone is amazing by absolute standards, what about calling a so-called precocious person who is "that's amazing at that age" a "genius X student" or something like that. I don't think this is good for those around them or for the person in question.
>I like to use the word "tough" in these situations. It can be used for people who are absolutely amazing or for people who are precocious. And I don't want to say "I want to be a genius" or "I want to be more of a genius," but I like that I can say "I want to be strong" or "I want to be stronger. I think the word "genius" implies resignation.

What I muttered inspired by this tweet
	When you call a child a "[genius]," some adults who have never been called geniuses get [jealous] and start saying things like, "They call you a genius, but you're not much of a genius," or "You're a genius and you don't even know this?" or "You're a genius, but you don't know this?
	However, once you and those around you recognize that "it is natural to be able to do it," you feel fear and unconsciously avoid challenges that could lead to "failure.
	In order to create something that does not yet exist in the world, we need "[the] power to move forward on one's own," so we shine a spotlight on young people who have that power and encourage them to consolidate their resources, but if that light is creating [curses] on the adults around them and fear of losing them, then some kind of improvement is needed.

Comparing "genius" and "strong," I see that the former is a dichotomy between "genius" and "non - genius," while the latter is a continuous value.
The dichotomy causes jealousy from "non - geniuses" to "geniuses" and fear of "geniuses" falling to "non - geniuses". [False dichotomy].
