Shifting the blame for events caused by wimps onto others.
	The phenomenon of shifting the blame for events caused by one's own [wimpiness] as if one is not at fault at all and others are 100% to blame.
 I tentatively applied [wimp] as a translation of wimp, but it may be too strong a word.
	[Macho and Wimp]
	[LUCANTIMAN].
