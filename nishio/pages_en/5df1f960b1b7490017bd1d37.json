		>I mentioned earlier that textual information data can be used to share information with people who come late. People who come late are not only those who are five or ten minutes late as in the case of people who come late for a meeting, but also those who come ten years late. How much do you remember about what happened ten years ago? If you keep a diary, you could look at your diary. What were you doing [on this day ten years ago]? I don't remember. I don't think you can remember either, but if I search and read the postings of the date ten years ago in the groupware later, there is a possibility that I can understand to some extent. Also, there are people who join a company after 10 years. People who join a company 10 years later do not have information about what happened in the company 10 years ago. However, that person can search for the information and find it, and later learn things like, "Oh, so this is the reason why the rules are the way they are now. In other words, information sharing through textual information is not just information sharing at the present time, but it is a mechanism that allows information to be shared 10 years into the future, 20 years into the future, and far into the future.
