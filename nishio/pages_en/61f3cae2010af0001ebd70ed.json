Recognize when things are ripe, and enjoy it.

Recognize when things are ripe, and enjoy it.
xxxix 

All works of nature mature at a certain point in time, improving until then and degenerating thereafter. Few works of art are so mature that there is no room for improvement. It is the special privilege of the man of taste to enjoy everything in its most well-ripened state. Not all can do so, and not all who can do so know it. The fruit of intelligence also has a time of ripening. It is well to know this, both as to its value in use and in exchange.
