Returns an undefined number of results
	Case 1: Return an indefinite number of items from a fixed N, with no duplicates and in no particular order
		Just make [Softmax], which returns 1 out of N, a binary identification of N "to choose or not to choose".
	Case 2: Returns indefinite number of items from fixed N with duplicates and in order
		Introduced N+1th indicating EOS
		[RNN] configuration and repeat until EOS
	Case 3: Return N indefinite A-dimension vectors from N indefinite A-dimension vectors, with no duplicates and in no order
		Learning to map from dimension A to dimension D
		Construct an RNN that produces an indefinite number of D-dimensional outputs in the manner of Case 2.
		Binary identification of "to select or not to select" by inner product between D-dimensional outputs
	Case 4: Selecting a subset of a set
		This is equivalent to returning an indefinite number of elements from the set in no overlap and in no particular order.
			That is, a binary identification of "to choose or not to choose" for each
			Case 1 if the set size is fixed, Case 3 if not.
	Case 5: What if I want to select an indefinite subset from a set?
		If the set is small enough, enumerating subsets leads to case 1.
			It will be 2^N enumerations.
		If the set size is fixed and the subset columns are ordered, then we can turn case 1 into the RNN configuration of case 2.
			Case 1 is a configuration that produces an N-dimensional vector, so we can make it an RNN that stops softmaxing it.
		What if the subset columns are unordered?
			Hmmm, difficult
   Is it a reasonable alternative to sort the teacher data by defining [order]?
 Case 6: To select an indefinite number of "indefinite, duplicate, ordered" columns from a set
 	Just introduce an N+2th to represent the element delimitation and make it an RNN.
 	In unordered case
 		It would be good to introduce an order
