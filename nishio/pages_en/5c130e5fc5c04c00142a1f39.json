Do sales heal all?
	The "sales heal all" crowd.
		Sales are the most important.
	My current feelings
		Customer satisfaction is paramount.
		Next is employee satisfaction.

Q: Is there a difference between sales and customer satisfaction?
A: Of course different.

For example, in the business of selling 10,000 yen osechi, if after accepting reservations and collecting money in December, the osechi arrives in January and the customer is not satisfied at that time, sales are high but customer satisfaction is low.

The way to increase sales with this business model is to
	Increase the number of people who order by raising their expectations through advertising, etc. (not caring whether or not they are satisfied afterwards)
	Provide customers with something that satisfies them, and they will become repeat customers the following year and beyond.
There are two ways to do this. The former will increase sales in the short term.
