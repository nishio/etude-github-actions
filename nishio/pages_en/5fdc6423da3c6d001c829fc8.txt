Complementary Graphs for Connected Graphs

Title needs improvement
In the [Construct One] problem for [connected graphs], it is sometimes good to consider [complementary graphs].

[Complementary graphs of a disconnected graph are connected.]

If a graph G with 3 or more vertices is disconnected, then for any vertex a, there is some disconnected vertex b (since if there is not, it contradicts that the graph is disconnected).
At this time, for any vertex c, which is neither a nor b, there can be no edge of both ac and bc in G (since if there were, a and b would be connected via c).
Given a complementary graph H, edge ab is contained in H and either ac or bc is contained in H, so abc is connected
