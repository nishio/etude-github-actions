 *1307096599*Color lines with multiples of 3 in Emacs
 To be precise, I wanted to have a green and blue background when the line numbers are 1 and 2 divided by 3. I tried to refer to http://www.bookshelf.jp/soft/meadow_26.html#SEC314, but in the end, small modifications did not result in the desired behavior, so I did a lot of studying. I studied it a lot.
 First, you can use <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Overlays.html#Overlays'>Overlays - GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</a>. Overlays are created by specifying a start point and an end point.
 
 >|lisp|
 ; stripes.el
 
 (defun stripes-create ()
   "Colors lines in current buffer alternatively.
 This will not monitor changes of the buffer."
   (save-excursion
     (save-restriction
       (widen)
       (stripes-remove)
       (goto-char (point-min))
       (while (not (eobp))
 	(forward-line stripes-lcount)
 	(let ((ppp (point))
 	      ovl)
 	  (unless (eobp)
 	    (forward-line stripes-lcount)
 	    (setq ovl (make-overlay ppp (point)))
 	    (overlay-put ovl 'face 'stripes-face)))))))
 ||<
 (widen) removes narrowing. (goto-char (point-min)) moves to the beginning of the buffer, then forward-line moves down by stripes-lcount (usually 1) lines, make-overlay in the range of before-ppp and after (point), and overlay-put to specify the FACE.
 
 The remainder of the line number divided by 3 can be found by (% (line-number-at-pos) 3).
 
 In stripes.el, I've implemented my own function to get all overlays and then check the value of that face and remove it, but you can do it like (remove-overlays (point-min) (point-max) 'category 'stripe).
 
 The stripes.el places an overlay on the entire buffer when it enters mode, but I don't want it to do that because I have a buffer with a million lines or so for my needs. I've only put it between (window-start) and (window-end), but I'm not sure how to update it when scrolling. I wonder if I should add advice for scrolling commands. <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Defining-Advice.html#Defining-Advice'>Defining Advice - GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</a>
 
 In stripes.el, this is how you rebuild it when it's edited.
 >|lisp|
 (defun stripes-after-change-function (beg end length)
   "After change function for color alternation mode.
 Refreshes all the highlighting.  This is slow, but as mostly lists are
 not changed that often, it should be acceptable.  Arguments BEG END
 and LENGTH are not used."
   (if stripes-mode
       (stripes-create)))
 
 (add-hook 'after-change-functions
    'stripes-after-change-function)
 ||<
 
 Oh, there are scrolling hooks available: <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Standard-Hooks.html#Standard-Hooks'>Standard Hooks - GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</a> This looks good.

 <body>I was thinking of using a lot of overlays too, but stopped there, wondering what to do if I made super many, so this was helpful! </body>
