The future cannot be predicted, but the future can be invented.
In 1963, Gábor Danesh, who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in holography [Gábor Danesh - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9C%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E 3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5] wrote the book "Inventing the Future"
>We are still masters of our own destiny. Rational thought, even with the help of every conceivable electronic calculator, cannot predict the future. All that rational thought can do is to draw a map of the probability space that is currently appearing and that will be different tomorrow when one of an infinite number of possible states will be realized. Through technological and social inventions, this probability space is constantly expanding.
>[The future cannot be predicted], but [the future can be invented]. Human society exists because of man's ability to invent. The mental process of invention remains a mystery. It is rational but not logical, i.e., not deductive.
