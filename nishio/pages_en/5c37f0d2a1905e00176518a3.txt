	>Fable of the Tayupinko people
 	> Tayupinko immigration in Japan began in the 1960s, and as of 2018 there are more than three times as many Tayupinko living in Japan as Japanese.
 		> One characteristic of the Tayupinko people is that they work for very low salaries compared to the Japanese. According to one theory, they work for one-tenth or one-hundredth of the salary of the Japanese.
		>On the other hand, the Tayupinko people are not at all flexible, and their language is very specific, so the number of Japanese who can communicate with them is extremely limited.
 		>This has led to an increase in the demand for interpreters with Tayupinko in modern times, and an increasing number of Japanese are taking this position and earning high salaries.
		>The Tayupinko people are extremely dim-witted and it is extremely difficult to explain things to them in a way that they can understand.
 		>But if I speak to them in Tayupinko and tell them a story they can understand, they don't complain and continue to work nonchalantly.
 		>As a result, many Japanese lost their jobs due to labor dumping using Tayupinko people.
 	>While many Japanese are losing their jobs due to Tayupinko people, some companies have begun to assign higher level jobs to Japanese as a result of utilizing Tayupinko people in 3K workplaces.
  	> No longer would modern affluent life be possible without the Tayupinko people.
  	> It is similar to Rome, which was founded by slaves.
		>The modern society is, to put it bluntly, founded on the slave labor and labor dumping of the Tayupinko people. Japanese who can only do the same work as the slaves of Tayupinko are becoming increasingly unemployed.
  	>In these modern times, studying the Tayupinko language has become an essential skill for future employment.
  >Some may harbor ill will toward the Tayupinko people.
	  > However, the number of Tayupinko people has been increasing, and the world would not be able to speak without their presence.
 	 > Working with them and creating a comfortable working environment for them is what is required of modern businesspeople.
		>You have two paths ahead of you.
	  >One is to become an interpreter with the Tayupinko people and receive a high salary.
  	>One other path is to fight with the Tayupinko people as a labor force and get involved in a labor dumping war with them and get thinly paid.
  	>Many professions fought with them and disappeared.
  >What do you guys want to do after this?

 Interpreting with Tayupinko people was a very difficult task until a few decades ago. However, with the rapid increase in the number of Tayupinko immigrants in the 1990s, the need for interpreters increased dramatically, and the number of people who "want to communicate even if it's in katakana" increased, which led to the development of interpretation support software.

	Tayupinko immigrants, 10 million a year, that's more than the Japanese in no time. Although they tend to be short-lived.

		In many cases, they die after around three years.
	It looks like the number of interpreters for the Tayupinko language has increased by 110,000 in the seven years between 2009 and 2016.

	The most important thing to remember when conversing with a Tayupinko is to "listen to what they are saying" (read error message school).

	However, "you need to learn and speak Tayupinko" is not the same as "you need to learn and speak Tayupinko," and "learning Tayupinko will increase your income" is rather questionable.

	It is true that the government says, "It is important to learn how to think Tayupinko, but it does not mean that you should learn the Tayupinko language," but I am confused because I do not know how to learn "Tayupinko thinking" or what is "Tayupinko thinking" in the first place. I feel the difficulty of cross-cultural communication.
		>@ukkaripon: I still think communicating with Tayupinko people is a must, don't you?
		Communication" is also "a language designed by humans and imposed on slave Tayupinko people" these days, and it would be better to see Tayupinko people talking to each other (packet capturing, etc.).
  I'm rather fond of the Tayupinko people reading and writing five-hole punch tape or...

	Whether to grant human rights to the Tayupinko people
		Personally, I think it's wrong to begin with to "recognize human rights" from the top to begin with.

		>I know that the Tayupinko people are extremely dim-witted, so there is a limit to the amount of work that the Tayupinko people can take on.
  > It would be interesting if, for example, half Tayupinko and half Japanese were freed from such ability limitations.
  	nishio: The metaphor "Tayupinko people" has evolved into the powerful metaphor "half Tayupinko and half Japanese!
