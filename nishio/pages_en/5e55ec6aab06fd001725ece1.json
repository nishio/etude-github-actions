Don't use a bounding box for a hit.
When [change style after the fact] was first implemented, it worked differently than expected.

	I expected only the outer circle to turn red...

	It is picking up the corners of the bounding box.

	解決法
	　Keep the hit as a bounding box, but make it a target to be ignored by the lasso.
	　　As for the after-the-fact style change of the path, I'm inclined to be okay with that.
	　Make the hit decision a fattened path, not a bounding box.
	　Eliminate the ability to drag a path in the first place.
	　　→No, that's a hassle because you have to lasso the area every time.
	　　　One of the frustrations of existing note apps

→Resolve: [make the path fattened up to the path pertinence].
