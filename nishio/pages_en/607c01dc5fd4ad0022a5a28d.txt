It's hard to make something that helps make
I get the impression that "it's hard to make something that helps you make it," but how is it hard?

As a general idea
　If there are 1,000 people who are dissatisfied with the status quo.
　100 of them who can come up with things to improve it.
　10 people who actually start building that thing.
　One person who completes the thing.
having the feeling that ...

In this sense, making a product for "people who make things" has 1/100th the number of expected users compared to making a product for "people who are dissatisfied but cannot solve problems on their own.

I almost said, "Hardly."
　→ ["I don't know of any easy way" instead of "it's hard."]

I'm not saying don't do it because it's difficult, but understand the difficulty and figure out how to deal with it.

Especially for projects where time is limited, it becomes difficult to find "people to try out what you have created.
I can't get them to use it and get feedback to move forward with the project.

It is not enough just to have a product, but it is necessary to have a manual for people who know about it for the first time so that they can read and use it, and samples of actual products made using the product.

It is hard to claim outcomes. The outcome is "that people who use it to make things feel that it is easier here than using other tools", so you won't know unless you have a number of people who use it.
　Is this setting the bar too high?
　It's the same thing if it's "until we find a customer who will find it valuable" or "we'll release the service and solve the customer's problem," which takes time.
　　Is the problem that milestones are hard to cut?

　It's the customer's decision, so the creator has no control over it, and it's surprisingly time-consuming.
