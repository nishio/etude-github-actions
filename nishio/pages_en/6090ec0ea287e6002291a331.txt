 *1438330812*Diary full of whiteboards
 The Cybozu office where I work moved to Nihonbashi last week, and as a result of my trial and error in trying to think of a workplace environment that would increase productivity, I have come up with a rather large amount of information to record, so I made this entry.
 
 ** Partition behind the desk that doubles as a whiteboard

 ** There was a desk set up with a whiteboard to write on!
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">I found a desk in my new office that looks perfect for doing KJ method! It's a whiteboard and you can draw on it! <a href="http://t.co/Kl4CUnNt5j">pic.twitter.com/Kl4CUnNt5j</a></p>&mdash; nishio hirokazu (@nishio) <a href="https://twitter.com/nishio /status/623366701552250880">2015, July 21</a></blockquote>
 
 Someone was wondering where to buy these, so I did some light research and couldn't figure it out. And as I was researching, I saw various stories of homemade whiteboard desks...
 
 ** Turn your desk into a whiteboard
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">I saw a desk yesterday that doubles as a whiteboard! Let's use this place! But after some cool thinking, I decided it would be more convenient to use my desk as a whiteboard <a href="http://t.co/5bTpguuqRr">pic.twitter.com/5bTpguuqRr</a></p>&mdash; nishio hirokazu (@nishio) <a href="https://twitter.com/nishio/status/623668206775853060">2015, July 22</a></blockquote>

 ** Static electricity is surprisingly strong, even ordinary notepaper will stick to it.
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">I tried using it with a whiteboard sheet on it, and one unexpected and good side effect is that it is electrostatically charged, so regular notepaper (and since it is Moleskine, rather thick) sticks to it. I've tried to use it on a whiteboard sheet. I was thinking about printing it on a sticky note, but maybe sticking it with static electricity is the right way to go! <a href="http://t.co/hL9Cw0XOOH">pic.twitter.com/hL9Cw0XOOH</a></p>&mdash; nishio hirokazu (@nishio) <a href="https://twitter.com/nishio /status/623802503285510144">2015, July 22</a></blockquote>
 
 (Note: I say Moleskine, but that's a mistake for Rhodia)
 
 <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00JVO3DVY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B00JVO3DVY& linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">King Jim's electronic adsorption board RK10</a> has a similar function, but while that one costs 2500 yen, this one is A1 size, 100 yen per sheet, and contains 25 sheets. Incidentally, the paper I pasted at this time was still stuck to the board when I took a day off and came back the next day.
 
 ** Which means you can use unglued paper, right?
 
 I used to get a display image from Amazon from the ISBN list of the books I had, lined them up and printed them out on my printer, so I pasted them in.
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">I had a book cover printed on paper and cut, and by itself it moved in the wind, and it was a pain to glue it all together, but with a sheet that generates static electricity But when I used a sheet that generates static electricity, it stuck perfectly. It's smoother than sticky notes when you peel it off, and you can slide it around. <a href="http://t.co/zuO1AXD7rW">pic.twitter.com/zuO1AXD7rW</a></p>&mdash; nishio hirokazu (@nishio) <a href="https://twitter.com/nishio/status/625256164029108224">2015, July 26</a></blockquote>
 
 This is what it looks like when you put up about 85 sheets of A1.
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">85 pages. That's about the limit. <a href="http://t.co/35WKBg0Dew">pic.twitter.com/35WKBg0Dew</a></p>&mdash; nishio hirokazu (@nishio) <a href="https://twitter.com/nishio /status/625268602665459712">2015, July 26</a></blockquote>
 
 By the way, this, which is just printer paper, has been hard to stick to, about 5 out of 200 sheets. Only that one is rather easy to fall off, I wonder why? Is it because it's thin and bent and that's what's disturbing it, or has it been moistened by the vapor from my body due to falling off and touching it over and over again?
 
 ** Add more whiteboards
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">I set up a whiteboard next to my monitor. I set it up vertically because it is more convenient for the space, but as a result, it also functions as a book reader that allows you to view four pages of printed material at the same time! <a href="http://t.co/L0f5mLvNN8">pic.twitter.com/L0f5mLvNN8</a></p>&mdash; nishio hirokazu (@nishio) <a href="https://twitter.com/nishio /status/625851981236580352">2015, July 28</a></blockquote>
 
 <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0035FEM38/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B0035FEM38& linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Mag-X Whiteboard MX A2 size MXWH-A2</a> A whiteboard that is as cheap as 1061 yen but has a magnet that sticks.
 
 However, if I use the eraser that has been used on regular whiteboards, my desk will be covered with black powder. I bought an eraser for myself, but I might as well wipe it off with a tissue.
 
 By the way, today, I put a "Dokodemo Sheet" on this one as well, and it stuck even to A4 paper printed on it. You don't need a magnet. I mean, it doesn't even need to be a whiteboard. If there is a smooth surface, you can stick the "Anywhere Sheet" all over it and it will become a "whiteboard & static electricity sticking anywhere", right?
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">It's going to be sheets everywhere, electrostatic absorption everywhere, even in the air. <a href="http://t.co/PQy7RgR1ua">pic.twitter.com/PQy7RgR1ua</a></p>&mdash; nishio hirokazu (@nishio) <a href="https://twitter.com/nishio /status/627038281830547456">2015, July 31</a></blockquote>
 
 Not even a surface was needed for the purpose of electrostatic adsorption!
 
 Even if there is some overlap, they stick together without any problem, so that an eight-page A4 paper can be viewed in one view without having to turn it around.
 
 ** Pen drying
 
 A whiteboard marker written on a polypropylene whiteboard sheet with ordinary alcohol-based ink will dry out after a day and night in our environment and will not disappear whether rubbed with an eraser or by hand.
 
 I thought I would have to throw it away because it did not disappear even after I sprayed it with water and blew on it with a wet wipe, but upon closer inspection, I realized that the wet wipe I used at the time was one that did not contain alcohol, so I wiped it with a wet wipe that did contain alcohol, and it easily cleaned up.
 
 The "wet wipes containing alcohol" used at that time was this one from the company: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B000FQNUGA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=B000FQNUGA&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Elier sterilizable alcohol towels, 100 sheets per body</a>.
 
 If you think about it, it might be useful to have a line on the whiteboard that you can rub off, and if you want to erase it, you can erase it with alcohol wipes.
