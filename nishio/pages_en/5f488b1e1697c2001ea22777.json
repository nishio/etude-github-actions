　Isn't keyphrase extraction what is needed?
　Maybe we need a "link suggestion" so to speak?
　Document set and one new document entered
　Output "link by common keyphrase" from new document to document set

　　keyphrase extraction
　　　given a document
　　　A short string is obtained.
　　　We call this short string a "key phrase.
　　　You may create links after the fact between documents where keyphrases are common, but you don't care about that at the keyphrase extraction stage.
　　link suggestion
　　　The main purpose is to suggest [link
　　　The set of documents to be linked is given from the beginning
　　　Scores links based on their usefulness as links, rather than scoring key phrases
　　　　For example, a link with a very high number of occurrences is not useful and will score lower.
　　　　　This depends on the use case.
　The "occurrence" of "join if it occurs twice" in [RAKE] can be interpreted as extending to a set of documents, not just a new document.

　　For example, in the chat interactive use case, "logs" correspond to "existing documents".
　　　We don't just look at the latest posts and extract key phrases.
　　Use case to suggest links from a newly written document to a document stored in Scrapbox
　I noticed when I was making [Scrapbox Keyphrase Suggestions].
