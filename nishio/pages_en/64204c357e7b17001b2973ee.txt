Moore's Law for Everything
[https://moores.samaltman.com/ Moore's Law for Everything] [Sam Altman] 2021
	The following is a summary, lines with [nishio.icon] and their children are my comments

~~~
	The rapid development of AI and its ability to think and learn is expected to bring about major changes in the social economy.
		Much power shifts from labor to capital.
		If public policy does not adapt, many people will be worse off
	To address this, we need to design a system that more equitably distributes wealth by taxing companies, land, and other assets.
		[property taxation][nishio.icon].
	This technological revolution is unstoppable.
		1: This revolution will create tremendous wealth
			Once a sufficiently powerful AI becomes a "workforce," the price of the various types of labor that affect the cost of goods and services approaches zero.
		2: Drastic policy changes are needed to distribute this wealth and allow more people to pursue the life they want
		3: If these two things work, people's standard of living will be better than ever.
	Fundamental shift in policy is needed
  [* Not to address [current] social or political issues,
  [* It must envision a radically different society [in the near future].
1:
	Technological progress is on an exponential curve, and the AI revolution will be the fourth major technological revolution after agriculture, industry, and computing.
	Progress over the next 100 years will far outstrip all progress since the invention of fire and the wheel.

2: [Moore's Law].
 There are two ways to improve people's standard of living: individuals can earn more money or lower prices.
 	Wealth = purchasing power = how much you can get with the resources you have
 The best way to increase social wealth is to lower the cost of goods
 	[Moore's Law: doubles performance for the same price about every two years.
 	Other costs such as housing, health care, and education have risen markedly
 		Labor is a cost.
 		Robots that build, AI doctors, AI teachers
 	Moore's Law is a utopia where the price of things halves every two years.
 	　Technology can make it happen.

3: Capitalism for All
 A stable economic system requires both [growth] and [inclusiveness
 	Growth: (1)
	 	Many people want their lives to improve every year.
	 	Zero-sum world, democracy becomes confrontational, people try to take from each other
	 Inclusiveness:.
	 	Everyone having a reasonable opportunity to obtain the resources they need to live the life they want = fairness
 Capitalism is a powerful engine of growth
 	Rewards investing in assets that create value
 	Investment generates technological benefits.
 	Profit sharing → becomes an incentive system.
 	Can lead to inequalities
			Traditional way to deal with inequality: progressive taxation
				Not doing so well.
				The future is going to be much, much worse.
				Because the proportion of value produced by humans will decrease.
 Let's tax capital, not labor.
 	Distribute ownership and wealth directly to citizens
 	Better ways to address inequality
	The following two sources of wealth will dominate
		1) Companies, especially those using AI
		(2) Land with a fixed supply
	American Equity Fund [American Equity] [American Equity Fund].
 	Taxes on land owned by businesses and individuals above a certain assessed value
 	2.5% of the company's market value is transferred as a stock transfer.
 	Distribute to citizens over 18 years of age.
		All citizens receive more money from the Fund each year as long as the country continues to improve
		Government-funded industries face real pressures as more people choose their own services in a competitive marketplace
	 Taxing taxation on shares would align incentives among businesses, investors, and citizens.
			As people's personal assets rise in tandem with the country's assets, they will have a literal stake in the success of their country.
	Henry George, an American political economist, proposed the idea of a land value tax in the late 1800s.
		The increase in the value of land is due to the network effect of the work that society performs around the land.
		The landowner did not do all the work.
		So it's fair to share that value with the society that did the work.
			[property taxes][nishio.icon].
	The New Social Contract
		floor for everyone
		　Underpinning all of them.
		ceiling for no one
		　I won't hold anyone's head down.
		A shared belief that technology can and must create a virtuous cycle of social wealth
	A world where everyone benefits from capitalism as an owner.
		Focus on creating a "more good" (better) world, not a "less bad" one.
		"more good" would be better.
		"more good" is optimization to make the pie as large as possible
		"less bad" is to divide the pie as fairly as possible.
		Both can raise people's standard of living for once.
		　Continued growth is only possible with MORE GOOD, where the pie gets bigger.

4: Implementation and Troubleshooting
	Taxes 2.5% of market value annually on companies above a certain amount and pays the fund in shares
		Tax 2.5% of the value of all private property, payable in dollars
	Wealth available as capital for American Equity Fund
		U.S. companies alone are worth about $50 trillion, measured by market capitalization
		Assume it will at least double in the next 10 years, as has been the average over the past 100 years.
	There is approximately $30 trillion worth of privately owned land in the U.S.
		Assuming approximately doubling in 10 years.
		This is somewhat faster than historical rates, but as the world begins to understand the shift caused by AI, the value of land, one of the few truly finite assets, should rise at a faster rate.
			Of course, the increased tax burden of holding land diminishes its value relative to other investment assets
	In 10 years, each of America's 250 million adults will have about $13,500 annually
		Its real purchasing power goes up dramatically every year.
	Companies pay taxes each year by issuing new shares equal to 2.5% of the value of their stock
	We need to design a system that prevents people from consistently voting themselves more money. A constitutional amendment to establish allowable taxation would be a powerful safeguard. For example, taxes on businesses must be much smaller than the average growth rate of those businesses.
		"I'll raise the tax rate more and increase the distribution to everyone!" and the vote goes to those who are popular, the tax rate will rise to a level that will hinder corporate growth, so the Constitution should provide that the tax rate cannot rise above a certain level[nishio.icon].
	Also need a robust system to quantify the actual value of land
 	Theoretically, the best system is one that taxes only the value of the land and not the improvements built on it.
 Ensure that future distributions from the fund cannot be borrowed or sold as collateral
 　If you don't do this, people who think only in the short term will become suckers[nishio.icon].
 　 It's like borrowing money from a consumer loan and playing pachinko, because people do things that are obviously a huge loss in the long run.

5: Migration to the new system
	With technology to create more wealth and policies to distribute it equitably, a great future is possible.
	During the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was able to enact a huge social safety net that no one would have thought possible five years earlier. We are now in a similar moment.
		1933 [New Deal policies][nishio.icon].
			[New Deal policy - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E6%94%BF%E7%AD% 96]
	A politically feasible way to launch the American Equity Fund, and a way to lessen the shock of the transition period, is a bill that would gradually move to 2.5%.
	　2To ensure that the tax rate is 2.5% when GDP increases by 50% from the time the law is enacted.
	　Starting with a small distribution can be motivating and help provide a sense of security for the new future.
	　Sounds like it will take a long time to achieve 50% GDP growth.
	　　It took 13 years for the economy to grow 50% to 2019 levels
	　But with AI, growth will be extremely rapid.

The changes that are about to take place are unstoppable.
　If we embrace it and plan for it,
　We can create a fairer, happier, more prosperous society.
