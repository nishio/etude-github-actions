 *1202448083* I need to get my head out of my ass.
 
 For the first time in a long time, I woke up in the afternoon after a hard day's sleep. I guess I forgot to take my vitamins yesterday. I got to the station and realized I had left my wallet at home. This is the first time this has happened to me. I wonder what's wrong with me.

 Wait, it says FIXME in the constructor of the Array class! And "Why not simply return args?" Because? Isn't it because you don't want xs to be affected when you do destructive operations on the Array created by new Array(xs)?
