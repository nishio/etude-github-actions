DP H
[H - Grid 1 https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_h]
	An obstacle is placed on the grid, the question is how many paths are there from the upper left to the lower right by moving right or down?
 [Route Counting]
 A point on the grid is the domain, and the number of paths to that point is the DP value.
from [Dynamic Programming].

H:

code:python
 def solve(H, W, data):
     score = [[0] * (W + 1) for i in range(H + 1)]
     score[0][1] = 1
     for y in range(1, H + 1):
         for x in range(1, W + 1):
             if data[y - 1][x - 1] == ord("#"):
                 score[y][x] = 0
             else:
                 score[y][x] = (score[y - 1][x] + score[y][x - 1]) % MOD
     return score[H][W]
