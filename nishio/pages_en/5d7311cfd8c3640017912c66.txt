knowledge mounting
Both those who feel "knowledge [mounting]" when someone tells them something they don't know and those who feel they can "show that they are stronger" by saying something they don't seem to know implicitly believe that the amount of knowledge they have determines their strength.

However, there is already more knowledge stored on the Internet than any one person can remember, and it can be retrieved by searching. Experts" who have collected knowledge in a limited number of fields only have deeper knowledge in some of those fields than what is available on the Internet, and humans are already many orders of magnitude inferior to machines in terms of the overall amount of knowledge.
