Offline determination in Firestore
It cannot be done on its own.
â†’Another idea: transactions always fail when they are offline, so maybe there is a way to use that.

see: [Building a Presence with Cloud Firestore | Firebase https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/solutions/presence]

[Realtime Database] has a special path called '.info/connected'.
code:js
 firebase.database().ref('.info/connected').on('value', function(snapshot) {
    // If we're not currently connected, don't do anything.
    if (snapshot.val() == false) {
        return;
    };
    ...

What about [Cloud Firestore]?
>Connectivity - This implementation measures connectivity to Realtime Database, not Cloud Firestore.
Even the official documentation doesn't solve the problem with Cloud Firestore, but substitutes a connectivity check with Realtime Database.
