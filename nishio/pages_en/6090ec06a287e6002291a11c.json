 - Problem with < and & disappearing in code.
 - Why not enclose it in CDATA?

 HTMLParser.HTMLParseError: unknown declaration: 'CDATA[\n$x = ...

 - I'm not sure if it's OK if I set it to "&amp;" -> it doesn't show up orz.

 >>> from HTMLParser import HTMLParser

 Oh? Separated means another handler is being called?

 HTMLParser.handle_entityref(name)Â¶
     This method is called to process a general entity reference of the form &name; where name is an general entity reference. It is intended to be overridden by a derived class; the base class implementation does nothing.

 There were!

 >>> Foo.handle_entityref = lambda self, name: self.handle_data(name)
 >>> Foo().feed("foo&amp;bar")
 'foo'
 'amp'
 'bar'

 OK, so I can just change the & and so on in the code to entity references and output them back in handle_entityref.
 
 - Geez, the blanks are clogged.

 Oh, but this is not my fault that I am applying strip. I've changed the "strip()" to "strip("\n")" to fill in the blank lines.
 
 Oh, but ...

 So this is what happens. I'm sorry, but it's a bad idea to remove the blank lines. I thought it would be hard to see the blank lines when I quit, but I think it's rather easy to see, so I'm fine with it.
 
 <hr>
 
 The footnote misalignment issue, this is a race condition with image loading. So $() only waits for the document to load, not the image again? That's right.
 
 <hr>
 
 The ones that did not go in well at this point will have to be deleted now.

 C++ author Bjarne Stroustrup also says, "We tend to pay attention to syntax, but it's not the syntax that matters, it's the semantics" (TODO: source needed, probably D&E). D&E perhaps).
