PDCA and error back propagation
By executing what is planned and done, it is materialized and output, and the results can be observed. By comparing the results with expectations, the "gap between expectations and reality" ("error") becomes clear. This error is then "back propagated" by Adjust. [Knowledge at a higher level of abstraction is less likely to be modified].

Should the arrows be reversed?
