Create a large image by joining dynmap tiles together.
I want to combine the map tiles generated by [dynmap] in [mycla] into one image.
So far I have been opening the dynmap screen and taking screenshots, but I want to use cron to automatically date and save the screenshots, so I write a script.

code:python
 import numpy as np
 import skimage.util
 import skimage.io
 
 images = []
 for x in reversed(range(32)):
     for y in range(32):
         image = skimage.io.imread(f'/opt/minecraft_server/plugins/dynmap/web/tiles/world/t/0_0/{y}_{x}.jpg/')
         images.append(image)
 
 out = skimage.util.montage(images, grid_shape=(32, 32), multichannel=True)
 skimage.io.imsave('out.jpg', out)
It's done.

code:py
 import numpy as np
 import skimage.util
 import skimage.io
 
 TILE_DIR = "/opt/minecraft_server/plugins/dynmap/web/tiles"
 world = "world"
 cx = 0
 cy = 1
 
 images = []
 for x in reversed(range(32)):
     for y in range(32):
         gx = cx * 32 + x
         gy = cy * 32 + y
         image = skimage.io.imread(f'{TILE_DIR}/{world}/t/{cy}_{cx}/{gy}_{gx}.jpg/')
         images.append(image)
 
 out = skimage.util.montage(images, grid_shape=(32, 32), multichannel=True)
 skimage.io.imsave('out.jpg', out)
I thought it was a chunk and named it cx, but that doesn't seem to be the case, because a chunk is 16 units.

The tiles are joined, not manually screenshot, so they connect perfectly when lined up.
	(They are lined up when viewed on a PC, on a smartphone they appear to be line-breaking due to lack of width.)

Then we'll make sure to save this with a date and time and start it in cron.
code:py
 #!/home/nishio/venv/bin/python
 
 import numpy as np
 import skimage.util
 import skimage.io
 import time
 # settings
 TILE_DIR = "/opt/minecraft_server/plugins/dynmap/web/tiles"
 OUT_DIR = "/home/nishio/dynmap_concat"
 world = "world"
 tx = 0
 ty = 1
 targets = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]
 # end settings
 today = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
 
 for [tx, ty] in targets:
     images = []
     for x in reversed(range(32)):
         for y in range(32):
             gx = tx * 32 + x
             gy = ty * 32 + y
             image = skimage.io.imread(f'{TILE_DIR}/{world}/t/{ty}_{tx}/{gy}_{gx}.jpg/')
             images.append(image)
     out = skimage.util.montage(images, grid_shape=(32, 32), multichannel=True)
     skimage.io.imsave(f'{OUT_DIR}/{tx}_{ty}_{today}.jpg', out)

TODO When I have accumulated a certain amount, I'll connect them to make a time-lapse video.
