S-shaped utility of knowledge in a winner-take-all environment
 Principle that the [utility function] for the amount of knowledge becomes [S-curve] in a winner-take-all environment.
 Assume the following model
  The distribution of a person's amount of knowledge follows a unimodal probability distribution
  When two people encounter an opportunity to use their knowledge to create utility, the one with the greater amount of knowledge gains utility and the one with the lesser amount gains nothing
  Opportunities to use knowledge come with equal probability and the utility gained is constant
 The expected value of the utility gained is proportional to the probability that no one else has more knowledge than you
 	That is, CDF ([Cumulative distribution function - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function])
