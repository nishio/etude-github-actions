New tab after asynchronous processing
[https://gyazo.com/87abc3ad250cdff7812402fb624702c2]
　Select "Create New Map" from the menu to create a new map and open it in a new tab.
　However, this "Create New Map" is asynchronous because of the network involved, and Safari on the iPad blocks asynchronous new tabs without any notification to the user.
　As a result, only in Safari I get the "Huh? Why isn't it working? There's no error...".
　solution
　　There should be a notification that the process has started promptly after the user's operation.
　　So I'll give you a dialog.
　　Produce a button when completed.
　　　Pop up in situations where pop ups are possible.
　　　Safari silently squashes it, so the user explicitly presses the button
