　Thoughts.
　　The question is to determine whether the graph is connected when "there is a common language" is an edge with a person as a vertex.
　　Since there are 10^5 people, determining whether or not an edge exists for a pair of people would be 10^10, so it can't be done naively.
　　It seems important that the total number of Ki is capped at 100,000.
　　　The naive thing is that NM adds a strong constraint where it's 10^10.
　　　I thought you meant that it's OK to process linear orders for this.
　　　Create a "language -> set of people who speak that language." Linear Order
　　　The people in this set are consolidated
　　　　Put into [UnionFind], O(n log n)
　　　Finally, we can check if everyone's root is the same, O(n log n)
　Official Explanation
　　The principle is the same, but the arrangement is "language is also included in the vertex and interpreted as a bipartite graph".
　　　[bipartite graph with edges as vertices]
　　The graph increases to N+M vertices, but the number of edges is reduced to 10^5, so UnionFind is sufficient.
