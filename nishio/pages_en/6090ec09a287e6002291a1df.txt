 *1323533985* Next Sunday, a new shooting game will be exhibited!
 Next Sunday, we will exhibit something a little more interesting. It is a new shooting game that can be intuitively controlled using a figure on a large table-type monitor! You can control not only the position but also the angle, so you will have an unprecedented experience.

 The event is <a href='http://www.treasure-festa.com/'>Treasure Festa</a> on the 18th, at Tokyo Big Sight (Tokyo International Exhibition Center), East Hall 4. Together, Fairy Glasses and QUMA<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ny7xmCGu80'>[YouTube]</a>, another unexplored project, will be on display. There will be many other interesting exhibits as well. The booth is quite large, so you should be able to find it easily.

 This work is made by a group of friends I met at MUTOH. Besides myself, there are four of us: Jun Hisaikei, the originator and developer of QUMA; Masashi Ueda, who developed multi-mouse and multi-monitor sharing at MUTOH; and Shinta Nakayama, who belongs to a huge research institute and has experience releasing several games as a weekend game programmer. For controlling the figures, we used an improved version of the MUROTO<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MsaI8kGbzE'>[YouTube]</a> technology developed by me and Hisai last May. (The video below is a PONG-like game that runs on an iPad using MUROTO technology.)

 ViVienne Inc. played a role in this project by connecting us with a company that had a table monitor. ViVienne Inc. is a technology venture company founded by an unexplored alumnus and has connections with many unexplored alumni, including myself. If you are interested in developing new products, please contact ViVienne (innovation 'at' v-sys 'dot' jp).

 PS: I was asked what a "big table monitor" looks like, so I added a picture. You can guess the size from the keyboard in the foreground and the double-sided tape in the back. It is an amazing age because it has a multi-touch touch panel.
