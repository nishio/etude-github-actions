 *1197783899* community feel
 I'm not very good at event management or community things at all, but for some reason I find myself writing all these emails from the morning.
 
 But you know what? When you have an amazing Mr. A and an amazing Mr. B, the expected synergy that can be generated by creating a forum for Mr. A and Mr. B to exchange ideas is greater than me working hard to write code.
 
 **Oh no!
 
 I was in a hurry. For a moment, I felt like I had invited myself to the event, but then I was double-booked and couldn't go myself. It was Tuesday and Wednesday, and I was in danger.
 As someone who usually has a stack overflow when five schedules pile up, my head is about to explode from the rush of events that will be raging toward the end of the year.
 
 The notebook is a big help. But I'm not used to using it, so I look at the November section and say, "Oh, what days are open..." and it's dangerous. I'm going to write an X on all of November now.
 
 *1197786141* Well
 It's already 3:30.
 I had planned to get up in the morning and go to the coffee shop Renoir in Akihabara to write.
 I mean, I should have started the washing machine before I started writing the email. If I don't do it now, I won't have clothes for next week.

 I decided to go to Akihabara because I wanted to buy more geomags.
 
 Someone give it to me as a Christmas present. I'll pay for it.
