 **What is Saichugen?
 Saichugen (most limited; in English, most mediocre) is a card game for three players. It uses a deck of playing cards without jokers. The objective of the game is to have the median at the completion of the game. There are 5 rounds in 1 game and 3 turns(tricks) in 1 round. Winner of a round and a trick also determine in a median fashion.
 
 **Rule
 *** Dealing
 Shuffle the deck and deal 17 cards for 3 players. The last card of deck is not used in the game. Make its face down.
 
 *** Turn(Trick)
 Each player plays a card face down, and then opens it in same time. The most 'mediocre' card win the turn, neither the strongest nor the weakest. Aces are most weakest number and kings are most strongest. In case there are cards of same number the suits of the cards are considered. "Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clovers" stronger preceded. The defeated cards are let face down again.
 
 *** Round
 Repeat 3 turns. And then calculate the score of the round. The score is total of number of your opened cards in the round. If you have no opened cards your score is 0. If you have an opened card 7 your score is 7. If you have two opened cards 7 and 5 your score is 12. The median scored player win the round. The defeated player make their cards in the round face down again. They also lost the round score, that is, they get 0 points at this round.
 
 Notice if there are two or three median player, all of them win the game. When only one player got score (e.g. scores for each player are 0, 0, 23), the median is 0 and winners get 0 points.
 
 *** Game
 Deal cards and repeat 5 rounds. And then total scores of all rounds. Winner of the game is the median scored player. When a number of winner is 1, winner get +2 points and loser get -1 points. When a number of winner is 2, winner get +1 points and loser get -2 points. The point is to make it a zero-sum game.
 
 *1226653357*I don't know Shinjuku.
 We were meeting for dinner in Shinjuku. I had been to Junkudo before, so I decided to go there early and wait there. I missed the train, stopped at Sasazuka once, and got to the station. I thought the Junkudo was right before the Y-junction, but there was no Y-junction. But there was no Y-junction.
 
 -----
 
 No matter how I looked at the map, no matter how I turned it, it did not turn out to be the Y-junction that I know. After thinking for a while, I came to the conclusion that there is a Junkudo in Ikebukuro, not Shinjuku, before the Y-junction. I have no choice but to look up the location of the Junkudo in Shinjuku on my cell phone and pull up a map. Since I am now at the West Exit, I head for the East Exit for the time being.
 
 -----
 
 I was lost for about 30 minutes. I ended up being told to "look at a map," "buy a cell phone with GPS (iPhone)," and all sorts of other things. I don't think GPS can solve this problem. Then go that way, turn there," I'd sign up.
