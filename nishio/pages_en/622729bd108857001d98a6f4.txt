The hell of slacking off in the face of frustration.
from [/villagepump/hell of slacking off in frustration].
[/villagepump/nishio.icon]I personally see it in [gear metaphor].
　If the gears don't mesh, it's very [spinning].
　　Rather faster than when it's running properly because it's not properly loaded.
　　But they don't mesh, so of course there is no output at all.
　what to do about it
　　Impossible to engage while spinning at high speed.
　　First, slow down and engage.
　　Re-acceleration after engagement is difficult because the speed does not increase as much as when idling because of the load, but we think, "This is the right state of affairs.
　Daily thoughts
　　Consider that "'Fast turnover is a good thing' is a false assumption."
