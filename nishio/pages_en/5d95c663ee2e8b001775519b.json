meta-aged person
Note that the concept of "meta-elderly" was interesting.
>Some people are like meta-elderly people who just keep their position by hitting the [old people] as old people.

The concept of "old harm" is also a concept that demands an appropriate term because the typical example is often done by old people, some of whom are old but not old, and some of whom are young but old. (PS: see [Busy Harm])
I guess "[are] you producing something?" is the key cutoff.
Behaviors that do not produce anything or that get in the way of those who are trying to produce something are more likely to be considered "old".
