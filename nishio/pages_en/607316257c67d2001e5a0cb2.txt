	　When explaining what you want to do to someone who understands technology, don't look at articles on the Internet "for people who don't understand technology" and copy them.
	　Those articles don't tell the detailed story of "how it was accomplished." That's because "non-technical readers" don't want that information.
	　Instead, we use words (buzzwords) that even "non-technical readers" know and that have an air of new technology. The most popular word of the past few years has been "artificial intelligence.
	　I saw a proposal that said, "I will solve this problem with artificial intelligence! I saw a proposal that said, "Artificial Intelligence to solve this problem! That's amazing! I don't think, "Wow! I think, "How exactly is it going to do that?" I think, "How exactly is it going to be done?
