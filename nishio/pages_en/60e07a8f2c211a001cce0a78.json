　　Yellow hat Bright, positive, optimistic, hope and positive thinking

　In this book, it is translated as [parallel thinking], but is it the same as [horizontal thinking]?

　　　Horizontal thinking is "pattern transformation of asymmetric exchange systems."
　　　　>just as logical thinking is based on the principle of action in a symbolic language (a particular worldview).
　　　　>Horizontal thinking is based on the behavioral principles of pattern systems (also a particular worldview)
