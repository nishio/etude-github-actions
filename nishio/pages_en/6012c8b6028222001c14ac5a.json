　bottleneck elimination
　As graphene becomes plentiful, the bottleneck changes.
　PlaneFilter production speed is the bottleneck
　　This was the bottleneck when we first put it together, so we made this the only Tier 2 area.
　　I was unable to confirm this due to subsequent resource shortages, but now that I think about it, at first I could see the bottleneck in processing speed here due to the contribution of the buffer on the conveyor.
　　Twice as slow as its counterpart, even though the downstream requires the same number, I see.
　　Let's parallelize two of them.

　　Finally, one lab is no longer enough to make it, so we added
　The bottleneck in the whole thing right now is the creation of nanotubes for the purple cubes... I'm making them in a small corner, so I'll have to landfill and expand.
