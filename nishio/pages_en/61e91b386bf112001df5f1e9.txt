books to be chewed
>Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts,  others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly,  and with diligence and attention. --- Francis  Bacon. (1625). "Of  Studies"

I introduce the quote in [(4.1.1.6) Gradation between "Finding" and "Assembling"]

	[books to be tasted]
