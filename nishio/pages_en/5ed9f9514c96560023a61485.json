Meaning of a symbol is a set of vectors -> What is the operation of the meaning?
If the [meaning] of [symbol] is a [set] of [vector], what can be the [operation of meaning]?

　The [k-means method], for example, is an operation that turns [a set of vectors] into a set of vectors
　　The operation of simply averaging a set of vectors is equivalent to the k-means method with k=1
　　Ignoring differences between individual vectors and combining them into one = a kind of [abstraction
　[Projection]
　　It was said that [collapsing] the [axis] of the vector of meaning is an abstraction.
　　The same can be done for a set of vectors
　Find the distance
　　Given multiple sets of vectors, find the distance between them
　　This means applying [hierarchical clustering] to meanings
