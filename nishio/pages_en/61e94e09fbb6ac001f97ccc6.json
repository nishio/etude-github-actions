I've been slammed with time to present a demo for [Regroup] and go to [Unexplored Junior Shenzhen Tour 2019].
	In the beginning of a project that I have never worked on before, I find it interesting to think about how to proceed and create a system that is efficient, but by the time about 80% of the project is completed, the way of proceeding becomes stable and I lose interest in the project and move on to another one, Isn't this [a human bug]?
	If you have a disposition to find the unknown interesting, the unknowns will diminish at the end of the day, so "something unknown will happen after I finish this and release it!" Or should we think
	In addition, I was adding interesting things from the [Unexplored Junior Shenzhen Tour 2019] for "[the KJ method of "interesting"]" to a sticky note, and realized that the English translation project that was interesting for a few months at the beginning of the year is not so interesting now!
	Has the concern become a process rather than the subject itself?
	When I learn Chinese, I am interested in the "learning process" itself, not the Chinese language itself.

			[You get used to it, you get bored with it].
			The time costs involved are estimated to be large.
			→ Resulting in less motivation.
		There could be a deadline effect from the approaching deadline of "release by the end of this year."
			but it is better for your mental health to avoid such stressful methods if possible.
		Looking at the logs, it was around May 15 when we explicitly switched priority projects.
			1.6 as of 4/29, followed by 1.2 on 6/19.
	Partitioned the progress sheet.

		3/day ends 9/22; 1.5/day ends 10/11; 1/day ends 10/31.
			high, middle, and low ranking
			The goal was closer than I thought.
