I want to put Keichobot in context (with a secondary commentary)
I'd like to [put Keichobot in context], but it's going to be a lot of commentary to add, so I'll try to make it in the form of a secondary commentary (commentary as a third party in a conversation).
 It would be interesting to import this into Kozaneba

[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I want to put [/nishio/human.icon]Keichobot in context
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "[Keichobot]" is that "[Keichobot]"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Listen first.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Yes
[/nishio/human.icon]Groupware facilitated written [information distribution
[/nishio/kei.icon] "[Groupware]"
[/nishio/human.icon]However, it is only "[written information]" and this is the weak point of the current groupware.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Groupware"
[/nishio/human.icon]The problem is that "[a blur that cannot be put into words well]" in particular is not circulated until it is put into words. Because it is easy to see "what is put into words," it is misinterpreted as if it is the entirety of opinion.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"A blur that cannot be put into words well."
[/nishio/human.icon]It is often the responsibility of individuals to verbalize and transmit their moya-moya, but many individuals feel that they are not good at it. The advantage of an organization is to increase productivity as a whole by having those around you cover for the individual's unskillfulness.
　[nishio.icon][that if you attribute it to the individual, you can't improve it], so you should attribute it to the system and improve it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Moya Moya"
[/nishio/human.icon]The human-powered solution to this is "listening," and discussions of good listening methods have been held, with names such as "[listening]" and "[coaching].
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Listening"
[/nishio/human.icon]This can create a quality experience if the listeners are trained to "not impose their opinions," etc., but using [live people] is expensive.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Opinion"
[/nishio/human.icon]So replacing this with software, instead of losing quality, creates another advantage: you can use it whenever you want.
　[nishio.icon][strategy canvas] story, lowering some features of a product enhances others.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Benefits"
[/nishio/human.icon]For example, it can be used while taking a walk early in the morning, or while taking a bath late at night.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Early morning"
[/nishio/human.icon]It is based on [clean language], a coaching technique. In this method, the listener asks only questions and does not express his or her own opinion.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Listener"
[/nishio/human.icon] In this method, listeners are trained to use only the words used by the speaker and not to change them to other words based on their own interpretation. However, this is something that requires training for humans, who are prone to self-interpretation, but software is rather good at it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Listener"
[/nishio/human.icon]I was going to talk about how it works, but that's not the context, so we'll do that another time.
[/nishio/kei.icon] "Context"
[/nishio/human.icon]Oshimaa
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Listener"
[/nishio/human.icon]The End
[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[/nishio/human.icon]I want to organize about the context of Keichobot
[/nishio/kei.icon]What is the "context" of this "context"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Why were you born and why do we need you?
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > In this method, listeners are trained to use only the words used by the speaker and not to interpret them arbitrarily and change them to other words. However, this is something that requires training for humans, who are prone to interpretation, but software is rather good at it.
 What kind of "listener" is this "listener"?
[/nishio/human.icon]People who are not able to put their mumbo-jumbo into words, and when they hit on the words of others, they are influenced by them and prevent themselves from forming their own thoughts.
　[nishio.icon] You're being asked about the "listener" and you're answering about the "speaker."
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you value?
[/nishio/human.icon]That such people can put their moya-moya into words.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "[moyamoya]" is that "[moyamoya]"?
[/nishio/human.icon]A mass of "feelings" ([felt sense]) that have not yet been put into words that come from what the person has experienced.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > What such a person can do to put his/her bewilderment into words.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "blur"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Treasure trove, if it is covered by what is already in words, no moyamoya remains, so in the moyamoya lies knowledge that the organization has not yet acquired.
　[nishio.icon][Learning Organization], [Knowledge Acquisition in Organizations].
　　I think this is the first time that the clear [resource symbol] "[Moyamoya is a treasure trove]" that we have found value in verbalizing has been connected.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What is the relationship between that "word" and "moyamoya"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Can't tell others if it remains a blur.
[/nishio/kei.icon]How do you know its a "blur"?
[/nishio/human.icon]I can tell by feeling somewhat [uncomfortable] or unsettled.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > Can't tell others if it remains a blur
 What do you hope will happen regarding this "blurring"?
[/nishio/human.icon]When you can express that in words, you say, "Yes! This is what I wanted to say!" and you'll be happy.
　Like [nishio.icon][aha experience].
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "word" is that "word"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Things that express feelings
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > Can't tell others if it remains a blur
 Where does this "blurring" come from?
[/nishio/human.icon]Comes from personal experience
　[nishio.icon]So this is, in essence, born out of [the experience process].
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > When it can be expressed in words, you say, "Yes! This is what I wanted to say!" and you'll be happy!
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "word"?
[/nishio/human.icon]In order for the person to be able to express himself/herself and be happy, it is enough if the expression can be understood by the person himself/herself first, and the process of making it into an expression that others can also understand can be done after the "language that only the person can understand" has been created.
　[nishio.icon]This is about not having to [institutionalize the word] from the beginning. [Don't aim for perfection from the beginning].
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where is that "word"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Near the surface of the blur
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where is that "blur"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Well, maybe in the mind.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > In order for the person to be able to express himself/herself and be happy, it is enough if the expression is first understood by the person himself/herself, and the process of making it into an expression that others can understand can be done after the "language that only the person can understand" has been created.
 Where is this "word"?
[/nishio/human.icon]From the surface of the blur, "words that only the person can understand" emerge and are passed on to others. Whether or not others can accept or understand it is a relationship between the words and that other person, not something the narrator should worry about beforehand
　[nishio.icon][What the market judges] should not be judged by the creator.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is that "word" the same as "moyamoya"? Is it different?
[/nishio/human.icon]No. Words are born from mumbo-jumbo.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where is this "blur"?
[/nishio/human.icon]If you divide the mind into the surface and the deep, it's in the deep.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > No. Words are born from mumbo-jumbo.
 What does this "blur" look like?
[/nishio/human.icon]The sea, like the primordial sea in Mesopotamian mythology, is a sea of fertility, a sea that gives birth to many things, itself chaos, clean fresh water flowing into it, giving birth to diverse gods, which in turn shaped the world.
　[nishio.icon][Tiamat].
　>Tiamat, the primordial sea goddess in Mesopotamian mythology. She intermarried with the freshwater god Apsuu and gave birth to younger gods. For example, Tiamat produced the goddess Raham, who paired with the curly-haired male goddess Rahum to bring forth blessings, and these siblings produced Anushal and Kishal, the progenitors of the next generation of gods, and Anushal and Kishal produced new gods, the next generation of gods, including Anu, who later became the sky god. She is the symbol of chaos in the primordial creation...
  > After defeating Tiamat, Marduk took the "Book of Heaven's Life Version" from Kingu and applied Kingu's blood to the "creation of man" to shoulder the labor of the gods, while Tiamat's corpse was dismembered from its remains to be used as material for the "creation of heaven and earth". It is said that they were torn in two, each becoming the heavens and the earth, and that the breast became a mountain (and a spring was created near it), and from its eye arose the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates. Thus the mother god Tiamat became the basis of the world. [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ティアマト Tiamat - Wikipedia]
  The earlier connection with the resource symbol "moyamoya is a treasure trove" has changed the metaphor "ocean" to the resource symbol "sea of fertility."
  And combined with the historical metaphor of Mesopotamian mythology
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > No. Words are born from mumbo-jumbo.
 How do you know this "word"?
[/nishio/human.icon]You can tell by the way the words come out and it feels right.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where do these "words" come from?
[/nishio/human.icon]Words are acquired through learning with "institutionalized" meanings. However, when we are faced with "moyamoya" that cannot be explained in words, there are no appropriate institutionalized words to express the moyamoya. Therefore, existing words are used to express the new experience, and this is Eugene Gendlin's metaphorical creation of meaning.
　[nishio.icon]Here's a story about [institutionalized language], and then about [alliteration] and [Eugene Gendlin's metaphorical concept].
　　As for good stuttering, Scrapbox doesn't explain it very well, [the parable of the gears] and others are relevant. When a question is answered quickly, it's not so much the answer that matters, but the good stutter, the words spun after thinking for a while, that have value.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What happens to the "moya-moya" at that "word"?
[/nishio/human.icon]If the words and the fuzziness are "compared" and they feel right, the fuzziness is expressed in words and disappears. On the other hand, if the feeling of discomfort still remains, the fuzziness is broken down into smaller pieces by comparing the words and the fuzziness and digging into what is the same and what is different.
　[nishio.icon] "Collation" is an image of [direct collation
[/nishio/kei.icon]What is between that "word" and "blurred"?
[/nishio/human.icon](This is a difficult question...)
　[nishio.icon]This is exactly what a good thud looks like!
[/nishio/human.icon]Sometimes a probability spontaneously arises from a state of blur, but it is inefficient to leave it to luck and wait for it to happen. In Mesopotamian mythology, fresh water flows in, and in the case of my sea and fish metaphor, casting a net, or in the current implementation of Keichobot, the software is trying to increase the probability of words being produced from the moyamoya by asking clean questions
　[nishio.icon]The sea and fish metaphor compares verbalization to "catching fish in the sea".
　　[hook to fish out what has not yet been verbalized].
　　Here, the fish is hooked (the image of a harpoon with a string attached), but in the initial stage, the fish is not visible, so it is impossible to throw a harpoon at the fish. It is more appropriate to think of it as throwing a net in a fluffy manner. Throwing a harpoon has the nuance of "if it doesn't sting, it's an NG" and causes the false perception that the question must be answered. Test metaphor. Rather, there is a question, and even if you can't answer it, you get a hint that "there are no fish in this area right now.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What happens to the "word" during that "blur"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Words acquire new meaning
[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen regarding that "word"?
[/nishio/human.icon]It is not beneficial just to create new meanings for words or new meanings for words. It is like a child thinking of a cool special move name. It is beneficial when the [new combination] of created words and meanings brings about an economic benefit to the thought
　[nishio.icon][Thought economy] is what [Ernst Mach] was talking about, that concepts are created to lower the cost of thought. And when the created concept actually lowers the cost of thinking, it is economical and beneficial, then it is [pragmatistically] correct. There are opinions that look to foundation or consistency as a basis for correctness, but both are inappropriate here because we are creating a new combination of words and meanings.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What needs to happen to the "word" for that to happen?
[/nishio/human.icon]In the case of a word that is understood only by an individual, the use of the word as a tool for thinking needs to cause an increase in the efficiency of thinking. In the case of words that are used by multiple people, the words need to reduce the cost of communication. (Of course, it is preferable if this indirectly improves the efficiency of the organization's thinking and the thinking of individual members of the organization.
　[nishio.icon]This can be paraphrased as the economic benefits of thought
[/nishio/kei.icon]Can you do that with respect to "words"?
[/nishio/human.icon]This is a [challenge]. Some words will be, some will not. It is not something that "will" be, but some of the many that have been created "will" be. At least through repeated calibration meetings with Mr. Tachikawa, the phenomenon of the actual creation of that kind of thought-economy-like words has become an observable fact.
　[nishio.icon]This "becoming" is the story of ["becoming" and "making"] in [Introduction to Anti-Philosophy].
[/nishio/kei.icon]What does that "word" look like?
[/nishio/human.icon](Oh, I see, I wonder what it is, this is a very important question. I can't think of an answer right away, but if I could answer this, it would be a good way to end the day. My first thought was "this is exactly what the word is", but I don't think that says anything.
[/nishio/human.icon] I thought "like a cog". An explanation as to why it is a cog has yet to emerge, but that will come later.
