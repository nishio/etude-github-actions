resize with React+Paper.js
>data-paper-resize="true"

code:ts
 window.app.paper.project.view.onResize = () => {
   window.app.paper.project.view.center = center;
 }

I haven't done it yet, but I'll make sure to [save the previous CENTER when moving screens].
That way you can keep it centered when the canvas size changes as shown above.

[Paper.js]
