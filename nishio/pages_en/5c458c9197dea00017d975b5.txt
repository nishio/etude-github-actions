Make it good.
	The words "[good] make..."
		Making what you think is good, assuming it is "good" without considering what [others] think
		Making what others say is good, regardless of how you feel about it.
	Not very happy in the long run with either of the
		I made something that I thought was good and others said it was good.
		Improving what others think is good because I think I can make it even better
	seems to be a good cycle going around.
