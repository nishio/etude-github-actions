Let's call them "[fragmentary text]" and "[fragmentary relationship]."

It is difficult to suddenly output a network of relationships between many "fragmented sentences".
　So, the first step is to output the "fragmentary relationship" that says, "There is a relationship between this fragment and this fragment.
　When they come together, they create a large network after the fact.
