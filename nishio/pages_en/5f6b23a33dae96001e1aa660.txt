Put a spur-of-the-moment idea in Scrapbox
>[hyuki] YukiFor newsletters, web serials, books, etc., there is a flow of preparing sentences that will be used as materials, so we can use a fixed tool such as Outliner, and there is no inconvenience in managing them in a hierarchical structure. However, it is difficult to handle ideas that "pop into my head" when I am working on those projects. Scrapbox is a great place to store them.
	>Why do I have trouble dealing with ideas that pop into my head, often because they don't belong to any one project, they are fragmented, I feel like I've thought of something similar before, sometimes I want to write them down in association with a specific reference or image or formula.... ...and because I'm not sure of the conditions under which to organize it.
	>It is impossible to organize them systematically without knowing how to handle them, without knowing how they will eventually be organized, and without knowing what I might come up with in the future in relation to them. I feel that [Scrapbox] takes care of that quite well. A tool to organize without organizing.
