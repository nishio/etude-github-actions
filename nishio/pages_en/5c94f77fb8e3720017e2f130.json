Pi (3.1415926..)
I don't share your sense of finding beauty and mystery in the sequence of pi as "3.14..." I cannot sympathize with the feeling of finding beauty and mystery in the sequence of "3.14...".
The area of a circle is 3.14 times larger than the area of a square with the radius of the circle as one side.
The circumference of a circle is 3.14 times longer than its diameter.
On the other hand, [$ \pi / 4 = 0.785...] Using,
The area of a circle is 0.785 times larger than the area of the square circumscribed by the circle.
The length of the circumference of the circle is 0.785 times the length of the circumference of the square circumscribed by the circle.

I think the latter is more beautiful.

In the first place, decimal notation is merely a local rule due to the fact that earthlings are ten-fingered creatures.
Intelligent beings with 16 fingers naturally do not use decimal notation, so a sequence of numbers with pi in decimal notation is not universal.
The most universal notation is binary notation.
Moreover, when pi is written in binary notation, the sequence of bits is identical because 1/4 is just a 2-bit shift.

Note that the area of a polygon circumscribed by a circle is equal to the length of the perimeter of that polygon. This is beautiful.
