 @masui Serious version: draw two circles (radius 1), then draw a hexagon inscribed in one (half of the hexagon) to get the diameter, and from there draw a circle whose radius is that (length 2). Draw two circles whose radius is the distance (1) between the intersection of that circle and the first circle and its center. One of the intersections.ã€€It is hard to explain in a sentence.

 I had trouble reading the text and taking in the meaning for a while, so I drew a diagram.

 I see, I can show that the two isosceles triangles are similar and therefore pass through the midpoint.
