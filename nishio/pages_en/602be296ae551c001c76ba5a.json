Building a Tachikoma with LEGO6
Continuing from [Making Tachikoma with LEGO 4], this is a story about making Tachikoma again, which was first made in [Making Tachikoma with LEGO 1].
In 4, we made the top half and the carry, so this time we will make the legs.

I was happy to see that the mouth also moved (it didn't in 1) using the [divide 4 into 3] pattern, but compared to [original http://www2p.biglobe.ne.jp/~s-hf/toy/lego/legooli20.htm], 1 is closer.

　　I should have taken a picture in the same pose as the original.

At 1 it was [technique block 1 x 2 - pin hole 1] + [technique connector peg

　Mouth hole size 4 is closer to the original
　Doesn't look like it needs to be flipped on the peg.
　The length is a little shorter and closer to the original.

Also, I just realized that the original doesn't have [wedge plate 3x6] on the bottom, I assumed that's what both 1 and 4 were.

　Uh, the original is placed 1/2 pitch off.
　I didn't realize it because I assumed the bottom plate was the same shape.

Hmmm, the 1×3 tiles that underpin the legs are not connected to anywhere... a bit unsettling.

Next [Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 7].
