Worthy and unworthy arguments
	'There's no point in arguing about things that aren't worthwhile, so as soon as I'm offended, I'll correct or delete it.'
	I'm not comfortable paying the cost to fix it, so I'd like to just say, "Well, why is that? I want to make the other party bear the cost of explaining by replying, "Well, why? If the other party no longer feels annoyed and gets angry, then I don't have to pay the cost of dealing with the problem, and isn't that the best overall solution?
	"That would create [a hard-to-get-into character], but it's better to maintain [a hard-to-get-into character] and minimize the work cost I pay. It's more appropriate for me to maintain a state where advice is gathered."


	The higher you get, the rarer the advice.
		Young people find advice from older people annoying because it's not rare.
