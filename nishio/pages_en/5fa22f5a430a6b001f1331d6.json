 Thoughts.
 　The problem of making a [minimum global tree] with a rectangle of points.
 　It doesn't seem to make the whole area tree in the yang because there are 10^10 points.
 　[fill in from the end]
 　　The corner house can only be connected in two ways, so it should be connected in the smaller way.
 　　We do not lose generality if we consider this to be vertical.
 　　There are only two ways to connect again.
 　　　If this is below, the same argument is repeated recurrently
 　　If it is horizontal, then moving the path up does not change the cost.
 　　hmm
 　Consider [the Kruskal method].
 　　Select the shortest vertex and connect it.
 　　In this problem condition, all the roads connecting i and i+1 have the same cost
 　　Select one of the smallest vertical and horizontal costs
 　　　If you condense it all, you get a slightly smaller rectangle.

 　　　Repeat until you reach a point.
 　　　That means using all of them.
 　　　Sort p and q respectively [$ \sum_i p_i (H-i)].
 Official Explanation
 　I WA'd at the last step, I should have sorted them together and calculated them in order, because when I connected the verticals, the number of horizontal ones decreases.
