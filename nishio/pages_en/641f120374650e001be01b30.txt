Benefits of Scrapbox Collaborative Projects
from [join someone else's project in Scrapbox].
Less than two years later, look back and sort it out.

　Co-editing alone does not create value.
　　Lack of catalyst

　Some trigger will generate content of interest to multiple people in a collaborative editing project.
　　Content triggers action
　　It creates new content.
　　That's what triggers it.
　　Positive feedback occurs that
　　　chemical reaction

　Maybe [Scrapbox is] a lens that aggregates the interests of multiple people.
　 An abrupt metaphor
　 When a person is writing a sentence, the page comes to the top
　 　Happens in the "writing process" before completion.
　 　When another person opens the top page, they can see exactly what they are thinking and writing about right now.
　 Faster than thought chat
　 　Even the chat doesn't get shared until you write a line and hit enter.
　 　Close to voice conversation
　 Response can be immediate.
　 　In voice, you have to wait until the other person finishes speaking.
　 　Scrapbox conveys that you are looking there the moment you place the cursor on it.
　 　　If you put the cursor on an empty line, maybe write something.
　 　The moment you hit Ctrl+i, you can tell that you're trying to get a response back.
　 This is an example of a real-time interaction, but it can be far apart in time.
　 　What someone wrote three years ago can help you today.
　 　[Death Stranding]-like
　 　"What I've written or rewritten recently with interest comes up" thereby "attracting the interest of others there."
　 　On the other hand, no restraints.
　 　　Notifications do not fly.
　 　　Build a highway without restraint or obligation?
