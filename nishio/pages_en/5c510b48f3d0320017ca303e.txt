	A father in his 50s is a consultant who is rebelling against his college-age child's desire to become an actor.
	Playwright [Hisashi Konoue]'s comment
		There is a distinctive group of people who come to audition.
		Those "auditioning for the first time at age 30."
		I wanted to audition, but my parents were against it.
		I thought, "Now that I'm 30 years old, I'm going to live [my life], not my parents' opinion anymore.
