Ideas and scarcity value
[Ideas] and [rarity].
	Person A, who only rarely generates ideas, falsely believes that ideas have a high value.
	Person B, who generates a large number of ideas on a daily basis, believes that ideas themselves are not worth that much
 	Resources (e.g., your time) to realize the idea are overwhelmingly inadequate
  Ideas without resources are of little value.
  Select from many ideas those that you value highly and devote your resources (time, etc.) to them.
 The idea chosen by B is of higher quality than the idea chosen by A because it was selected from a large number of candidates.
 B is better able to identify the quality of ideas than A because B has more experience in selecting from a large number of potential ideas.
 Common Stories
	 A comes up with an idea and tells B that he thinks it has high value. For some reason, it is assumed that B will provide the resources to realize the idea.
	 B discards most of the ideas that do not involve resources.
	 A complains about his great idea being thrown away.
 If the person proposing the idea is also of the same type as B:
 	The act of communicating an idea is about as "maybe it will help" as you can get.
  If you have an idea, tell it anyway.
  The other party is not expected to use the resources.
  I'm not so much complaining about being thrown out.
  The act of discarding ideas is something I do every day.
 	So, if you are the type of person who proposes an idea and doesn't resource it and complains about throwing out ideas, you are type A.
 Is this some sort of [Dunning-Kruger effect]?

>B should show A how he is whisking away ideas on a daily basis.
Indeed!
