PAST2I
 If you know your opponent's ID, you know if you win or lose by a constant order of magnitude.
 So just queue up the first round winner ID and read it in the second round.
 While len(winner) > 2` since there is no need to do a final.
code:python
 def solve(N, AS):
     ranks = [1] * (2 ** N)
     winner = list(range(2 ** N))
     next_rank = 2
 
     while len(winner) > 2:
         next_winner = []
         for i in range(0, len(winner), 2):
             a = winner[i]
             b = winner[i + 1]
             if AS[a] > AS[b]:
                 next_winner.append(a)
                 ranks[a] = next_rank
             else:
                 next_winner.append(b)
                 ranks[b] = next_rank
         winner = next_winner
         next_rank += 1
     return ranks
