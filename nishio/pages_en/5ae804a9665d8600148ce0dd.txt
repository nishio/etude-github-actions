What the Crusher does
	1: Talking behind the backs of leaders and key members
 	Repeatedly, "where there is no fire, there is no smoke."
  Lowering the confidence of key members
 2: Lying
 	Repeatedly lie with impunity.
  Reduce trust in people who tell the truth.
ã€€3: Flattering Important People
 	Create a positive bias.
  This mischaracterizes the movement to exclude the crusher as an "equal fight" when it occurs.
	4: Swarming
 	Make a weakling a henchman.
  Be able to claim "I'm not the only one" when expressing an opinion.
	5: Creating an untouchable atmosphere
