 *1219883518*TOEIC results came back.
 It shows which position I am in for each ability. Listening is weak, and I am not good at guessing context from short conversations and picking out details properly from longer conversations. Reading is also poor at guessing context.
 
 
 What, you mean you can't read the air? (Oh!

 Oh, Amazon has TOEIC-related books categorized by level:

 I think I'll do a few more practice tests on the last book I bought, and if I don't make any more mistakes, I'll buy a new book.

 I heard id:higepon's advice of "making a timetable and studying" and set 23:00 as my study time, but I've been pretending not to look at it because I've been vague about "the scope of what I have to do on that day". I'm going to devote 30 minutes from 23:00 to continuous English training.

 Hachioji is filled in.
 
 While landslides are derailing the Keio Line and causing other terrible problems, Sumida Ward is not experiencing any thunderstorms or even rain. According to Tokyo Amesh, rain clouds over Hachioji have hardly moved in the past two hours. If it moves at this pace, it will be 3-4 hours before it reaches Sumida. I heard that Hachioji has been flooded above floor level. If this level of rain continues for 4 hours and passes through central Tokyo, the railroad network will be in a catastrophic state tomorrow morning.
 
 
 Oh, oh, here it comes. I thought I heard some sudden noise and then it started raining hard. @3:12
 
 It's like something sounding is slowly passing over it, but still, this isn't the main body, it's an outpost.

 I wonder what will happen when the main body arrives. Our stockpile of rice ran out yesterday, so we may not have anything to eat if we are trapped.
 
 
 Two servings of sbaghetti, two servings of udon, a cup of rice, a little less than a bag of rice cakes, several rice cakes, candy and sweets, etc. Hmmm, well, it looks like I won't die of hunger. This is assuming that the water and electricity are not cut off. In a situation like this, I think to myself, "Ah, I really need to stockpile food. If the electricity goes out, we will have to eat sweets. If the electricity runs out, we will have to eat rice cakes soaked in water.
