 *1328964626* I painted a picture of Liskov's substitution principle.
 >>
 Let q(x) be an attribute that is true for an object x of type T. If S is a derived type of T, then q(y) is true for object y of type S.

 The picture that if everything in the circle of T is in the circle of q(x), then everything in the circle of S is in the circle of q(x) if S is a derived type of T.
 
 Something so very natural, what's so natural about it? Some might think. So I also drew a picture of a case where Liskov's substitution principle is not satisfied.

 If S is a subtype of T, then it is natural for S to be contained within T. But if there is an element y of S that does not satisfy "true attribute q(x) with respect to object x of type T," then S is not contained within T. But if there is an element y of S that doesn't satisfy the "attribute q(x) that is true with respect to an object x of type T", then S doesn't fit inside T. This is the kind of unnatural situation where Liskov's substitution principle is not followed, he said.

 <BODY>I feel like it's hard to understand without concrete examples. <BR>Personally, I remember that it became clear in the example that neither "square extends rectangle" nor "rectangle extends square" would work. </body>
