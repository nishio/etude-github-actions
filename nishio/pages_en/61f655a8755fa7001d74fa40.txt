Fools are always bold
The fool is always bold. For just as the fool has no sense of caution, so the fool has no sense of shame for failure.

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Fools are always bold
The art of taking things on
lxxviii 

Fools rush in through the door. For fools are always bold. Folly is always bold. The same simplicity that robs folly of caution robs folly of a sense of shame for failure. But prudence enters more cautiously. Its antecedents are caution and care. They advance and see if they too can advance without danger. All forward thrusts are freed from danger by caution, but sometimes luck helps in such cases. Where it seems deep, proceed with caution. Wisdom advances cautiously, and prudence covers the ground. Now there are unexpected depths in the fellowship of men, so you must lead every step of the way.
