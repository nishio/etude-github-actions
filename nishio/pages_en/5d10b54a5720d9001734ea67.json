	Selection can be exported.
	Group them into one.
		If you select multiple objects without grouping, they will be output individually using the object name without specifying a name, so

Since it is SVG, it is easy to change the style programmatically.

code:ts
 export const LassoSVGButton = (props: any) => {
   const strokecolor = isActive(window.app.paperLassoTool) ? "#00C" : "#777";
   const strokewidth = isActive(window.app.paperLassoTool) ? "3" : "1";
   return (
     <svg onClick={props.onClick} viewBox="0 0 50 50">
       <rect x="5" y="5" width="40" height="40" rx="10"
         fill="none" stroke={strokecolor} stroke-width={strokewidth} stroke-dasharray="5 2"/>
     </svg>
   )
 }
