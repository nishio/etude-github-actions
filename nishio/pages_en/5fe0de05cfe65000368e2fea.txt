Rectangular section add
I want to add to a rectangular section of two-dimensional space and read it out in points.
　Alternative representation: given a set of rectangles and a point. We want the sum of the number/cost of rectangles containing points [PAST2N].

[one of the two dimensions is the time axis].
　sort add and read on one axis and time axis on the other
　　Range Add at one point and negative Range Add at another point.

	When RangeAdd and Read overlap at the same coordinates
		If the specification is "inside corners too":.
			The start RangeAdd must be processed before Read.
 　　End RangeAdd must be processed after Read
 　Shift the coordinates by 0.5
 	　Start RangeAdd: x -= 0.5
	 　End RangeAdd: x += 0.5
	When the range of x values is large, [Coordinate Compression] is required
	[RangeAdd can be achieved with two PointAdd
