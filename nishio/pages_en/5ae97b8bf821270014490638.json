Output Dimensions

 Methods of representation in two dimensions embed higher-order information in the brain into lower dimensions
  word2vec, for example, embeds the meaning of a word in a vector of several hundred dimensions.
  It would be in that higher state of the brain.
 It is fragmented and output by using the writing out method.
	In the KJ method,
  First lay out what you wrote down.
  	This is to force information to be embedded in a two-dimensional form that is easy for humans to observe and manipulate
  Next, we change the position so that the distance is well preserved in the higher dimensional space in the brain
   This is the group formation.
   Since it is moved while keeping the constraint that it is placed on a two-dimensional space, it remains two-dimensional.
  Bundle cards to have multiple different "[level of detail]" ref. [KJ method is pseudo-3D].
   In the era when the [KJ method] was born, there was no way to store or distribute with multiple [degrees of detail].

 Written expression is embedded in one dimension
 	[one-dimensional text].
 When people call bullet points two-dimensional, I feel that they are talking about something less dimensional. [Bullet points are not two-dimensional.]
 Bullet points are more flexible in structure than spoken utterances
  but it is the same kind of comparison between a one-dimensional array and a tree
  No denial of a more expressive structure.
  Same as [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis].
   Human thought is influenced by the expressive power of language as the tool he uses.
   Example in a programming language: ...
    People who have no experience with languages with higher-order functions have difficulty coming up with abstractions that pass functions as arguments.
