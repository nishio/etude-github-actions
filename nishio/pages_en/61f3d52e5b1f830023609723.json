Know how to take a hint.
Perhaps he's saying, "Make sure the information that's positive for you is credible, and accept the information that's negative for you.

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Know how to take a hint.

xxv 
It used to be an art to be able to banter, but now it is no longer enough. We must know how to take a hint. Especially when it comes to self-discipline. He who does not make himself intelligible cannot make himself intelligible. But on the other hand, there are those who call themselves fortune-tellers of the mind and lynxes of the will. The truths most relevant to us are only half-told, but if we pay attention, we can grasp their full meaning. If you hear something good, manage your credibility well; if you hear something bad, spur it on.
