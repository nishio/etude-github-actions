Sum of the number of subsets of a subset
The sum of the number of subsets of a subset of a set of size N is [$ 3^N]
　The number of subsets of a set of size k is [$ 2^k]
　How many subsets of size k are there in a set of size N → Combination of choosing k from N
　Using [binomial theorem] in reverse
　　[$ \sum_{k=0}^N \binom{N}{k} 2^k = \sum_{k=0}^N \binom{N}{k} 2^k 1^{N-k} = (2 + 1)^N= 3^N]
