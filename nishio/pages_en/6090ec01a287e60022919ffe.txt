 It's not an easy first step, so I decided to copy this first
 http://journal.mycom.co.jp/column/iphone/001/index.html
 
 I dragged the Bar Button to the view, but I couldn't drop it,
 I was able to drop it into something like Finder, so I thought this was it, but the button doesn't appear.
 I wondered why, but when I looked at the Button description, it said something like in UIToolbar, so I tried dragging and dropping the toolbar... it works!
 
 If you read carefully, the article said.

 By action sheets, you mean the ones that nu out from the bottom.
 
 <hr>
 
 I implement the code, run it, press the button, but nothing happens!
 
 >>
 I would like you to go back to Interface Builder and make the connection from the camera button.
 <<
 
 Mm, how?
 
 I wondered for a while where to drag it from the button, but I found a "showCameraSheet" in File Owner, so I dropped it onto the button.
 
 Hmmm. I press the button and nothing happens.
 
 <hr>
 
 Ahhhh, okay, only the view was not saved because I didn't press Cmd+S on the Interface Builder screen!

 At first glance, the game looks like Cololette, but upon closer inspection, it is not: it is for 2 to 5 players and contains 5 sets of cards with the same contents in different colors. Numbers 1~9 (only 4, 5, 6 are 2 cards), 3 H cards, 2 D cards, 1 F card.
 
 The deck contains cards with the same contents for everyone, but there is some element of luck in the choices since there are five of them in the hand. 1 card is drawn for each card played, and the game ends when everyone has no more cards in their hand. The person with the highest score per column takes that card, and the person with the highest number of cards wins.
 
 F card forbids changing columns OR collects one of your cards; D card removes the immediately preceding card; H card is equal to the greater value of the preceding and following cards; D card is equal to the greater value of the preceding and following cards; F card is equal to the greater value of the preceding and following cards.
 
 Hmm, I haven't played it yet, but it's basically a game where the cards are lined up face down on the field except that some of them are discarded face down due to the discard rule, so it may be rather important to read at the end of the game what cards your opponent has left.

 A game of "negative design."

 The puzzle consists of seven blocks, one each of The puzzle is to make a rectangle or a predetermined shape with these blocks. I tried a game that seems to be a predecessor to this one, but it is much more stripped down. The blocks are square, so they can be stacked three-dimensionally, but other than that, it's just a square tangram.

 The hardest problem (spoiler alert)

 A game that reads like Igo Shogi, with randomly initialized phases. There is no random element, except that the decision of the first or second move is made randomly by flipping the face-down cards. This would be a must-win for the first or second player if the initial placement is unlucky. There are only three options in each turn and they are decreasing rapidly.
 
 One cross chip (marker), two basic chips 1~7 and one 8, arranged in a 4x4 square. Markers allow the first player to move horizontally and the second player to move vertically, and to take the piece in the position where it moved.
 
 Oh, this is a beginner's level. No wonder it was too easy. In the advanced version, 1,2,3,8,9,9,10,-1,-1,-2,-2,-2,-3,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9,-10 are added and the size is expanded to 6x6.
 
 <hr>
 
 I tried to get all of the single player games to zero, but it says "you can always do it if you take your time" but I didn't need to take my time, I just reverted and rearranged the 12 pieces and said "this won't work because there are no zero pieces" and it was over easily. It's not good that the pieces are targeted. If you line them up in a way that doesn't break symmetry, that's the end of it. The state space is very small compared to someone who doesn't care about symmetry.
 
 <hr>
 I've tried the 6x6 game with humans, and it's a comfortable read, with 5 options each turn, and the reading gets deeper and deeper as it progresses, as it gets narrower and narrower as it progresses.
 
 <hr>
 The basic and additional chips are color coded black and white, but this is a poor design. The colors have been used for chip types that need to be distinguished only at the start of the game, and it is difficult to tell the difference between a negative 5 and a positive 5 from a small minus sign during play. For example, if I were to suggest a specific improvement, I would make the border of additional chips a double line and separate the color itself from the plus and minus chips.
