Length of breaks in the Pomodoro Technique
 Some people describe the [Pomodoro Technique] as a "25 minute work â†’ 5 minute rest cycle".
 This "five-minute break" is explicitly rejected in the 2010 [Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique
	I went into it in 2012 saying that it was spreading the wrong interpretation, but it just keeps spreading.

from [Leverage Memo: Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique](2012-11-11)
 Length of breaks
	 After writing this entry, I googled what others have written about Pomodoro and found that there seems to be a widespread misconception that "the rest period is five minutes," so I will quote from "Length of rest period" on p. 152.
		 >Should breaks be [timeboxed] as well? Will this prevent the taking of long, unscheduled breaks? The answer is no. Because you have to be mentally ready when you start your next pomodoro.
	 Before you become consumed with the practice of setting a "five-minute" break and starting the next task even if you are not ready when the time comes, you should ask yourself if that will allow you to "[maintain a] sustainable pace" and "[remain] productive. As noted at the beginning of this article, "[a]t most, eight pomodoros a day is realistic.
