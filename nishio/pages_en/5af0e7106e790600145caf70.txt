Isn't "learning organization" an anthropomorphic fallacy?
Isn't "[a] learning organization" a [fallacy of anthropomorphism]? There is no [Mr. Company].

What is "[learning]" in the first place?
　What is personal learning?
　How do we link that to [organizational learning]?
　I don't think "individuals within the organization are learning" is enough.
