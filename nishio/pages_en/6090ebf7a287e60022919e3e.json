 I was going to relax and sleep, but I can't escape if there is an earthquake now because two deliveries came and the package was so big that it blocked the front door.

 <a href="http://www.google.co.jp/codesearch?hl=ja&q=+package:http://ftp5.ru.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles/lincity-ng-1.0.3.tar. bz2+UNIVERSITY_TECH_MADE+show:2Wblys_OL8U:NdQZGanPM6c:c7g2H0GDAJI&sa=N&cd=1&ct=rc&cs_p=http://ftp5.ru.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ distfiles/lincity-ng-1.0.3.tar.bz2&cs_f=lincity-ng-1.0.3/src/lincity/lin-city.h">source</a>. Contrary to the help description, I thought it seemed more efficient to create many schools than to create a university.
 
 What I learned from reading the source. The increase in homelessness has nothing to do with unemployment. There is simply a lack of housing. Homeless people take resources without producing anything. The help says that one charcoal burner (Commune) can supply several potteries (Pottery), but Commune is coal +2, ore +6 and Pottery is coal -1, ore -11, goods +35. Not enough. When the farm is at full capacity (minus the technology and power bonuses) food +450, which is also the population that can be fed. But the working population is 45% of the total "housed" population. I haven't read up on whether the homeless are working or not, but I don't think they are.
 
 And, well, what we need in the end is Jobs, Goods for the school to raise the technology level (we want to keep it at 100% because the technology level is also the success rate of rocket launch), Jobs (labor), Goods (processed goods), Steel (steel) to build the rocket, and plenty of The rocket can be maintained even while it is being built. Rocket construction requires maintenance costs even while it is being built, so we want to complete it as quickly as possible. For this reason, we want to prepare plenty of materials. To produce steel, you need a steel mill (heavy industry), which needs to be supplied with lots of coal and ore, and to produce goodies, you need factories (light industry), which needs ore and steel, and to get ore... and for all of that, you need labor. It's hard to prepare these around the rocket and transport them without delay. Therefore, we chose the option of "building the rocket near the port and importing the steel and goodies. As long as we have plenty of money, the only thing we need to worry about is the supply of labor.
 
 It took me a long time to realize that there was also this "supply of labor", but in short, it is not "necessary to keep technical skills while building a rocket" to satisfy the constraints that "technical skills are needed to start building a rocket" and "high technical skills are needed when launching a rocket". As soon as they started building a rocket, they went around destroying schools in the surrounding area and put the labor power they saved there into rocket production. Also, we were flying rockets as soon as they were made, but it was inefficient because the population would increase while we were building the next rocket. We need to hoard rockets even if we have to pay for their maintenance and then send them off in batches when the population is over the limit. I think the realization of storing rockets was one of the reasons why I arrived at the option of destroying the school. In the past, rockets were flown as soon as they were made, so it was necessary to have a high level of technology at the time when the rockets were completed. As long as we stopped flying them immediately, we would no longer be bound by that constraint.
 
 It may look as if the project was completed easily, but it was not. However, it is impossible to build a dozen or so rockets, each of which costs 2 million yen, if you don't have enough money to spare.
 
 And well, that's how I cleared "Make the whole population travel by rocket". The other way to clear "Build a Sustainable Economy" seems to be difficult.
 
 -----
 
 The prices are the same for exports and imports, respectively: food: 1, coal: 50, ore: 1, goods: 3, steel: 100. Oh my. If there are unemployed people because there are too many jobs, this is not the case. But if there are enough goodies and unemployed people, then we should build schools.
 
 -----
 So, it was a mistake last time to grow huge to a maximum of about 15,000 people. 900 people, a small town within the confines of one fire station, maintaining 5 schools, and a surplus. Now that we can build a coal mine, we should be even more profitable in the future.
 
 -----
 I didn't time it, but when I came back from boiling tea, I was ready for heavy industry. We stopped selling ore and coal and processed it into steel before selling it.

 I got bored and crushed all the schools and stopped importing GOODS and left it alone.

 *1210415931*Processig.js != Processing
 -Drawing Programming in the Browser! Processing.js is now available! - IT Warfare http://d.hatena.ne.jp/amachang/20080509/1210355674
 
 The explanation is very gentle and wonderful, but I'm a little concerned about the bottom part.
 
 >>
  Overview of Processing.js
 
 First, let's talk about what Processing.js is.
 
 Processing.js is a JavaScript library that runs the Processing programming language in the browser.
 
 So what kind of programming language is Processing?
 
 What is Processing?
 
 Processing is a programming language for visual design with a Java-like syntax.
 
 A programming language for visual design sounds difficult, but it is actually very simple.
 <<
 
 Readers of this article will understand that "Processing.js is a port of Processing, a language (& integrated development environment) for visual design written in Java, and drawing functions that are also available in JS on the browser", right? Or, "I heard that an amazing JS library called Processing was developed. I heard that there is an amazing JS library called Processing that makes it easy to draw pictures like this.
 
 You could mention that Processing.js is just a port of some features of Processing (and some features are difficult to port), or at least link to Wikipedia.

 After I wrote that, I realized that I had already been plugged in the comments section.
 >>
 Recently, when I use Processing, I use Processing's video library to output lossless mov files, and use other mixers to create videos by combining music and other videos, but I did not know that JavaScript had a library that could reproduce Processing. I didn't know that JavaScript had a library that could reproduce Processing. I think ActionScript 3.0 also has a library that can reproduce Processing.
 ã€€The original Processing can use OpenGL, DV cameras, etc., can apply effects to videos, and can be linked with JRuby.
 <<
 Oh, I remember an entry about using the Processing library from Jython. Like this one: http://blog.kzfmix.com/entry/1208084871
