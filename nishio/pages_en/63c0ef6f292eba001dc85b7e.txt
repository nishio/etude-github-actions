The saying, "The goddess of fortune has only bangs," indicates that [chances] or [opportunities] to [seize] good fortune are limited. [GPT-4.icon][nishio.icon]
	Since the goddess only has bangs, you can't grab her hair after she passes by.
	In other words, it indicates that when good fortune comes your way, if you do not seize it immediately, the opportunity will be lost.
	This proverb tells us that it is important to take immediate action to take advantage of opportunities and good chances. The message is that when good fortune comes our way, we should not hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity.

GPT4 says the source is [" the epic poem "Aeneis" by the ancient Roman poet Publius Vergilius Malo (Virgil)], but it is doubtful[nishio.icon].
	>The phrase "[Fortune favours the bold]" is derived from the Latin idiom "Latin: audentes Fortuna adiuvat," "Fortuna audaces iuvat," "Fortuna audaces iuvat," etc., which have slightly different words but almost the same meaning. audentis Fortuna iuvat" and others. The last one in particular is used by Turnus, the antagonist in Vergilius' Aeneis.

　The nuances are similar.

GPT4 also mentions [Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit
	>Rouse your courage. Drive away sorrow and fear, for you will not be able to bear them. [* Surely the day will come when you will remember and rejoice in these sufferings as well."]

　Interesting that GPT4 associates this with this, but I think it's a bit of a distant association.
