Add headings to the transcription.
After reading [Mr. Tachikawa's Communication Theory], [Kinta Nakayama] pointed out that "if [headlines] were available at the right time," and I thought that was true.

Gather related items and headings.

Would it be nice to be able to import the results of the transcription into [electronic KJ method tool]?
