		>it was important to write without changing a single word at a time
		>it was important to copy verbatim
		I know the word "verbatim", but it seems too difficult for non-native readers
		I keep the original at this time. Any suggestions?
		>It is the same structure.
		>It therefore has the same structure.
		Need "therefore"?

		>finding common patterns from multiple units of concrete information
		How about: "multiple pieces of"
		I used the word "pieces" in chapter 5

		What's the difference between "expected" and "anticipated"?

		>That sample code will not directly tell you how to achieve your goal of outputting “Hello, (line break) world!”. Obviously,  it will be  a code to display something different. However, if you compare this new sample code with the information you collected so far, you will find another pattern, and you can create a new hypothesis about how to implement it to achieve your goal.
		I want to mean:
			The sample code will not satisfy your goal directly
				(The sample code = code which you find on the Internet)
				(your goal = outputting “Hello, (line break) world!”)
				The sample code is a code to display something different.
			However, if you compare this new sample code with the information you collected so far, you will find another pattern, and you can create a new hypothesis about how to implement it to achieve your goal.
				(This sentence looks too long, isn't it?)
		Moreover, how about to add a footnote as an example of "new sample code"
			Code to output "1(line break)2(line break)3" is `print "1\n2\n3"`
