How come no one noticed?
When someone notices something, the question made to that person is, "Why didn't anyone notice it?" question that is asked when someone notices something.
I was about to say, "I don't know," because there is no way I could have known why someone else didn't notice, but I thought that would not be a good answer, so I answered, "Maybe because you are an idiot. I once answered, "I don't know," but he was miffed because I thought that was not an answer.

I don't think the question "When I didn't notice something, 'why didn't I notice it?'" was even asked by the questioner. I thought the questioner did not even realize that the question "is often difficult to answer for no particular reason, so it is even more difficult to answer why someone else did not notice something.

I just realized that this may not be what the question is really about. For example, "Didn't someone else notice the same thing earlier?" And... no, this is another "I don't know". I don't know, so I'm saying I "thought of it," and I know the answer to that question before I even asked it. If the questioner knows the precedents, he can just say, "There are precedents like this," and the questioner probably doesn't know either.

Hmmm, I still don't understand the intent of the question. I guess [sometimes what looks like a question is not a question worth answering]. Should I have just said "I don't know" instead of trying to answer?

[Bad question]
[I think I've seen something similar in the past.]
