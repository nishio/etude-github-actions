Copy title with prefix
I was going to include existing private project pages in doing the [public to private transfer], but decided to keymark those pages ([toðŸ”’]).
So I decided to import the key mark and the project name as well as the page title.
code:python
 def copy_with_prefix(src, dst):
     r = export_from(src)
     pages = r.json()["pages"]
     for p in pages:
         p["title"] = f"ðŸ”’{src}/" + p["title"]
 
     write_pages(dst, pages)
