Roadmap-oriented and ecosystem-oriented
 The way programmers should study is changing.
  >Until about the 1990s, the IT industry had a long-term plan called "[roadmap].
   >It also encouraged planned skill development on the part of technicians.
   >Roadmap is a guideline for skill development
   >I have a feeling that those who have experienced this period still think about studying programmers as if they had this "roadmap".
  >The "Ecosystem" Era
   >Various types of players, who eat each other and live in harmony with each other, make individual decisions for their own sake, and technology develops through their interactions.
  >The "roadmap" is about reading their intent, but the "ecosystem" has no intent.
   >I am the one with the intent, and I cannot set policy until my intent is clear.
  >Normal people should go down the middle in the "roadmap" and avoid the middle in the "ecosystem"
   >The "ecosystem" is rather a "red ocean" in the center and a "blue ocean" on the periphery, where survival is easier. To take the high road in the "ecosystem," one must have extraordinary strengths that others do not have.
    It is a very eco-system philosophy to think that you should not be learning the same things as others, for example [a necessary condition for knowledge exchange].
	The roadmap, the ecosystem, and the environment in which we are placed are changing.
 	[average orientation is the worst environment].


 Two types.
  Avoid being stuck in one way of thinking by realizing
 It's not the roadmap orientation itself that makes sense, it's the understanding that "it used to be roadmap oriented, but that era is over, and now it's ecosystem oriented."
 Both roadmap-oriented and ecosystem-oriented have always existed, and their weights have shifted with the times.
 Default is the ecosystem
 It's a race at a time when the [S-curve] gradient of the technology is greater.
  Larger companies have a chance to win with a "control the surroundings by showing a roadmap" strategy.
  Get caught up in that success story.
  Continuing with the same strategy is not beneficial at a time when the S-curve is saturating

 > Great insight, by realizing that there are two kinds we can avoid getting caught up in one way of thinking or the other. Of course, understanding that "it used to be roadmap oriented, but that era is over and now it's ecosystem oriented" is itself stuck in the roadmap orientation. It is appropriate to understand that both roadmap-oriented and ecosystem-oriented have existed for a long time, and that their weight has shifted with the times. Perhaps the default is ecosystem, where the big companies have a chance to win with a "control the surroundings by showing a roadmap" strategy because it is a race when the slope of the technology S-curve is large. That continuing with the same strategy by getting caught up in that successful experience is not beneficial in a period when the S-curve is becoming saturated. I remember reading about 15 years ago that something similar was expressed in the phrase "[the] era of racing and the era of games.
