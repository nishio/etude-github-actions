Using Interval Iteration Methods for Machine Learning
	Metaphor for cramming learning
 	You're given a problem and an answer, and you cram it.
  Tests are given separately.
  This is what most [supervised learning] is now.
 Metaphor for [Interval Iteration Method
 	Daily learning is the test.
  Solve 100 questions in one session
  	Correct answers extend the interval between the next question by a factor of two.
   Repeat questions that were answered incorrectly.
   Mark 8 incorrect answers as unlearnable and remove them from the study.
   Difficulty is automatically adjusted.
   Datasets with too high a percentage of correct answers are boring.
   Datasets with too low a percentage of correct answers are painful.
	[Active learning in [machine learning].
 	Identifies data with no correct answer in the discriminator and assigns supervised data to those that are not confident in the identification results.
