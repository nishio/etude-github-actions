trigonometric inequality
[$ d(x, y) + d(y, z) \ge d(x, z)]

	Condition that the distance between x and z is less than or equal to "the sum of the distance between x and y and the distance between y and z".
	That "going directly from x to z is a shorter distance than going after a detour to y."
 It is valid with respect to physical distance.
 There are often cases in which it is not possible to establish a "distance metaphor" such as "[far] and [near]".
