Work and Labor
According to [Jun Kuikei
>[work] to do it with [spontaneity].
>[Labor] does it through [peer pressure].

Things that have developed a bit in my mind after a day.
	[voluntary] "[wanting to]" do [work].
 The "[should be] doing [labor]" that is done out of a sense of [obligation] or [peer pressure].

[What is work?]
