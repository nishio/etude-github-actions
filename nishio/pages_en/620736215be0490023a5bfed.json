Would you like to try your hand at clerical work?
A variety of qualities are needed, and knowing which ones are necessary is taxing and requires good discernment. Some require courage, others tact. Those that require mere precision are the easiest, and the most difficult are those that require cleverness. For the former, all one needs is personality; for the latter, attention and enthusiasm may not be enough. Controlling people is a tricky business, even more so for fools and morons. Those who have nothing need double discretion. It is intolerable to work at a fixed time and in a fixed routine that drives people crazy. Instead, it is better to allow people the freedom to act according to their own ideas, to combine variety and importance, and to refresh their minds by giving them change. The most reputable are those that are least or farthest dependent on others; the worst are those that are worrisome both here and in the future.
