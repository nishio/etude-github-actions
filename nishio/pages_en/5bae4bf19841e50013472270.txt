Collecting quotes on Twitter
	I thought it would be a good idea to collect the results of a Twitter search for "[quote]" to feed the [chatbot].
	The actual search.
 	Accounts that Tweet about things that are not good.
  Accounts that can be used in a clean form as tweeted.
  Accounts with trash on front and back.
 Need to filter by account and remove debris
 But it seems to make more sense to have a system that puts in books and converts them to data than to use such a garbage-laden input source.
 Even if you wanted to "feed on a multitude of quotes," it would be better to use a book of quotes, because it would have a better format and be easier to handle mechanically.

Relatively well-formatted accounts

I thought there might be a website, and there is.

 	Individual quote pages e.g.: https://meigennavi.net/word/186/186400.htm

   There are key words for each quote.
