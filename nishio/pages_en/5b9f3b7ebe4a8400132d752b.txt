Graveyard of dead documents
If a document that is not going to be updated in the future is a [dead document], then a document that is not going to be updated in the future would be placed in a [graveyard].
If "[completed]" means that it is no longer necessary to update it, then the blog where the completed text is placed is a graveyard of dead documents.
