Least cost flow is a linear programming problem
[Minimal Cost Flow] is a [linear programming problem].
minimize
	[$ \sum_{(i,j)\in E} c_{ij} x_{ij}]
subject to
	[$ 0 \le x_{ij} \le u_{ij}]
	[$ \sum_i x_{ik} - \sum_j x_{kj} = b_k \quad (\forall k \in V)]
where
	c: cost
	x: flow
	u: capacity
	b: Supply and demand
	ã€€Special form with one positive vertex and one negative vertex if the start and goal are such that there is one point
