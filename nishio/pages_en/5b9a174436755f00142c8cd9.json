Reinforcement Learning and Dimensionality Reduction
	[dimensionality reduction]
	[Dimensionality reduction is an abstraction].
 There is no objective reason for choosing which axis to crush.
 	[Abstraction is subjective.]
	Then it's not as if you randomly select an axis.
 If there is something to be gained as a result of choosing the appropriate axis of abstraction, then choosing that axis is reinforced.
 	In other words [reinforcement learning].
  Which axis to choose [multi-armed bandit].
