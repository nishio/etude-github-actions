Bias-ridden simple comparison
>[https://twitter.com/ManpukuYuichi/status/1563488067981570048 @ManpukuYuichi]: @MIKITO_777 I just got the vaccination history of the 7th wave of deaths in Osaka.
>The proportion of unvaccinated among the deaths is 16.5%. In Osaka Prefecture, the percentage of the population that has never been vaccinated is 21.8%.
>Who is it? Who was the one who was spreading the false rumor that most of the deaths and serious injuries were among the unvaccinated!
>Don't tell lies that are so easy to catch.

>There are very few elderly people who are at extremely high risk of death who have not been vaccinated.
>Yet 16.5% of the deaths are due to unvaccinated people, which shows how dangerous unvaccinated people are.
>Simple bias-ridden comparisons that are not age-adjusted are meaningless.

[Funny statistic].
