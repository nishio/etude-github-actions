Assume a homogeneous group of people
When there is a group S of people, I interpret the characteristics that I observed that element X had as if the whole group S had them [idea].
For the most part, this is just a misunderstanding, since groups of people are rarely homogeneous

	I hired a consultant and he came in not good, the consultant is not good.
		For example, if you're a new client and it's not important to continue doing business with you in the future, it's reasonable to use your business as a test bed to train younger people and experiment with high-risk methods.
		It is merely a mirror reflection of your business not being good enough.
	My former consulting colleague X is not good, consulting is not good.
		It's not clear why that X left the consulting firm, but with the "[Up or Out]" (promote or quit) personnel system, there are a lot of cases where people who didn't get promoted leave.
		I think what you are observing is someone who "didn't stay behind".
