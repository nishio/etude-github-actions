>Humans have an ability that is not logical, but something akin to a sense of smell, and this ability is far ahead of reason in sniffing out information that is likely to be necessary. In contrast, rational judgment is supposed to confirm whether the information found by this [olfactory] faculty is really useful or not. If we compare it to the marching of an army, the former is the [scout] and the latter is the main body. The fact that the information provided by the scouts is often erroneous and lacks precision is not an argument against the uselessness of the scouts. If the main body marches naked without scouts, it will be defeated when the enemy takes it by surprise.
