The last time I did this was a whopping 12 years ago.

　Expansion is when "Conspiracy" and "Seaside" are out and "Alchemy" is not out yet.

According to [https://youtu.be/eTCDRhcxDdc strong man]([Nagadon]), since the expansion "Adventure", the card power has increased and the value of the silver coin has decreased because of it.
　Then in 2010, there were a lot of cases where [Stero] had the advantage.
　　I didn't know the term "stero" at the time, but I remember being excited when I heard that the right thing to do was to buy silver coins in many cases, even though there were lots of action cards!
　Now that the card power is stronger and the balance has been adjusted to be more competitive between steroids and combos, it's going to be more important to look at the supply and decide which side of the field is better suited.
