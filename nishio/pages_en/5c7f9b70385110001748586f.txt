air battle
A sterile conversation discussing using [abstract concepts] that are not [grounded] [floating] [in the air].
Neither of us knows what the other is saying, but neither of us can say "I don't know".
What [specifically] do you mean by AI?" and [question].

Even if you don't understand, pretend you do and continue the conversation.
Why can't they just say, "I don't know," because they think it's a [shame].
Rather than having [an understandable discussion], I believe that if the conversation ends without the "I don't understand" being revealed, it will pass.
