 *1198024508*Sleepy
 I fell asleep in the bath I took to wake up.
 
 *1198028818*Late.
 
 The Hanzomon Line schedule was in disarray, and when I went to call to let them know I would be late, I was dismayed to find that I had forgotten my cell phone itself.

 I saw "Keihanna" in kanji for the first time.
 <<
 
 When I write "Keihanna" in hiragana, I have a (selfish) image of the area where the National Diet Library and ATR are located.
 I was actually going to say Keihanshin, but I have an image that there are more people involved in Nara than Kobe.
 
 *1198035386*MediaWiki
 That's a very high functionality.
 
 Like, "recently updated pages" spits out RSS.
 http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:Recentchanges
 
 I hear it comes with access statistics.
 http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:Statistics
 
 Also, the "category list" was empty and all the pages were in the "uncategorized pages," so maybe it was a mistake to introduce the namespace "1000speakers" and categories should be introduced.

 *1198039413* Reversal of priorities

 The problems encountered on the Mars Pathfinder are a classic example of inverted priorities in a real-time system
 <<
 
 Okay, let's say that my machine is always on and sends a message to some server every 10 minutes, and if the regular report stops for 20 minutes, the machine sends a message to my cell phone saying that the machine is hung. Then, task X is given the highest priority for sending this report. Suppose that I have another program Y running that does some kind of calculation and writes out the results when the machine is idle. This program is run at a low priority. And, let's assume that watching DVDs is a medium priority program.
 Then, if the moment I happen to think, "Let's watch a DVD," is the very moment when Y completes the calculation and applies a lock to write out the result, DVD playback will take priority over Y's writing out the information. And X, which has a higher priority, is blocked because it cannot acquire the lock to read the information. As a result, when you are watching the DVD, for some reason, you will receive a text message on your cell phone saying that the machine is hung up.
 In this example, it is only a matter of receiving an e-mail saying that the system hung even though it did not hang, but a system like Mars Pathfinder, which cannot be reset by humans when it hangs, has a "watchdog timer" that resets when there is no regular report, just in case. If my computer had a watchdog timer, I would be sadly surprised if it somehow got reset while I was watching a DVD, and all the calculation results would be lost.

 Multitasking is so difficult!
 
 *1198068411*MyMiniCity
 A site where the city grows as people visit.
 http://nishio.myminicity.com/
 I made it as soon as possible.
 
 But no editing capabilities?
 I am not interested unless I can do something creative, like building with the accumulated points.
 
 ----
 
 Now there is only one house standing. @21:47
 
 ----
 
 I got bored quickly because there was no change.
 
 I put it in the IMG tag.
 
 # I turned it off because it was pointless.
 
 ----
 
 Now at 1823rd @ 22:00
 I'm not surprised, but it doesn't seem to increase even if I hit F5 repeatedly. So I wonder if it's judging by IP address.
 amachang said "maybe SharedObject because it's Flash", but if I were to make this, I would count on a lower layer, not Flash.
 
 ----
 
 Now in 1109th place @ 22:31
 I wrote a program in Python to access the site while switching proxies, but it doesn't work, because it doesn't increase when I open it in IE, so I thought it would be IP-based.
 
 ----
 
 There is nothing like that in the Application Data℠Macromedia℠Flash Player℠#SharedObjects.
 
 ----
 
 I set up a proxy and accessed the page with IE and it properly increased to 2 people. So I think they are counting access to something that is not a page while filtering on an IP basis. But I don't think it's access to Flash. Because the Flash URL is http://data.myminicity.com/swf/client.swfだから.
 
 *1198088955* and for now.
 Today is the day I'm going to bed at an earlier time1!
 
 *1198089248*call/cc
 to id:amachang
 I'm talking about today's "does the first one always execute the continuation?" but if you do it like (if x (f x) x) and call/cc the first x and pass in a function that returns #f, then "the continuation is executed" but f is not called. If the actual processing is in f, then it's practically as close to "exit without executing the continuation" as I wanted to do.
 
 I wonder how Scheme-like it is to use an argument that can also be #f. I would wrap it like '(arg)' and then use it after (car x). If it were me, I would wrap it with '(arg)' and use it after (car x) when I use it.

 <body>This is a multitasking or real-time problem. <BR>In this example, when the task of DVD playback is waiting for IO, task Y with a lower priority will be executed, so task X will not be executed until DVD playback is finished. <br>The difficulty in real-time task management lies in the strict time constraints. <br>This example may not be very clear. </body>.
