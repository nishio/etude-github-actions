Not being emotionally repulsed by something you don't understand.
They don't want to acknowledge the observation that they "don't understand," so they get emotional, ignore it, or assume it's bad.

As a child, the world must have been full of things we don't understand, but when we grow up and learn to understand some things, we forget that the world is full of things we don't understand by "locking ourselves away in a place surrounded by things we do understand".

It would be good to take a little "unknown" each year before it becomes serious.
