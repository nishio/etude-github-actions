terminate
To terminate. Used in the form of "terminating an instance", especially in EC2, etc.

There is an idiomatically shorter expression about terminating biological instances of Homo sapiens, but because some Homo sapiens are emotionally repulsed by the expression, or because it is used by some Homo sapiens who have become emotional, the use of the word has led to social networking accounts and other terminations, making the word difficult to use in calm discussions.

Termination from the organization is also terminated because it "terminates an unnecessary social instance in the organization".
