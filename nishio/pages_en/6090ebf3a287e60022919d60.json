 I wonder if putting it in the subject would make it a headline.
 
 *1191494240* Blog mode
 
 Even if in blog mode, is editing on a daily basis?
 
 *1191494241* Make the diary title a link to the top page of the diary.
 
 The top page of "XX's Diary" was not linked to the top page, so I modified it.
 I know I can just press "latest diary" or something, but it's small.
 
 (PS: There was an option to make it a link. Thanks for letting me know! >yoshiori)

 *1191494242* Where is the Hatena Diary submission API?
 
 I've looked but can't find it.
 
 The reason I said "even if in blog mode, is editing on a daily basis?" is because I thought that if there is a "new entry post" we could just mimic what it sends.
 
 Try *1191492271*d2.hatena

 I see, you are doing a lot of things in HatenaStar.js.
 First, visit http://d2.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/?mode=jsonにアクセスしてrkmを取得して,
 You can find it at http://d2.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20071004/1191492631にtitleやbodyと一緒にPOSTすればいいのか.
 I am not sure how this POST destination URL is determined. The first half is a date, but the second half seems to be an ID that includes people other than myself.
 
 Okay, seconds from the epoch in UTC.
 
 Maybe in another 30 minutes I can write some code to post from Python or something, but I have an 8pm meeting with my sync today, so btw!

 I wish I could identify the article I posted from my cell phone after the fact. This is from my cell phone.

 After all, this was simply a string appended to the end. Ummm, it is difficult to handle.
