KJ-method in a text editor
The [KJ method] has a prominent appearance of using [sticky notes], but it is only a prominent appearance.
The essential [grouping] process is not much different from the process of "writing one item and one line of what comes to mind in [outline processor], then moving it up and down so that strongly related items are close together. Would it be easier to explain the two in parallel?

As a thought experiment, what would I do if I had no pens or sticky notes, only a text editor, and I wanted to do something KJ-legal?
First, write a series of short sentences in a text editor, one line at a time, then pair the lines as you go along, and when you have gathered some, add a title, copy and paste just the title, and repeat.

  1 Write down
  2 Create a blank area by putting a line break in the front and sending it to the bottom.
  3 4 Make pairs and move them to a blank piece of paper.
  5 Repeat
  6 Finally, everything will be grouped together.
  7 Put a nameplate on the group
  8 Send it down with a new line, copy and paste only the front cover and collect it in the blank area.
  Back to 1.

What's harder with this than with sticky notes.
	It's hard to display 100 items in the missing direction.
	What to do when you want to express something that cannot be expressed well in words in a diagram?
