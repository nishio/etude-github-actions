It's okay to feel uncomfortable.

The example of "[I feel something strange]" has also existed for a long time. In the postwar period, examples include Shiina Rinzo, Mishima Yukio, Umezaki Haruo, Agawa Hiroyuki, Ishizaka Yojiro, Sato Haruo, and Endo Shusaku. These are expressions that have met the approval of many great writers, so there is no need to be nervous about them.
