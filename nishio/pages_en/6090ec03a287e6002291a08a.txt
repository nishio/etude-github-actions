 *1270010188* Estimate of condominium purchase
 I've been studying a lot recently and I think I've learned a lot, so I'll do a trial calculation and ask someone who knows more about it if I'm right or not.
 
 <a href='http://suumo.jp/tokushu/single_dinks/mansion_kanto/kiji/vol_17/hensai_2.html'>What do two sets of DINKS have in common? |SUUMO</a
 A loan of 25 million yen means 750,000 yen per year in interest, assuming the interest rate on the loan is 3%. 75 * 7 / 2 is roughly 2.8 million since the loan was repaid in 7 years. I don't know if it is a full loan or a down payment, and I think it is the latter, but I don't know how much it is, so I assume it is the former, and property tax and city planning tax are 1.7% in total, which is roughly 500,000 yen per year. Since it says "I bought it new in 1996 and sold it this year," it means I bought it new and sold it as a used house of 14 years old, which is roughly less than half of the price, so the loss on price decline is 12.5 million yen. The total of all the losses is about 22 million, which is almost the same as the original price of the property. If you take this 22 million and put it into 14 years, it comes out to 130,000 per month. Therefore, if the rent was higher than 130,000 when renting a similar property, it would be a good deal. The monthly repayment is about 75,000 yen, which is about the same as the rent. If we assume that the "*" indicates the rent price of a similar property, you are wasting 55,000 yen per month, which is 660,000 yen per year, or 9,200,000 yen over 14 years.
 
 He writes, "I am not the type to waste money (laughs). I left 1 million yen for emergencies and paid back the rest as soon as I could save it." He writes, "Buying a new condominium was already a considerable waste of money, and there may have just been no room for further waste. I don't have enough information to make a more accurate calculation, so I'll leave it at this.

 Assuming that there is no loss in value of the property at all, the amount of property that cash flow from interest plus taxes of about 5% each would balance the 80,000 monthly rent is 19.2 million. Surprisingly high. Of course, the entire loan is still outstanding, but it can be paid off in full since the property has not dropped in value. In fact, the property will drop in value, so if you buy a 20 million property and pay 80,000 per month of "rent-like interest and taxes," you will be left with a loan equal to the drop in value of the property.

 Terrible, the way it's pieced together and the lyrics are terrible on the web.
 
 I was fishing for a video by the same author.

 It's a very natural connection. And the lyrics are terrible WW, I hope you don't wake up to that stuff.

 <body>I'm not sure since the link is 404, but if you bought it in '96, property tax (and city planning tax) should not cost that much since there should have been some sort of preferential treatment. 100,000 +/-, I think. <br>That's a minor detail. </body>

 <BODY>An apartment would cost another 10,000-30,000 yen/month in administrative fees. Rentals are likely to have a separate renewal fee, so you may want to consider it as an offset</body>.

 <body>Property taxes are much lower for residential use, so it's probably not more than $200,000 per year, that's about the price. </body>
