 **12222430037*[Mid-term limit]Explanation of the rules for the mid-term limit.
 Saikyunin is a card game played by three players.

 The reason why I posted only the record of the game without rules explanation in <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20080918/1221763717">Flying Diary</a> was that I intended to post it right after the presentation at the Young Scientists' Meeting of Information Science. But after the presentation, I realized that I had to put it on the web. However, after the presentation, I realized that it is confusing to listen to the explanation of the rules without following the flow of the game, so it took me some time to fix that. Thanks for your patience > id:sshi
 
 *12222433005*Verilog Diary
 I've installed Xilinx ModelSim XE III/Starter 6.3c, copied and pasted the appropriate Verilog code, compiled it, and even simulated it, but I'm not sure where to look to see the results. I guess I need to watch someone working on it from behind or something.
 
 *1222446757*I'm not sure how to use gprof
 Moo.

 $ g++ -pg -O3 -I/opt/local/include/ saichugen.cpp
 $ ./a.out
 $ ls # gmon.out is created here.
 $ gprof | less

 I did this, but even main only shows 0.0 like this. What is wrong?

 <body>>>mogos<br>Oops, you are right, I will fix that. <br><br>sshi<br>The strategy and such in the early rounds is a situation that hasn't been figured out yet at all. The final round can be read off in 4 seconds, but it takes 20 minutes to read off the 4th round, and the number of states explodes. </body>

 <body>It could be because the program is terminating early, or because you have <br>optimization options. </body>

 <BODY>I was in a circle in college for a card game called Contract Bridge, and there were sometimes people who could remember about 52 cards x 24 games in the order they were played. (I was not good at all, though.) Therefore, duh to "People don't remember cards very well" on page 45. </body>
