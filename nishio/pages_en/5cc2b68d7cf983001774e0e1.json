		But agreement on cases is not agreement on boundaries.

	Let's clarify boundaries to improve, you might think.
		There may be no clear boundaries to begin with: [false dichotomy].
		Maybe we should define an [axis] and discuss the [continuous value] of "strong/weak characteristics" along that axis.

[indistinct]
