 *1264772484* I read "The Magical Crucible that Produces Mathematics".
 I read the donated book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4873114365?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& creativeASIN=4873114365">A Magical Crucible for Producing Mathematics &#8212;An Invitation to Experimental Mathematics</a>, which I read. This is interesting. First of all, I don't have a clear idea of what experimental mathematics is, but for example, it was in 1792 that Gauss studied the distribution density of prime numbers and found it to be the inverse of log. More than 100 years later, the approximate formula was proven to be correct. He also discovered that the value of convergence of a simple gradual equation coincided with the value of an integral, and although he could not explain the reason, it led to the theory of elliptic modular functions in the 19th century. This is experimental mathematics.
 
 When Riemann published the Riemann forecast in 1859, he did not write in his paper why he made the forecast, but from the calculation paper Riemann used, which was donated to the University of Goettingen, it can be read that he found it by doing numerical calculations.
 
 When I first started using Python, I was so excited about having integers with no upper limit that I tried to enumerate numbers that were both a Fibonacci sequence and a square number, and numbers that were both a Fibonacci sequence and a cubic number. Surprisingly, the third one did not output no matter how long it took. I didn't write it down when I looked it up on Mathworld at the time, but now I see that it says that it was proved in 1989 that there are only two cubic Fibonacci numbers. <a href='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FibonacciNumber.html'>Fibonacci Number -- from Wolfram MathWorld</a>
 
 So it's like that, experimental mathematics is where you might discover surprising results. The computer has made it very easy to do.

 Have you gained weight?

 <body>Lately at work, when I have enough machine power, I have been searching for Nob numbers. <br>I wrote the search code in C++ and it overflowed a long long int in an hour, so I use python code to search. </body>

 <body>Kawai-san also looks big, so I guess he must be shooting with a fisheye. </body>
