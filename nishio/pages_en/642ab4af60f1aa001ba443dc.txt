Young people who don't flirt with authority and those who are emotional.
There is a person A.
	A flicks [authority] at young man B
	A expects young man B to flirt [wag his tail] with authority
	But young man B [does not flirt].

Some A's get angry at this time.
	If A gets angry, it only makes the young man B's side don't get angry, but it doesn't make B flirt with A.
	No purpose is served by anger, but people who don't even know it are just acting emotionally!

A does not understand that "competent young people tend not to flirt with authority" in the first place
	Competent young people have high [self-esteem].
	Therefore, when they see others acting authoritatively, they do not consider "their side inferior" because

If A was once a "competent young person" or had the opportunity to observe "competent young people" around him or her, he or she would understand this as self-evident
	So it is clear that A is not such a person

I think B should mute A.
