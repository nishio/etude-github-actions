Parable of the eye shield
Why do we want diversity at any cost? It is because the benefits of expanding the organization's vision through diversity outweigh the costs. Horses in horse racing wear eye shields on their faces that allow them to see only what is in front of them. When the objective is to run a given course as quickly as possible, it is easier to concentrate if they cannot see their surroundings. But if you go out into the field in that state, you are in danger. Which is the current state of [the organization]?

The strategy that worked best when you are trying to go the fastest on a given course toward a given goal is no guarantee that it will work best in other situations. Limiting your field of vision when you are roaming around in the field looking for the best grass can be counterproductive.
