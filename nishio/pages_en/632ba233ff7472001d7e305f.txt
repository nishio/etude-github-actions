Even veterans are in the dark all the time.
>[https://twitter.com/wanpowanwan/status/1572425349031690243?s=21&t=dDnBm_U2ClhBaRvyhytVyg @WANPOWANWAN]: there was an event that reminded me of my own rookie days.
>It's been almost 40 years since my debut and I still don't know how to draw comics.
>I am writing this in the hope that it will reach all the newcomers.
>[It's okay to fail].
>I am only accumulating 40 years of reflection.
>You just need to draw and paint and reflect on it. →
>> I once asked Tetsuya Chiba to publish a textbook on manga.
> "I don't know, it's too hard to cartoon," came the answer.
> When I met with Takumi Nagayasu-sensei, he told me, "I think I have finally learned how to use the G-pen recently.
> This is all. > > > This is all.
>> No matter how [experienced] you are, you are always in the dark.
> Perhaps [there are] no answers, no perfection or completion] work.
> What there is is [a landing place of compromise].
> Popular writers who are considered successful then take the fight to the great men of history.
> But I am always impressed by young people who are able to use the latest tools and even produce their own products. →>
>> There is no end in sight and it is impossible to keep winning.
> By the time you think you've got something, it's lifespan.
> To begin with, comics are not something shallow that can be mastered in one or two lifetimes of a person's life.
> We live to lose.
> So it's okay to lose.
> It is ok to fail.
> Please draw more and more without fear of anything. > > > Don't be afraid of anything, just keep on drawing.
> Please draw a lot of pictures while reflecting a lot in order to get the word "interesting".
> Please keep yourself out in the open.
> No regrets.
> [What is needed is] reflection and a fun study.
> Good luck.
> 
> People's opinions change, so this is my opinion as of now.
> Sorry if I say something different in years to come.
