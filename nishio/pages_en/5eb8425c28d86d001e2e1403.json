　When we say, "If you increase X, Y will also increase," we are implicitly thinking in terms of two choices: increase/no increase.
　However, when considering the amount of increase, even if "if you increase X, Y will also increase" is true, there are cases where the increase is not as great as expected.
　Whether the amount of increase is 0 or not, it's not 0, so it's "increased".
　Suppose you fill a lake with a glass of water. If you say that the surface of the water does not rise, you are mistaken; if you say that it does, you are foolish" [Parable of the Lake and the Cup].
