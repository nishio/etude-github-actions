 *1335008350*Experiment with capturing A4 size documents in SHOT NOTE
 When I went to MUJI today, they were selling a schedule book with markers on the four corners and a smart phone to capture it, just like SHOT NOTE. Oh, KING JIM, didn't you patent that?
 
 So, in my case, I draw notes and mind maps on A4 printer paper or A3 croquis books, which are heavy to carry around, so I want to digitize them.
 
 So I enlarged the marker to A3 size and put an A4 document on it and took a picture.

 The SHOT NOTE app recognized it properly, but unfortunately it seems to adjust the white balance assuming that the notes were handwritten on a small memo.

 I wish the white balance could slide like the recent iPad commercials.
