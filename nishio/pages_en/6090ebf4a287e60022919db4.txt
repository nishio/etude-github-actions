 *1198903510* Cytokine Storm
 >>
 Excessive production of cytokines (called a cytokine storm) is lethal and is considered a cause of death from Spanish flu and trifluenza. In this case, cytokines are produced as a defense response to infection by the immune system, but excessive levels cause airway obstruction and multiple organ failure (similar to an allergic reaction). In these diseases, the active immune system leads to overproduction of cytokines, which may make young, healthy individuals more susceptible.

 The story says that if you think it is the elderly who die from bird flu, you are wrong. The thousands to tens of thousands of deaths a year from ordinary influenza are usually the physically weak elderly and young children, but the process that leads to death is different for avian influenza.

 -- Higher incidence in healthy young people
 - SARS releases the virus after the onset of fever, but avian influenza releases it before there are any subjective symptoms. When a bird flu outbreak is confirmed overseas and makes the news, there is a possibility that it has already entered the country (Tokyo, for example, should be assumed to have already entered the country).
 - If you are stockpiling food for earthquakes, you can stockpile food until relief supplies start arriving (often referred to as a three-day supply), but if you are prepared for avian influenza, you cannot expect relief supplies because it happens simultaneously around the world. We need to stockpile enough food to survive without going out for a few months until the epidemic subsides.
 -- Unlike an earthquake, water, gas, and electricity will not be cut off. Retort pouch food such as curry and rice is also acceptable as a stockpile.
 --- (Of course, we can't say that it won't stop if it becomes a huge epidemic)
 - Commercial bleaches containing hypochlorous acid (e.g., Haiter, Bleach) are inexpensive and easily available for inactivating viruses. Use a 0.02% solution for doorknobs and other parts that come in contact with the virus, and use a 0.1% solution for dishes and other items that come into contact with the mouth.
 - Neuraminidase inhibitor
 -- <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8E%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%9F%E3% 83%8B%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BC%E9%98%BB%E5%AE%B3%. E8%96%AC">Neuraminidase inhibitor - Wikipedia</a>
 -- "There are no data showing efficacy after 48 hours of onset." It is important to take it as soon as the onset of illness occurs.
 - prevention
 -- Gargle with Isodine
 -- Wash hands thoroughly

 *1198938815* I would like to eat a dish called young chicken ehif (Kinki area).

 I have been informed that a dish called "young chicken ehif" is very tasty, but I have no idea where to go to get it.

 I usually wipe my head from front to back while I go to the super public bath, but I tried wiping it the other way around.
 Hmmm, I feel like I have an even more childish face than usual!

 I just found out what a thing it was.
 If there is a second meeting, please invite me!

 Heh.
 It's gradually becoming less and less like the Python I liked.
