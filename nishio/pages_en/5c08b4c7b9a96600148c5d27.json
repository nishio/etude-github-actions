>The reason why my depressive symptoms became severe was that I set [goals] that involved [other people's] feelings in my creations, such as "I want to please others," and I had no way to observe other people's feelings, so I could not know whether I had achieved my goals or not, which made my creations less worthwhile. It is OK to have other people's feelings involved in the goal, but it is better that the goal can be completed only by oneself.
	[unclear accomplishment] because there is no [means of observation]: [unclear task].
