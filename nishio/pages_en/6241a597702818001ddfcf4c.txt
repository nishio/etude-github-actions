Three Steps on the Road to Wisdom
from [/arpla/three lines on the road to wisdom].
>"Three Changes" at the beginning of the first part of "[Zarathustra]"
> There are three developments of the spirit: the camel, the lion, and the child.
	[camel]
		> Live with patience, bearing a full burden, and with awe, under the ideal of "[Thou shalt]", believing in the values handed down from generation to generation.
	[Lion]
		>He says no to the old values and duties, and in his exasperated desire to "[I want]," he deprives himself of the freedom to create new values. But the lion has yet to create new value itself.
	[Pediatric]
		>We must begin the play of creation in innocence and oblivion, and finish the acquisition of our world in a position of "I am," so to speak, willful, saying the holy affirmation of our will.
	>Nietzsche also says something to the same effect in his last book, "The Path to Wisdom" ("The Innocence of Generation").
		> (cf. Encyclopedia of Nietzsche, pp. 129-30)
