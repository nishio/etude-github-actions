A game to get under the skin of probabilistic events
I thought it would be good to have [games] to observe [probabilistic] events in order to understand [statistics] science firsthand.

After all, not being able to feel [probability distributions] with a physical sense from one's own experience is the situation of those who find it difficult to learn statistics.

	Even if you draw a gacha with a probability of 1/100 a hundred times, you won't be surprised to find it won't hit you.
