Butterfly Dreams
>The dream of Zhuang Zhou was a butterfly. Butterflies are like this.
> I am not aware of the "right mindset". I don't know Zhou. I suddenly realize that it's not a matter of knowing.
> I don't know, Zhou's dream is for Butterfly and Butterfly's dream is for Zhou.
> The Chou and Butterfly are necessarily separate. This is what is called mononization.

	When [Yoichi Ochiai] says [materialization], he means this.
