	>If I steer my life in a direction that makes it more interesting, my uninteresting chores are going to increase dramatically... I don't know what to do...
	>We have to find the fun in the chores?
	>If the task is clear, you can just assign it to someone, but if the task is not clear and there are too many "projects that need task clarification", I don't know what to do.
	>Kaoru Nakajima: Keep a record of what chores have been done and make it a labor-saving task?
