DP I
[I - Coins https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_i]
	Given a number of coins and the probability of each of them being heads, the problem of finding the probability that the number of heads is greater than the number of tails.
	The number of coins that are face up when looking at the coins from the top is the domain of definition, and the value is the probability of the coin being face up.
