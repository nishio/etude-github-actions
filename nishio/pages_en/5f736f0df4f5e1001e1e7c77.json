Not defensive in online discussions
There are things in this world that can trick you into wasting your time. A familiar example for many is online discussions. When someone contradicts you, you feel attacked. Sometimes it is an open attack. When you are attacked, your instinct is to defend yourself. But, like many other instincts, "instincts" are not designed for the modern age. In many cases, contrary to your instincts, it is better not to defend against online attacks in this day and age. Defending will cost the attacker hours of your life.

Note: If you try to further defend yourself by viewing online dissent as an attack, you will be expressing your disagreement with the other person's opinion. This is seen by the other person as an attack as well. Unlike physical attacks, online attacks do not result in injury or escape, so the form of mutual aggression continues endlessly and sucks up time.

>But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. Things that lure you into wasting your time on them have to be really good at tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online. When someone contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life.
