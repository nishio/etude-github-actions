経営の極意
	The secret of management is to understand and meet the needs of customers.
	It's nothing new, but [the norm].
 But there are many people who talk about new "tricks" because there are customers in the world who want to be taught new "tricks.

	It's like dieting.
		Serious exercise or reducing excess calories is "the norm."
  People who don't want to do it seek "new ways," and "new ways" are invented and offered in response.

 If you want to learn efficiently, you should first ignore all such "stupid customer media" information.
