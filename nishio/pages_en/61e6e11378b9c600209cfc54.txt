I want to embed other pages
from [/villagepump/I want to embed other pages].
　I feel that "people who want to use it can put in user scripts" does not understand the need to "show others what you have deployed"[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　As for "how to show," I guess I'll have to make a prototype like [Scrapbox Reader] or something to get the message across.
　　From the beginning, we did not think about satisfying "needs to be shown to others" in Scrapbox[/villagepump/takker.icon].
　　 [I don't care about "how to show it to others" because I see it as a "tool for thinking" for myself.
　　 [/villagepump/nishio.icon] Even as a "[tool for thinking]," there are short-term and long-term elaboration, and the long-term one requires "writing so that others can see and understand" because the memory will not be retained "the next time I look at this".
　　  We had this conversation the other day.
　　  　I don't understand it when I look at the spatial arrangement of [/nishio/ stickies].
　　  　Intellectual production takes place in the process of conversion to [a format that others can see and understand].
　　  　[Format change]
　　  Putting it all together in a presentation format is a typical example of that "format that others can see".
　　 　And if it's the whole presentation, it's hard to reuse, and if it's cut out, it's hard to present, so it needs to be embedded.
　　 　If [my future self is a stranger], can I make it with UserScript? [/villagepump/yosider.icon].
　　 　If the presentation is something that plays only in your hand and shows the screen, that's still possible, but you can't see the material even if you share it afterwards, so it's very subtle...[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　 　　I don't know if I can print it out in hand and give it to you as a PDF...
　　 　　I feel there is room for improvement, but I guess it can't be helped if you think of it as the same as handing over a PowerPoint document as a PDF, since there is no environment to reproduce the same look and feel at the user's fingertips.
　 If the emphasis is on showing others, we think it is more appropriate to take the approach of [using scrapbox as a database for static hosting] rather than extending Scrapbox's functionality.
　  One approach is [Scrapbox Reader] and [Caramelize
