Intention to insult
[https://gyazo.com/52437f1a2d2bd4548ce5d7bd678cdbb3]
　Mr. A thinks he is on top.
　Mr. B thinks Mr. A is below him.
　　Sometimes at this stage, we don't distinguish between the top and the bottom.
　Mr. B speaks his mind openly and frankly.
　Mr. A feels "lowered".
　　Here, Mr. A may claim that Mr. B had an insulting intention to put Mr. A down.
　　There is no "[intent] to [lower]" or "[intent] to [insult]" because Mr. B thinks Mr. A is below him from the start.
　　　So I answer, "There was no intent."
　　Whether there was or was not an intent is not verifiable.
　　　So there's no room for argument here.

Based on this exchange, Mr. B can update "I'll try not to say those things to Mr. A".
　In that case, Mr. B's perception update would be "Mr. A is a person with a self-perception that is not true."
　This new perception itself is also insulting from Mr. A's point of view.
