Wiki mode
A typology of how each page of [Wiki] is used. (The world's first Wiki was developed by [Cunningham https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82% AC%E3%83%A0]'s C2 Wiki summarizes it.)

 Transition from a state in which each individual writes an opinion under his/her name ([thread mode]) to a state in which objective facts are written for a third party under no name ([document mode]), via a hybrid mode in which the upper half is document mode and the lower half is thread mode in the process, and so on. Best practices for collaborative editing by many people are summarized.

 In the early days, Wikipedia operated by manually creating [talk pages] for controversial content and using them in thread mode, while keeping the prominent parts in document mode. Later, the system began to create talk pages, and this is the way it is now.

 Many may find it surprising that the thread mode clearly states that "you may edit [others'] statements in the past".
