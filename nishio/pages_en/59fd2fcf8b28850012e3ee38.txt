The Parable of the Map and the Tower
	Lost without [a map].
 The perspective of walking down the street is a very low perspective
 Map is a very high viewpoint
 It's a high perspective, so you can't see what you can see from the perspective of walking down the street.
  You can't even notice a flower blooming on the side of the road, or that the road is impassable due to an accident, etc.
 On the other hand, the perspective of walking down the street is too much information? It's confusing, it's wrong.
 Maps are useful
 But maps are only for places well known to mankind, and when you are about to explore a new place, you will not be given a map of that new place.
 You need to climb as high as possible, such as a tower, to broaden your vision and make your own map.

	If you have a map, it would be beneficial to use it.
 If you don't have a map, you need to make one.
	If there is a tower to map, it is beneficial to go up to it
 If you don't have a tower, you need to build one.
