 Continued from yesterday. I drew around where the conditional and marginal distributions are both Gaussian.

 What I found out when I painted it.
 - 1: The operation to find the inverse matrix is only used in the definition of the precision matrix. So we can represent the covariance matrix and the precision matrix in separate squares.
 - 2: It's obvious that the vectors on the left side of the matrix are transposed, so we don't need to write them every time. Now it is in the form that there is always a light blue circle on the left side of the square. But there is one case where a matrix comes instead of a vector. How to express it?
 - 3: There is no such thing as xa coming next to Λbb. So if you know it's bb in the matrix part, you can omit the b in xb. (x - μ) is frequently used, so let's make it a circle or something.
 - 4: Λab and others are not square matrices to begin with, and their properties are fundamentally different from Λaa and others. It is not appropriate to make this a similar looking symbol. It does not have to be square in the first place.
 - 5: PRML is deformed by calling it the "exponential part of the Gaussian distribution", which is also a set of -1/2, but it makes no sense. The equation is cleaner to treat it with Mahalanobis distance since it explains that it depends on x only through Mahalanobis distance in front of it.
 - 6: PRML introduced the mysterious m in 2.85, but three of its five occurrences have Λbb^-1 from the right. The programmer's aesthetics whispered to me, "This renormalization is not good," so I put it in the m...ah, it's µb|a! If there is any disadvantage of this method, it is that the product of the matrices is placed in m, so we have to rearrange the order of the matrices in the last term m^T... but it's not that difficult. I think it's much better than making the reader worry by making a meaningless lumping.
 
 
 ↓There is no information content in the fact that the left side of this is light blue (because it is always light blue) & there is no information content in the a or b written inside the circle (because it is the same as inside the square).

 I think this is a good way to express the adjacency of matrices and which ones are square matrices. The problem is that it cannot be expressed by inverting the inverse matrix.
