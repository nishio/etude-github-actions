In this section, we learn about the process of model creation by discovering pattern and abstraction from the information gathered.

The content of this section is valuable that will not obsolete even after 10 years 20 years. However, this section is the most abstract part of this book. If you feel difficult to understand, you can skip over and read other chapters first. After you gather concrete materials to build understanding, you can more easy to understand. Especially the [KJ method] in Chapter 5 has a strong relationship as it is a concrete method to perform abstraction outside the brain.

The concept of abstraction is a powerful tool. However, the concept is abstract. How to learn it?

What should we do when learning abstract concepts? We learned it at the beginning of this chapter. You can not put the box in the air. Without collecting information as the foundation, you can not learn abstract concepts. Abstract concepts can not be understood even if they are explained in another abstract language. Everyone needs to build up boxes themselves. First of all, let 's collect concrete information about what abstraction is, and compare it.

In the book so far, to make the word "abstract" even more specific, we have described it together with "[modeling]" (making a model) and "[pattern discovery]." I will dig into each of these.
