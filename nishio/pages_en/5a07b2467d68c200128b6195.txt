Occupational Diseases of Programmers
Since [flesh-and-blood humans] move more ambiguously than machines, it is unnecessarily burdensome to treat them in the same way as we treat machines. We should treat ambiguously moving things without putting much effort into it.

>I think I understand why I am not very good at documents, because I was wondering whether the date should be the day I wrote the document, the day I submitted it, or the day I was told to submit it on. In programming, it is rare for something to "work even though it is slightly different," and even if it does work, there is a notion that writing code that "just happens to work" is a bad thing. So, even in writing documentation, we often think, "What's the right way to write it?" In reality, however, it is an operation that says, "As long as it is approximately correct, it is OK," so no matter where you look, you will not find the correct way to write it, or you will find multiple ways to write it and be confused as to which way is correct.
