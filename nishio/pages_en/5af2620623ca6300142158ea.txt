Generate flow
 On the metaphor of "creating [flow]"
 A lot of people seem to think of something that is already flowing and think of it as a strong flow that is aligned in one direction.
 however
 	Basic premise: It's stopped at this point.
  When something that is stopped begins to flow, it cannot begin as a "strong flow aligned in one direction".
  All the water suddenly moves in one direction at once."
   In an organization, everyone moves in one direction at once.
  That's impossible.
 First, stir in the proper direction.
 	Create a state of "not standing still."
  This "creates flow."
 It grows into a "big flow" after the fact.

Another Metaphor
	A small hole in the [dike].
 Nearby water begins to trickle down.
 That flow causes the hole to gradually enlarge.
 Water flow becomes progressively stronger.
 [positive feedback] occurs and the levee breaks.
 Water flows out all at once.
