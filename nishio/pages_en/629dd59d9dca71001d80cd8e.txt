  >[false dichotomy], the realization that you were talking about [/villagepump/deconstruction][/villagepump/blu3mo.icon].
　　I myself don't recognize it with the label "[deconstruction]" (although there seems to be some commonality).
　　I think you recognize that "false dichotomies often appear in the various thoughts of various people" rather than "false dichotomies exist in existing philosophical theories."
　　　Of course, philosophical theories of past philosophers are instances of "various thoughts of various people," so there is no contradiction.
　　I see, it's just part of the process of "deconstruction"...? [/villagepump/blu3mo.icon].
　　Deconstruction of Derrida in the narrow and original sense of the word "deconstruction:"
　　　>It refers to the simultaneous reading of a text by the same author with a tendency to establish some kind of absolute truth and, conversely, with a tendency to deconstruct the absolute truth. It is also called [deconstructive reading].
   If you use it in the sense of "I don't know what I'm doing," then it has nothing to do with what I'm doing.
  If we use the word "deconstruction" in the sense used by various people after Derrida, I can't say yes or no because at this point I don't feel the word is clearly defined (I'm getting a hint of a buzzword that tries to solve everything with the blockchain).
  　I think we have some common atmosphere.
