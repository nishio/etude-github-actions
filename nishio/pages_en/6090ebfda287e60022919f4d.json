 *1236328067*Set in the lower north
 I was told to meet at a station in Shimokita, so I searched for it in the transfer guide.

 This is indeed different. Hakodate.

 If you put an image like this on the site without explanation, I would be tempted to click on it. The site owner is in trouble because if he clicks on it, it is a violation of the terms of the agreement. After searching, I found out that this is a machine to make screws.
 
 *1236344077*Housework (shopping)
 The house is now much tidier, and the rice cooker is out and ready to cook rice, so I went out to buy some.
 - vegetable
 -- Spinach 7 148
 -- Nilla 89
 -- Maitake 128
 -- 1/4 Chinese cabbage 158
 -- Kimchi 288
 -- Tofu 68
 
 - 6 eggs 348
 - dairy products
 -- Milk 168
 -- Yogurt 4*3 148*3
 
 - fish
 -- Frozen Seafood 880
 -- Salmon flake 398
 -- Dried Hokke 398
 
 
 I thought it would not be very tasty since I put everything left in the freezer at random, but thanks to the frozen seafood, it was very tasty, so I replenished the supply of fish. I also found out that four pieces of dried hokke were only about 400 yen. I thought it was surprisingly cheap, so I bought some. I often make a one-pot dish with only vegetables and tofu because meat is too expensive and troublesome, but dried fish is not so troublesome, I thought.
 
 *1236346550*Housekeeping (electricity)
 For February: 7525 yen
 
 
 .... High, right? Maybe it's the heating....
 
 *1236356005* shipping from amazon.co.uk
 I put this together in Japanese for Ichnozama's <a href='http://ikunozama.appspot.com/special/amazon.co.uk/kaimono/'>summary of how to shop at amazon.co.uk</a>.
 
 <hr>
 
 Shipping costs from amazon.co.uk to Japan are shown below.
 
 -1.49 pounds (approx. 210 yen) per CD/DVD
 -Books 2.99 pounds per book (about 420 yen)
 
 In addition to this, the entire packaging as a whole will cost the higher of the following: 293 yen if you buy only DVDs or CDs, or 698 yen if you also buy books.
 
 -CDs and DVDs 2.09 pounds (about 293 yen)
 -2.99 pounds (about 698 yen) per bottle
 
 So, if you buy 3 DVDs, you pay 210 * 3 + 293 = 923 yen; if you buy 1 DVD and 1 book, you pay 210 + 420 + 698 = 1328 yen.
 
 
 Shipping charges for used items on the Marketplace are separate from this and are as follows.
 
 -3.58 pounds (approx. 504 yen) per CD/DVD
 -Books 7.00 pounds per book (about 980 yen)

 <body>I remember when I was at a robot contest in the past, I was quite excited when I saw one of my teammates touching it. This structure or appearance tickles boys' hearts, doesn't it?
