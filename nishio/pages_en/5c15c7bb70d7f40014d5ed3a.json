Respondent not answering the question
This is an example of a question-and-answer website where person A asked a question and person B answered it, but it appears to be unkind.
Complaints on the part of the questioner:
	I just wish they would clearly tell us the procedure.
	They say, "Can't you read the English error messages on the display?"
	They say things like, "Read the reference book."
	They will try to give away [extra knowledge] that is not what you asked about.

	The questioner only sees the issue at hand and seeks a solution to it.
		Thinking that given a solution to the task at hand, they will reach their ideal state.
	The respondent believes that the questioner's idea is a misconception.
		I believe that solving only the issue that the questioner is now asking about will not satisfy his/her needs.
		Consider that there are dozens of issues lined up after the one in front of you.
 	So we think we need to teach "[how to] get solutions" to the challenges we expect to encounter in the future.
 		Not the solution to the issue that is now being asked.
 		For example, for someone who sees an error message in English and says, "I got some kind of error.
	 		They are instructed to "be able to understand error messages."
		That's the point of view of the questioner and those who don't see "issues lining up".
			Seems "unkind, not answering what I asked."
	Respondents often forget to share with the questioner the information that the respondent thinks the "questioner is 'misled'".
