 Thoughts.
 　The question of whether there exists a shortest path from s to t that is exactly half the distance at a vertex along the way
 　Shortest paths exist in exponential order and cannot be enumerated and then examined.
 　Let's first find the distance between s,t and then find out if there's a vertex half that distance.
 　When the Dijkstra method is used to find the distance of s,t, the distance to the shorter vertex is already identified
 　　Choose exactly half the distance from there.
 　　　This is the worst case, there are almost N of them.
 　　The distance between t and s is obtained in the same way, or
 　　We can check if there exists a v such that d(s,v)=d(t,v)=d(s,t)/2
 　　　This is a linear order
 　　The amount of calculation is that of [Dijkstra method], so you can make it in time.
