 *1307638587* Psychology of the Unmotivated Leverage Memo
 >>
 This book is not a commentary on the causes of human despair, apathy, and oopsiness. It is a book about how people with a tendency toward lethargy can break free from it and live well. I am among those who have a tendency to become apathetic.
 <<
 
 This article is based on my reading of the author's "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4569704646/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yarukidenai-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=4569704646">The Psychology of the Unmotivated</a>".
 
 PS: Based on this entry, I created an <a href='http://www.nhiro.org/yaruki/#'>artificial intelligence</a> that gives advice tailored to your situation by answering an average of 10 questions. Recommendation.

 A good book (translation) written by Seligman himself is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4757210442/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yarukidenai-22&linkCode=as2 &camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4757210442">Only One Happiness in the World: Positive Psychology Teaches Us to Live a Fulfilling Life</a> or something like that.

 Last time I read <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20101014/1287070286'>40 Tips on How to Shush Anxiety</a> (Leverage Memo) by the same author (Giving up Kato) and it was surprisingly good, so I bought another book. <a href='http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4569704646/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yarukidenai-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative= 7399&creativeASIN=4569704646">The Psychology of the Unmotivated</a>
 
 This book explains the causes of human apathy, quoting from Seligman's paper. The book does not clearly describe Seligman's original experiment (well, I guess it is a judgment that ordinary readers will put the book back on the shelf if the setting of the experiment is suddenly mentioned at the beginning of the book), so if you want to know more details, please refer to "<a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5% AD%A6%E7%BF%92%E6%80%A7%E7%84%A1%E5%8A%9B%E6%84%9F'>learned helplessness</a>. Roughly speaking, "creatures that have experienced pain from which they cannot escape will not run away from pain from which they can escape.
 
 I thought it was dangerous that a person who is really tired of his/her mind might read this book and think, "Oh, that's why I'm so bad, I'm so useless, I'm so tainted by helplessness, I can't motivate myself forever, I'm sorry for living" because the original experiment is an experiment. I can't motivate myself for the rest of my life. I'm sorry I'm alive. The important thing is to be aware that both dogs and humans have a tendency to fall into such a trap, and when you feel unmotivated, look at yourself objectively and say, "Oh, now I am stuck in a feeling of helplessness," relax your shoulders and try again, thinking, "It may not work, but it might work. You did it! I'm glad I did it! When you succeed, you praise yourself, saying, "I did it!
 
 The following are excerpts from the text. The book is full of real-life examples and metaphors, but I'll spare you those. Also, the words "depression" and "neurosis" are sometimes mismatched with modern definitions, so I think it is better to interpret them as "a person who is mentally tired".
 
 >>
 A tired mind decides that what may or may not be possible is a definite no-no.
 <<
 
 >>
 Strangely enough, only those who don't do what they can, stick with it forever.
 <<
 
 >>
 People who do what they can are independent. People who do nothing when they know they can't do something have a strong request mindset.
 <<
 
 I'm hoping that someone will eventually figure it out - or maybe I'll get lucky and something will happen to resolve it.
 
 >>
 The person who says, "Of course not," pretends to be someone who knows what is going on. However, that phrase only expresses the person's powerlessness. To rationalize his or her powerlessness, he or she pretends to know more about the world than others. However, it is as if he is passive and request-driven, and as a result, professes that he is powerless.
 <<
 
 >>
 People who don't act begin to emphasize the pointlessness of taking action... "Of course not" is a good excuse for not taking action.
 <<
 
 >>
 Puts himself in a situation that makes him feel insecure about the future. They lament that they are dissatisfied and unhappy without taking any action to improve their lives. They had their chance. But they did not act. It is an inner problem and apathy that prevents them from taking advantage of opportunities. The difference between an apathetic person and a person who acts is the difference between giving up on possibilities and not giving up.
 <<
 
 >>
 A can-do person can act and give up when it doesn't work or when the possibility is gone. Apathetic people do nothing, say "It's bound to fail," and are forever unable to accept the results.
 <<
 
 >>
 hopelessness: mice given inescapable shocks became lethargic and did not escape when given escapeable shocks.
 <<
 
 >>
 Those who have given up cannot understand that an opportunity has arrived. Even if the opportunity is there, they cannot see it. Professor Langer has proposed the concept of mindfulness. We are doing too many things without thinking of what we can do. We give up on the things we can't do simply because we haven't thought of the means to do them.
 <<
 
 The venture managers I am familiar with are able to solve problems in unexpected ways and propose solutions that I would never have thought of.
 
 >>
 According to Seligman, when children use their own brain power to solve their frustrations, they learn to trust their own brain power. It gives him or her the confidence that he or she can do it.
 <<
 
 It may not be limited to children.
 
 >>
 They say, "I paid a high tuition." This is when people feel like they have been cheated and have lost money. Some people do not fight to recover their losses. They assume that they will lose even if they fight even before they fight. They waste their precious lives in regrets, lamenting their losses. The "I paid a high tuition fee" is merely an attempt by those who cannot overcome their failures to make their failures worthwhile by interpreting them.
 <<
 
 >>
 Unlike when you were a student, once you enter the workforce, you will be pressed for time, and situations will arise in which you will have to act without being fully prepared. It is impossible to do a proper job if you are psychologically confused at such a time.
 <<
 
 Earache.
 
 >>
 Elite salarymen are often described as "hiyouwa. They lose their motivation at the slightest failure. They feel depressed and say, "I'm done," even though the failure is something they can fully recover from. They lose motivation at the slightest handicap. They lack the spirit to overcome their handicaps.
 <<
 
 >>
 Sour grapes. Sweet lemons. It is painful to admit failure as failure, and when a person tries to belittle the successes of others, a feeling of helplessness arises deep within that person that his or her life is no longer in control
 <<
 
 >>
 Where do feelings of self-respect come from? According to Seligman, it comes not from what you have, but from the experience that your actions change the world. Even if you have money, it is not enough to have feelings of self-esteem. On the contrary, that is why people buy luxurious cars and go to expensive restaurants in order to turn away from the feeling of self-worthlessness. We can see their frustration in their attitude of flaunting luxury.
 <<
 
 >>
 According to Seligman, good things that happen independently of one's reactions create a sense of helplessness. It does not promise happiness in life. Sometimes, therefore, we lose confidence.
 <<
 
 >>
 If someone has never made a wrong decision in his life, he has simply never made one himself.
 <<
 
 >>
 Children with high self-esteem have clear standards of judgment. Some people in the world use vague criteria to measure themselves and others, such as "he is small in scale. Such people have low self-esteem.
 <<
 
 The English text is lined up and it says self-esteem. I think it is better to translate it as "self-efficacy," but I guess it is just a word that readers don't know, so it is simplified. (PS: Self-efficacy is self-efficacy, so self-esteem seems to be the more appropriate translation here.)
 
 >>
 A story about a couple who lived in a big house and kept complaining. Why didn't they sell their house and move to a smaller house? Because they were afraid of change. The story of a businessman who bought a house and became neurotic, caught between paying off the loan and the fear of being fired. Why? Because he worried unnecessarily. He worried, but he did not prepare for the possibility of being fired. Don't worry.
 <<
 
 >>
 The norm of "should" and the desire to appear larger than one actually is make the situation unmanageable. The person who is obsessed with the idealistic ego of being active in a foreign country becomes neurotic because he is crushed by the demands of others, which he cannot meet. People who live happily with their challenges are not so afraid of failing in their challenges. They are not afraid that failure will hurt their ideal ego. They are not afraid of being disappointed for not doing what they were asked to do. People who have a hard time living with challenges and stress are dying to be disappointed by others.
 <<
 
 >>
 Basqualilla: "When one's mind is sick, one's choices become limited," and since one sticks to one way, the situation becomes unmanageable and stressful, making one's mind even sicker.
 <<
 
 >>
 When parents demand a lot, children always feel like they are being demanded by others, even when they grow up. So meeting people becomes a daunting task.
 <<
 
 >>
 People with a sense of inferiority make assumptions about themselves and about others. They assume that people do not like them because they are flawed. They assume that people are insecure without checking carefully.
 <<
 
 >>
 A sense of hopelessness destroys the person's other abilities. A kindergartner is given a solvable task and rewarded for correct answers, or rewarded irrespective of response. The latter then learns the slowest when given a solvable task. slower than the group that did nothing. When kindergartners were given solvable and nonsolvable problems by different teachers and then given a solvable problem by the teacher who gave the nonsolvable problem they could not solve the problem.
 <<
 
 >>
 They assume that as they get older, their abilities diminish. This sense of helplessness causes them to lose their abilities.
 <<
 
 >>
 According to Karen Hornay, self-deprecating people compulsively seek honor.
 <<
 
 Because they lack self-confidence, they want someone to tell them they are "great. And then, when they act like they're great, they are looked down upon. Even if someone says "great" to you and your self-esteem rises, someone else will poke a hole in it and crush the balloon that is about to inflate.
 
 >>
 How can you be confident if you don't like yourself? A man who is confident as a man does not feel a sense of urgency that he must be liked by this woman. A man without self-confidence will feel anxious that he must be liked. If he is not liked, he exacerbates his self-doubt. He will resort to anxious tension, bluffing, and flaunting of his manhood. As a result, they are not able to show their good side in front of the grantor. People are disliked by the act of trying to be liked. They try to be respected, so they brag and are disliked. If you are natural, people will like you even if you have faults.
 <<
 
 >>
 Inferiority. Because of fear of others, what they have looks wonderful and what they have looks boring.
 <<
 
 >>
 mindlessness, a narrowing of one's way of life and one's possibilities by making assumptions about one's own potential.
 <<
 
 >>
 People who judge themselves tend to judge others as well. There are people who make themselves conform to such judgments: "You are happy," "You are kind," "You have not had a hard time. Some people are troubled because they cannot say, "I am not like that. Their goal in life is to meet the expectations of others. Those who do not feel annoyed by having their ideal image imposed on them are those who have low self-esteem.
 <<
 
 >>
 According to Karen Hornay, there are three types of anxiety coping. One of them is pandering. This is the self-annihilation type. This type of coping results in hopelessness. A panderer can only pander. They cannot be aggressive. They cannot withdraw.
 <<
 
 >>
 There are those who hurry not because they have a reason to hurry, but because they are driven by anxiety and fear that consumes them in their daily lives. There are those who do nothing but are exhausted. Not knowing what they are rushing toward is not what they are rushing toward. They are just trying to escape from the status quo.
 <<
 
 >>
 People's dissatisfaction is proportional to their degree of passivity. When we do various projects, participants are usually highly dissatisfied in order of passivity.
 <<
 
 There is.
 
 >>
 Students exposed to inescapable noise, students exposed to no noise, and students exposed to inescapable noise, hopelessness also delays the resolution of non-hateful tasks. An inescapable aversive experience makes the student less active in non aversive daily tasks.
 <<
 
 This is frightening. For example, when there are people in the home who do nasty things that are impossible to escape, it's easy to assume that even if you're studying in school, you're not good enough if you fail a little bit. I guess helplessness is a disease that can eat away at your whole life.
 
 >>
 Giving up reinforces a sense of helplessness.
 <<
 
 >>
 People who don't act like to speculate and argue more than those who do. They argue to a surprising degree. They guess what the other person is trying to do. Because they only guess without taking confirmatory action, they guess too much and start thinking behind the scenes. They complicate simple things by guessing.
 <<
 
 >>
 Unlike rats, if humans remain frustrated, the misfortune of others who seem to be living a joyful life becomes their joy in life. Envy others, and the misery of others becomes your joy.
 <<
 
 There are some. For example, there are many on 2chan.
 
 >>
 When you find yourself frustrated, don't forget to make an effort to break free. Do not assume that you cannot change. Sometimes you can try and you can't, but sometimes you can.
 <<
 
 >>
 They say they are dissatisfied with the teachers, they are dissatisfied with the school. When asked what they are dissatisfied with, they cannot answer. People who express such dissatisfaction do not take any action to solve the problem.
 <<
 
 So the dissatisfaction remains ambiguous and continues unresolved for a long time.
 
 >>
 The dog, hit by an inescapable electric shock, quickly dismounts from the competition.
 <<
 
 >>
 Build your own foundation. Stop ignoring or overworking your body. You can't run fast, about where you are afraid. Accept it. Starting from "this is how it should be" is stressful. You think that when you achieve the "should," you will be liberated. But that "should" is an unrealistic standard.
 <<
 Even if you think you have set a realistic standard, once you reach that point, you see further and think, "I should be able to do that too. There will never come a time when you feel you have achieved it.
 
 >>
 We are worried about something closer to home, but we avoid confronting it and discussing the state under the sun. That is why we cannot overcome our sense of hopelessness no matter how long we wait. It is hard to love one's neighbor, but it is easy to love mankind. I despair of mankind" is a reflection of "I am disappointed in me.
 <<
 
 >>
 You demand high standards from others because you have repressed disappointment in yourself. You are trying to resolve your own emotional conflicts by finding what you have repressed in others and blaming them for it.

 **Measurements
 One test, OK 1. That's as it should be! Now all the "word cards from 2 years ago" that were first unearthed are safely in the review list. I'm so happy.
 I tested only one card and was frustrated with the correct answer, so I tested the additional word cards I had in my stack. 14 of them OK, 13 NG, 1 NG. So far, it took less than 2 minutes.
 
 I also tested some words that came up when I was reading the paper last night. This was NG 4 out of 4. What a low percentage of correct answers! Was my brain too tired at night to remember?
 
 Then today is your first review day...41 review tests took 5.5 minutes, ok 41. Excellent. But there is one card that I suspect is incorrect, the one about the difference between could and was able to, where it says that could is "had the ability to solve it if I wanted to (ability)" and was able to is "actually solved it in the past (did)", but the OALD explanation is could" is used for "generically able to do in the past" such as "I was able to walk when I was 3 years old", and "was able to" or "manage" should be used to refer to what was possible in a specific situation in the past. could not be used. You can use could not in the negative, and you can use could when accompanied by a perceptive verb such as see; you should not put could in I [ ] find some useful books in the library. The explanation is "I [ ] find some useful books in the library. Well, I guess you could say that was able to is a "specific situation" because it was actually performed. In other words, it doesn't feel right to explain "could" as "had the ability (capability) to solve it if I wanted to. Let's fix it.
 
 **Review and update goals
 - "I'll do it again tomorrow" 3 days in a row ◎
 - "Empty the study pile within a week" achieved! ◎
 - "We will do the first review phase tomorrow and measure the time and percentage of correct answers" - I did it. Perfect score ◎
 Goals for tomorrow
 - I was thinking of taking the day off, but they said it gets harder when there are two days between, so I'll do Saturday and Sunday.
 - Read through the English paper, even if it is one pomodoro at a time on Saturdays and Sundays, and pick up words you don't understand.
