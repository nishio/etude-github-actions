"Putting it all together" and "getting it together."
Jiro Kawakita sometimes describes "[put together]" and "[put together]" as different things.
　It is not a matter of humans trying to put it all together, but of the data coming together on its own.
　When people who have heard this and have experience with "[coming together] on its own" will say, "Oh, that.
　If you have no experience, you may be thinking, "It comes together on its own? How is that possible?" p.53
　It is similar to explaining a bicycle in words to someone who has never ridden one before, but they don't get it [the bicycle metaphor].

In Ideas, p. 53, he writes
	>While I was obsessed with the vague and big-broth term "compiling materials," my research materials "never came together," which is a very ironic result.
　The rest of the section is abstract and difficult to communicate.
　>It "comes together" only when both methods of summary analysis and integration are exercised in their entirety in a relevant manner.
	He uses the strong phrase "ambiguous and big talk."
	　In short, I'm pointing out that everyone thinks they know what "putting it all together" means, and that I think I can do it, but I'm not sure what exactly "putting it all together" means.
[Let the chaos speak for itself], p. 331, counterposes the KJ method with "[normal summary thinking]."

　p.332〜334:
　　Mosaic World
　　An ecological world of seamless meaning
 This is an interesting story, but I'll explain it another time.
 roughly speaking
 　[Summary thinking] is beneficial because it reduces decision time, but we tend to use it even in situations where it is not available
 　Then the "well put together" becomes a pieced together "[mosaic world].
 　Exploration nets are "[seamless]" joined together.
