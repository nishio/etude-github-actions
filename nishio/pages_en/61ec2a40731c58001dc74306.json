  >"Appetite is not evil," just as desire for approval is not evil.

　Why is it that shokai who hate [the system that stimulates approval] do egos when egos have an invitation to the dark side of approval?
　　[the resolution of the word "egoism" needs to be increased].
　　It is a speculation of [/villagepump/nishio.icon], but searching Twitter by the name of the product you are involved in is beneficial to observe "user reaction to the product" without distorting it.
　　　[user's honest reaction].
　　　When posting on official forums, users tend to feel that they are in the creator's home and that they are away from home, and so they unconsciously tend to write well behaved things.
　　Many people who quit because Scrapbox didn't fit their needs are posting something on Twitter[/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon].
　　　Thoughts after frequently seeing tweets containing "Scrapbox" using TweetDeck.
　　[/villagepump/shokai.icon]Mr. [/villagepump/shokai.icon]is delusional that he may have become sensitive to issues around approval because he has always been a twitter fan[/villagepump/yosider.icon].
　　 [/villagepump/shokai.icon]さんtwitter好きなんだ[/villagepump/takker.icon]
　When a reply is received and notified on Twitter, this notification comes irrespective of the recipient's work status.
　　When actively ego-searching, do so when you are finished with your work and gather information.
　　So, isn't egoism better than notification?
