World Density
Since I started making custom models in my micra, I've been walking down the street and seeing the lights and stuff.
　"Oh, I can make this one," "This one is difficult because it has a taper," "There is a series with a similar structure, I wonder if it is made by the same manufacturer."
　Antennas for cell phone base stations, water fountains in parks, and many other things that make you say, "Whoa, this is easy to make.

There's a sense that the world is getting denser.

I've had similar sensations in the past.
　I bought a 3D printer.
　I wanted to make a box with a movable part, a lid that opens and closes, so I did a lot of trial and error.
　Then I went to the 100 yen uniform and was impressed by how well the joints on the container were made.

[Literacy]
　The ability to read information from the world is not just something we are born with.
　　Some things only some people become capable of understanding later in life.
　　　Japan's literacy rate is almost 100%, so it is easy to forget that "being able to read" (literacy) is the most important factor.
