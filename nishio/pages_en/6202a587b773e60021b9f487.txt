Bitcoin as a Means of Attack
Plant [memes] of [bitcoin] in the target civilization as a means of attack [sci-fi setting].

>I wonder if computerized [post-human intelligence] has already come into being, and they're doing this to squash humanity?
	>[nishio.icon] The view that "posthuman intelligence is going to grind humanity down" is looking at things from the side of the old forces, and from the side of the new forces, "We are humanity, and let's not let the old homo sapiens get in the way of our newly budding civilization [resource consuming toys] and let them play with them, and we'll give them Bitcoin and [HFT] and what else do you want?" I'm sure he'll say something like that.

>I think the enemy is not humanity, but aliens.
> Are they aliens derived from silicon organisms? If so, they seem to move slowly.
	>[nishio.icon] If a "slow-moving body" organism derived from [silicon organisms] happens to get an electrical signal that moves around at a faster speed, if it develops a self-image that "the body is a tether, and the thoughts freed from it are the essence," it will interfere with other civilizations and Developing computers will be perceived by them as "increasing the land they can colonize," so of course they'll do it.
