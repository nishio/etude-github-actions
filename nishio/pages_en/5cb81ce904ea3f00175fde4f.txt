Self-attack trap
>What is more troublesome than making personal attacks on others is falling into the trap of blaming oneself. If you see yourself as the root cause of the problem, then the only way to solve the problem is to change yourself. This is the basis of the doctrine that many self-help books "propagate," but from a problem-solving perspective, it is a demagoguery that not only avoids practical problem-solving, but also induces futile efforts.
Problem Solving Compendium p. 312

What is the practical solution to the problem in this case?
Even if "[t]he only thing that can be changed is one's behavior," there are numerous options as to which behavior to change and how.
You must first understand the overall structure of the problem and figure out if there is a [root cause], if there is a [vicious cycle], and then think about how you can change your behavior to solve the problem, but you myopically attribute the cause to yourself.
