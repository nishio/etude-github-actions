Permanent link to sticky
	 When a sticky has a [permalink] and you jump from there to the map where the sticky is used,
	 I want that sticky to appear in the center.
 	Assumption: [I want to include the initial camera position in the URL].

	Q: Will each sticky have its own URL?
		A: In the future, it would be nice to have a permalink to the detailed information page of each sticky, from where you can see "[list of maps where the sticky is used]" or something like that.
