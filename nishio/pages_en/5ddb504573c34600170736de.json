Liquefaction not summary
[summary] not [liquefaction].

	I've been looking into [summary technology] for a while now, and I had the sense that what I was looking for wasn't here.
 Consider what it is.
 The original text is large, and the summary breaks it down into smaller pieces and then picks up some of the pieces.
 What are the criteria for picking up on this part of the pickup?
 This standard is within the individual.
 And yet, the automatic summary picks up on the "criteria shared by all".
 	So you only try to present to humans what you have after you pick it up.
	What is important is the process of clarifying the criteria within the individual.
 Letting the criteria output in the form of "keywords" and returning snippets and links that match them is [search].
 Reveal the "criteria" that the individual has not yet verbalized by choosing from the options, and make a presentation based on that.
 	This is behavioral [targeted] advertising, right?

		Use keywords and other information sources used in your search.
 We need a system that will once again chew up the long, crystallized text into reasonably sized fragments.
 	The story is that they thought they should do that first and then build the back-end process.
