 *1341654840*I created a website to learn LISP.
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20120501/1335846610'>What we want to make: a site to learn core concepts of programming languages</a>, <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/ nishiohirokazu/20120619/1340115934'>sequel to part 2</a>.
 
 We have created a site that allows you to run LISP code interactively on your browser.

 As it stands, there is still not enough explanation so that someone who does not yet know LISP at all will be able to understand it by looking at this site.
 
 TODO
 - Prepare sample code at a granularity that allows you to learn one step at a time.
 - Stick with the code for real-time visualization of the tree see <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20120707/1341657664'>I created a site to visualize the parse tree</a>.
 - Write commentary for code reading

 *1341657664* I created a site to visualize the parse tree.
 We have created a site to visualize JavaScript syntax trees in real time on your browser. You can easily experiment and observe the basic concept of syntax trees, a programming language, without installing anything in particular.

 TODO
 
 - I don't really like the way the tree layout is done. I've read the paper and implemented it in LazyK-on-browser, so I'll replace it soon.
 - Also display LISP and Python syntax trees.
