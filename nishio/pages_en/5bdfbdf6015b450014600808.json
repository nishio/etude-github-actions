coyote (carnivore, Canis latrans)
>The author played "Coyote". This is a game in which you try to figure out the sum of everyone's numbers in a situation where only the numbers on your cards are unknown to you, but you can see other people's numbers. The game is played by trying to figure out what your number is from other people's behavior, since others can see what you cannot. When you deny what the person immediately preceding you said, you say, "Coyote!" but judging from the information I can see, I assume "of course this is about the value" and confidently say "Coyote! but the person in front of me was not wrong because I had a rare card! But the person in front of me was not wrong because I had a rare card! Of course, everyone knew that I had a rare card except me. It was a game that taught me that there are things that I cannot see, so I can make mistakes if I judge only by the information I can see.
