問題発見
If you are satisfied with the status quo, you will not discover the problem.

If the problem is "[the gap between the ideal and the reality]," the ideal must be far from the reality to cause a problem.

When you think, "This tool is inconvenient," if you accept it as "that's the way it is," the problem you were about to discover will disappear.
