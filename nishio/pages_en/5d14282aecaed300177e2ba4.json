Why do image stickies move strangely?
　Performance issues?
　Is there a problem with the image sticky?
→On another map with no performance issues, only the image stickies move fast while other stickies can be dragged decently.
　I think it's because the image sticky has a quarter-sized Raster on the surface, and that's what's causing the problem.
→Conclusion: Chrome on PC has null width for images not yet loaded, whereas Chrome on iPad has 0.
