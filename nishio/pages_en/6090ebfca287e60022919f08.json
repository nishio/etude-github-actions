 *1230208937* Conversation with her
 >>
 Python: Hey, why did you pick me?
 Me: What?
 Py: Even though there are all kinds of other kids.
 Me: It's not that I chose you, it's just that I happened to meet you at my part-time job, and I've been going out with you because you can do a lot of things and are easy to handle.
 Py: Hmmm, I see...(sad eyes)
 Me: What's up with you all of a sudden?
 Py: Actually, you know, I saw your blog.
 Me: So?
 Py: I've read a lot about a kid named AS3.
 Me: Ah.
 Py: Why not me?
 Me: Eh, because you don't look good and you're not very diplomatic so it's hard to show off too much.
 Py: And you seem to be obsessed with this CUDA girl lately?
 Me: Yes, yes, yes. It's expensive and a lot of work, but when it works out, it's very special. It tickles a man's fancy. It's a man's dream to train a horse.
 Py: I could do it too, if I tried hard enough,
 Me: What? What are you talking about? Do you really think you can compete with C and CUDA?
 Py: Ugh, so you don't need me anymore?
 Me: That's not true honey. I've never given up your shell. You know, I used your shell when I calculated the C++ speedup rate.
 Py: ...

 I'm a terrible guy.
 
 Footnotes:.
 >>
 Many different children: many different languages
 You can do a lot of things: a large library
 Poor looking: poor graphics (compared to AS3)
 Not diplomatic: doesn't work in browser
 It costs money: you have to buy the equipment to use it.
 There are a lot of things to take care of: you need to be aware of the number of processors on the hardware, etc.
 If it works, it's also exceptional: many times faster than C (in some cases, more than 100 times faster!).
 In your place: Interpreter language origins
 I've never let go of your shell for a single moment: true story. Python is always running on my MacBook. I think it's mainly used as a calculator.
