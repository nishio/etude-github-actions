 *1242269602* Boys Ranch
 PS: I wrote two objectively identifiable problems in <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090514/1242284776'>Problems with Boys Ranch</a>.

 On May 13, 2009, we will launch "Boys' Farm," a men's information sharing site, as a mobile service for women who are active in marriage.
 <<
 
 A ranch!
 Livestock!
 
 >>
 Boys' Farm" is a community site for women where friends can share and introduce information about men to each other.
 
 Through the "Ranch" on the mobile site, members can register photos and brief profiles of the men they associate with (*2) and manage their information, allowing other members who have been approved as friends to view the registered men's data.
 <<
 
 Scary. I wonder if this is a place to register boys who seem to have no pulse and then GIVE & TAKE with other female friends.
 If it were a reverse version of "Girl's Farm," I am sure it would be crushed at the planning stage, and even if it were released, I am sure it would be bashed with great force. Why "boy ranch" would be allowed is a mystery to me.
 
 <hr>
 
 Naturally, I thought that the information I registered would be available only to my friends, but a woman I did not know registered a boy, and it was displayed as "New Arrival Ranch" with cancer. Don't boys have human rights? Oh, I see, they are livestock, so they don't have them. The ranches can be categorized along two axes: "Ikemen/Tsukemen", "Kin/Poor", and "Skinny/Petite"...a man (looks like he is in his 30s) whom I don't recognize is categorized as a "Petite & Petite". I'm scared. Carnivorous girls scare me.
 
 *1242282671*Re: The story of how my vision went from about 0.5 to 1.2.

 The trick seemed to be to keep one's eyes open and not to frown.
 <<
 
 Yes, indeed, I do the same thing, even though I have been programming for a long time since I was 10 years old and I have 1.5 in both eyes. Many people squint when they have difficulty seeing, but I stare into the distance with my eyes wide open "as if the aperture of a camera is widening" when I look into the distance.
 
 For example, when leaving after concentrated work at the office or elsewhere, if I think, "Oh, my eyes are tired and it's hard to see in the distance," I look into the distance. But I don't just look into the distance, I stare at my cell phone screen or my fingernails or something to "focus up close" and then focus into the distance. I don't think I've ever counted the tiles. I do alternate between looking near and far until the lights and antennas on tall buildings stop blurring.
 
 I don't claim that this will cure myopia, because I've never been nearsighted. But if you do this exercise of looking near and far, it takes less time to focus on the distance than it did before you started. It's like rotating your arms when your shoulders are stiff, and you can do it as a kind of stretching after overworking your eyes.
 
 <hr>
 
 Also, if the font size is 10pt in an editor or something, I'll be the first to change it to 14pt - 18pt. I don't even like to write Japanese sentences with 10pt font size, let alone programming. Maybe that's part of the reason my eyesight hasn't deteriorated.

 I don't need to say much; I'll just point out two things.
 
 - It says, "Members who are approved as friends can view the registered male data of other members." It is easy to misunderstand that "you can only browse among friends," because it says "you can only browse among friends," but just by creating an account and logging in, you can see the face images of unknown men registered by unknown women and information written by women.
 - It says, "Registration of a male profile requires the consent of the man himself," but as evidenced by the rabbits and stuffed animals already registered, there is no mechanism whatsoever to confirm "whether or not the man himself has given his consent."
 
 *1242288635*[Django]Create tags with different expressions for different flavors.
 <a href='http://djangoproject.jp/doc/ja/1.0/howto/custom-template- tags.html'>Make your own template tags and filters &#8212; Django v1.0 documentation</a>
 
 >>
 To make it easy to create this type of tag, Django provides a helper function called simple_tag.
 <<
 
 >|python|
 def current_time(format_string):
     return datetime.datetime.now().strftime(format_string)
 
 register.simple_tag(current_time)
 ||<
 
 What's this? It's very simple. What I wanted to do was to create a tag that would change the expression depending on the user's attributes, such as "median (or both in case of a tie)" for flavor=novice (novice mode), and only "median" for flavor=advanced. It is similar to the "trans" tag, which displays in English or Japanese depending on the language of the browser, but I wanted to separate it from the language setting. That's all there is to it.
 
 >|python|
 def mytrans(key, flavor):
     return data[flavor][key]
 
 register.simple_tag(mytrans)
 ||<
 
 Data is a dictionary of dictionaries, and you can import the definitions from some appropriate place.
 
 <hr>
 
 And so far it was easy enough, but in the Google App Engine + app-engine-patch environment, I put the template tag in the exact location as described, created a proper templatetags/__init__.py, and set the INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py, but it fails to load. APPS is also set, but it fails to load. I fixed it after some tinkering and restarting the server. Trying to make it fail again didn't work. Was restarting the server the right thing to do?
 
 *1242321477* "Girls Ranch" was released.
 <del>Girls Ranch</del><a href='http://nishiotools.appspot.com/matrixfarm/'>Matrix Ranch</a>(PS: We had a lot of problems with the naming so we changed it. I'm not really into girls!")
 
 After playing with <a href="http://otoboku.jp">Boys' Farm</a> for a while, I thought it would be interesting to co-edit the Matrix, so I created this site. However, I thought it would not be very appropriate to play with the personal information of real people, so I have prohibited the posting of personal information in the Terms of Use. When you log in at the top page, you can move items placed by people who have created a new matrix or added items, saying "Oh no, this one goes here.
 
 
 For me, the interesting point of "Boys' Farm" was that "you can put various things on the matrix that you set as the axis and show them to others. Well, it is an alpha release, and I will decide what to do in the future depending on the response.
 
 
 Yah, but I haven't written JS or CSS in a long time. I'm using jQuery UI to drag items. Behind the scenes is Google App Engine + Django + app_engine_patch.

 To be honest, I didn't really care about girls, I just wanted to do something like this. I'm a herbivorous guy, sasenwww, and the assembly language is obviously in the wrong place.

 <body>>I am sure that if it were a "girl ranch" it would be crushed in the planning stage, and even if it were released, it would be bashed with great force. <br>Why "boy ranch" would be allowed is a mystery. <br>I think it's because the difference is that the public still shares the perception of a male-dominated society. <BR>The idea is the same as the following. <BR><BR>The opinion that "men and women are equal, so it is wrong to be hard on men" is wrong. <BR>"Men and women are not equal (predominant to men). <BR>"Therefore, we should be strict with men to improve the position of women."<BR>I think this is the<BR>reason for the female superiority principle here in Komachi, where many women are considered to be women. <br>http://komachi.yomiuri.co.jp/t/2009/0429/237203.htm?g=04<br><br>Magical smackdown</body>
