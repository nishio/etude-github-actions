	I've written before that [type thinking that similar things existed in the past] is caused by equating them, ignoring the differences.
	Independently of this, I wrote that [cognitive resolution] varies from person to person, which is why we see different things in different ways.
	I just realized that this is strongly related.
	As I was about to write down this realization, yet another article flashed through my brain
	That's [the advice of the expert and the opinion of the layman].
	This is the story of "the advice of a professional is useful, but the advice of an amateur is not. On the other hand, an amateur's opinion is useful, but a professional's opinion is not.
	Mapping "expert/amateur" to "high/low cognitive resolution
		Suppose there is a person X who has a low cognitive resolution and seems to equate things that are different for him.
		It is not useful if Mr. X comes to me for advice on how to proceed with the project, etc.
			Because X is only vaguely more aware of the project than you are.
		On the other hand, Mr. X's impression discards the details, so it is useful to know how many people feel
			'I see, you can't tell the difference between this and that.'
			Do you see the situation then in the past as the same as it is now?"
			Useful for communicating something to a large number of people so they know where to emphasize the differences.


	[abstraction increases with age].
		Some people seem to lose resolution with age and some don't.
		There are three ways people think about the "lower resolution = higher abstraction" ability X
			1: Cannot acquire X
			2: Gain X to increase the level of abstraction.
				This has great merit.
				Meanwhile, the resolution goes down.
			3: Plus another skill Y can be acquired and raised or lowered.
				Is it like this? I still don't see clearly what this is.
