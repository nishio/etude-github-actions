Others are grouped together

　At birth, I think Tanin interprets this as pattern 1: "others are a group".
　　I'm assuming that what I tell A, B gets it too.
　　I'd rather think they know what I'm thinking without having to put it into words.
　Developmental process moves to Pattern 2 "others are individuals" interpretation with the observation that "they don't get the message".
　　But this interpretation goes too far.
　　　It's possible that A and B are exchanging information in ways that I can't see.
　For example, a man X motions to one of a group of women, Ms. A
　　Mr. A responds with "not bad, but we've only just gotten to know each other" +/- 100 points, about +10.
　　Here, Mr. X thinks, "I'll take a few hits" and makes a motion to Mr. B as well.
　　If this information is shared between A and B, A and B will both assess -100, and this information will be widely disseminated to women who have not yet been approached by X, who is connected to A and B, and they will all assess -100.
　　X, who is unaware of this principle, is trapped in the interpretation of "others are individuals" more than the actual reality.
　For example, scammer X brings a good story to Mr. A.
　　Mr. A was not deceived because he had heard the story of how Mr. B was almost deceived
　what does that mean?
　　Individuals that understand the defensive advantages of swarming actively exchange information to form virtual swarms
　　Predators are more efficient at attacking individuals that are isolated from the herd.
