[Vision] and [culture]
　The process of creating a "vision" is to take the unspoken, unarticulated "[sense of value]" within each individual, "verbalize" it, and then change it into "words" that can be shared.
　However, there are two patterns as to what happens after the "vision" is created
　Bad Pattern: Only the "words" of the vision stand alone
　The word would be "groundless."
　Words become "abstract concepts" that are detached from concrete experience and cannot be delved into.
　When the vision is actually used in the individual's daily actions and decisions, it is stored within the individual as an inner [experience] of the individual ([internalization]).
　　This forms a loosely shared value system among several people, in a word, "[culture]."
　　Not the verbalized vision itself, but the value of this shared value "culture".
　　If this good pattern is followed, the words of the vision will not be considered absolute, and the words of the vision will be revised as needed.
　　If this good pattern is created, "vision" in the form of "short sentences" is not always necessary
　　　In cases where, for example, the annual training slides for new employees are revised every year but convey basically the same values, these slides serve the same function as the vision
