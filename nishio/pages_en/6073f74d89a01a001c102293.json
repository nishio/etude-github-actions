Firestoreで一覧取得を禁止する
The security rules for [Firestore] initially look like this
code::
 match /{document=**} {
   allow read, write;
 }

This read permission can be divided into get and list. By restricting this list privilege, it is possible to prohibit the acquisition of a list.
code::
 match /{document=**} {
   allow get;
   allow list: if false;
   allow write;
 }

The following code was successful before narrowing down the security, but after narrowing it down, the error occurs as expected
code::
 firebase.firestore().collection("collection_foo").get().then((qs) => {
   qs.forEach((d) => console.log(d.id));
 });
 // Uncaught (in promise) FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
