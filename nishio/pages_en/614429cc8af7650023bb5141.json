Kozaneba開発日記2021-09-17
Not much of a development diary this week, because we're not using the user-friendly features.

What we did.
	Reduce oscillations in physics calculations
	Move unpin to the add user menu instead of the system menu
	　Physics itself is still an experimental feature that can be added and used by user scripts.
	Created an API for adding arrows and added the ability to pull arrows together in a user menu.
	Create server API to hit kintone API
		Delete this once
	Adjust position and color of link icons
	Created a demo that taps the kintone API to create kozane
	Added server API to create places
	Browser extension to create Kozaneba's Ba from kintone's record list

release notes
	Reduce oscillations in physics calculations
	Move unpin to the add user menu instead of the system menu
	　Physics itself is still an experimental feature, added and used by user scripts, so it is misleading that it is displayed even to those who have not added it.
	矢印追加APIを作成
		Added the ability to pull arrows together in a user script.

	Added server API to create places with JSON

	Add the double-headed arrows to the menu because they are used so often.
	　In addition, the arrow addition menu up to now also clearly states that right is head.
	Fixed an error when an element was removed from a group without a title with an arrow and the group was automatically deleted
