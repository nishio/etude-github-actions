　Thoughts.
　　Bipartite graph of 200 at the highest, 10^4 even if you use the edges naively, what's the difficulty?
　　Oh, is it generally difficult to solve maximum bipartite matching by attributing it to maximum flow?
　Official Explanation
　　The above solution is mentioned as an "afterthought."
　　The assumed solution is O(N) by finding a means to determine Greedy
