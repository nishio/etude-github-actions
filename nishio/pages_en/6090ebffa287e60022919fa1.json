 *1243588617*[Blender]Koch Curved Aurora Borealis
 If you create a Halo material, the Halo will appear at the vertex position. I arranged them in the shape of a Koch curve.

 When I looked at a photo of the aurora borealis, I thought it didn't look like an aurora borealis, but the actual aurora borealis has no upper boundary.

 I made the color green and darkened the background. The Halo material itself does not seem to have a gradient function.

 An added bonus: Halo materials are like this. They put 100 of these together to make something like the one above.
