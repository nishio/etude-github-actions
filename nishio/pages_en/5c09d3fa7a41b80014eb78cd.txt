direct quotation
>In the Kofun period of our country, there is a unique pattern called "straight arc". For some reason, there is no similar example of this pattern in other countries, and no one in Japan has inherited it since the latter half of the 6th century. The pattern consists of two diagonal lines and a strip of tape intertwined with a nearly square frame.
