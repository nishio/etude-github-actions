The key word is judged to be "between."
I did my best to interpret it to mean "human" and replied, but of course the "human" in that reply also includes the "pause", so it is counted again.

phenomenological observation
code::
 0> What is the "frequency" of this "frequency"?
 1> I thought the question asking about the relationship between two keywords didn't come up much lately, so I checked it out and found that it doesn't come up much anymore due to a bug fix.

 1> A hook that is thrown at a human being to hook and pull out what is not yet verbalized in that human being and make him verbalize it.

Hmmm, I have a feeling this case simply can't be done at a discount!
ã€€By that point, "between" usually appears twice as a keyword, and the score is over 100, 2nd place.
ã€€Already asked various questions in response to the #1 "question".
ã€€Even if the "between" score is not added, the question is eligible for the last-minute bonus just because it is determined to have appeared immediately before the "between" score.
ã€€ã€€If it is not considered as an appearance, the "fish hook" that appeared immediately before wins.
ã€€ã€€	code::
ã€€ã€€1> A hook that is thrown at a human being to hook and pull out what is not yet verbalized in that human being and make him verbalize it.
    DEBUG:server.keicho.action:* 267.40 What is this "pause"?
    DEBUG:server.keicho.action:* 400.40 What kind of "hook" is that "hook"?
	The one that was actually deemed to appear
	ã€€4:Question, 4:Do, 3:Chat, 3:Be, 2:Talk, 2:Appear, 2:Come, 1:Between, 1:Be with, 1:Partner, 1:Feel, 1:Impact, 1:Person, 1:Program, 1:Become`.
	ã€€Hmmm, limit it to 3 or more letters or `3:chat, 2:come up, 1:be a partner, 1:program`.
