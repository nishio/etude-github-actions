Multiple people think
The focus of this book is on "things that can be done by one person. This is because it is difficult to use methods that require other people from the very first step. On the other hand, there are times when efficient intellectual production can be achieved through discussions with multiple people. I was curious to know when this happens. I found some clues in the discussion on the design of [group work] at [CUMOT2019].

	It's easier to think with more than one person than it is to think alone, which is why we do [group work]."
	But the observational fact is that some people don't see the benefit of group work."
	"How can you understand the benefit of thinking with more than one person if you don't first think until you hit [the wall] alone?"
	"The advantage of more than one person is that it forces [a change in perspective] and allows [a fresh look], thereby breaking down barriers."
	'So first you have to think to the limit alone.'
	If you listen to something very difficult early in the lecture, and you can't figure it out on your own, then you do group work, there's more incentive to talk to each other about what you don't understand."
		'There's no incentive to discuss things when you're listening to something you can understand on your own, when you're doing group work.'
