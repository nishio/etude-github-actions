>The most important resource in reading a book is motivation, so it is important that it is already there and ready to read the moment you decide to read it. If you order it and wait for it to arrive, you'll lose valuable motivation while you wait.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1469159849867227137]: By this logic, of course, there is no reason to pile up e-books that you can buy instantly, and you shouldn't store paper books in a way that you can't take them out instantly when you want to read them! That would be a no-no! Buy paper books, cut and scan them and stack them!
