>The more you learn, the more you realize how ignorant you are. The more I realize my ignorance, the more I want to [learn].
>As it is learned, you make realize how long one is ignorant more.  As I notice my ignorance, I feel like learning further more.
[Einstein] #Quotes

False [mental model] that "the more you learn, the less you know."
	 It is only possible under limited conditions, such as a fixed curriculum [schooling].

When you learn
	There will be more roads.
 More goals.

	The image of moving on foot makes it look like you can only move in a land area, so it's better to compare it to a route map, etc.
		State of walking between home and elementary school.
		A state where you learn that there are many different towns outside of your walking distance, and you get to know the route map and take the train to the station where you want to live.
	 A state in which you learn that there are other prefectures and countries, and figure out how to travel by bullet train, air, etc., to the country in which you want to live.

	The world as I perceive it is expanding.
 Therefore, the number of places I have been to is increasing and the number of places in the world I have never been to is decreasing, yet the number of "places I recognize and have never been to" is increasing

	There's a lot of "not even knowing."
 'Things you don't even know you don't know,' 'Things you know you don't know but could know if you needed to,' 'Things you know you don't know and don't know how to know.'
 	Towns I've never been to and don't even know exist.
  I've never been to Nippori, but you can just take the Yamanote line, if you want to go there.
  How do I get to Antarctica?

		If you wanted to know, read this book, and you'll find out.

	I wonder if the mental model of learning and not knowing less is like this diagram?

		This diagram doesn't really fit.

			[Yoshiki Shibukawa] Sometimes there are new goals, new paths, and more and more things. There are two types of ignorance: "knowing what you don't know" and "not even knowing what you don't know.
		At the moment, the image is something like "when you look at a route map, you learn that there are many stations that you don't know about.

	 There are so many things that "we don't even know we don't know," and I'm struggling with how to make it clear to them.
	 Things we don't even know we don't know, things we know we don't know but could know if we needed to, things we know we don't know and don't know how to know, etc..."
	 If I draw a map, it looks like I can't warp and can only travel by land, so I guess I'll have to compare it to a route map.
 [Yoshiki Shibukawa] "I know what I don't know, but I can learn it as soon as I need it. I often start working on something I don't know and stop when I get to the point where I know it.
 	[nishio.icon] How did you know that you were "ready to know when you need it"?
	 [Yoshiki Shibukawa] When I was introduced to a book that I should read, I put it on my Amazon wish list and left it there. You don't know where to start, and once you know what books to read, what websites to translate, what languages to master, etc., you are in this state. After that, if the situation changes, like I want to make something as a hobby that might use that technology, or I want to write a book while studying it (I got a good feeling from talking to an editor), then I put it in the execution queue with a higher priority.
	[I had an image of something like that.

An old joke.
If you have someone who claims to have mastered C++ and someone who says he doesn't know C++ at all, the latter is the advanced one."
	Related: [Dunning-Kruger effect].

The difference between the speed at which the world expands and the speed at which knowledge is acquired
	Receive the feeling that "the more you learn, the less you know" when the world is expanding at a faster rate.
 	Some people have their hearts broken.
  Do we need to switch to a positive view that we have discovered unexplored territory?
