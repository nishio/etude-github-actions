	There is no way you can use difficult technology if you can't use simple technology. We should see if we can't solve the problem with simple technology, and use it only where we really should solve the problem with difficult technology...
 However, I can sympathize with engineers who are driven by "I want to try out the latest fad" and rush into unnecessary technologies as a way of learning, and I think it is much better than those who do not learn. However, even if management does not appreciate it from a business standpoint, it is still "that's right.
 But going back to the original tweet, there are apparently many people who are fooled by "the bottom of the bottom," so maybe there is a happy co-dependence between engineers who are curious about the fancy buzzword techniques and managers who can't properly evaluate the technology and evaluate it by the buzzword content.
 I'd like to work more and more to destroy that kind of codependence.
