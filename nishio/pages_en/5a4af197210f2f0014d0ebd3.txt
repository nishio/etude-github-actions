 Why is that?" ([why]) repeatedly [digging deeper], you will eventually reach [the limits of science], and when you get further answers to "why" from there, you will obtain [scientific] findings. Image of dividing.
 On the other hand, when you have something you want to make or realize and you ask yourself, "How can I make it?" ([how]), we attach them together by saying, "Let's combine this and that.
 Sometimes the result of attaching is different from what was [expected]. At that time, we can gain [engineering] knowledge by thinking, "Why is it different from what we expected? By actually taking action, you will notice [blind spots].


	Right-side thinking and left-side thinking are not antithetical.
  The figure expresses that there is also a "digging down" phase in the right side of the idea, which is aimed at ascending
  Conversely, there is a phase in the left side of the concept, which is not drawn but is intended to dig deeper, where "[experiments]" are conducted to "see what should happen if this hypothesis is correct" and the results are seen. This is the same as on the right side.
  They zigzag along with each other.
