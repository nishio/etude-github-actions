Pride makes us throw away our options.
	When a hand is extended to you, you [brush it away].
	Rationally speaking, even if there is no need to brush off a [choice], [pride] and other [emotions] cause us to brush it off.
	It is difficult to grab the hand again once it has been swept away
		The damage to pride is even greater.
		When there is no strong incentive to reach out, it is natural to keep your distance
			Never try to pet [a dog that bites] again.
