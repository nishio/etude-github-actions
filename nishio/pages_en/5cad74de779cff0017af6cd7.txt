Share what you don't know
I thought at [ScrapboxSQUARE#2].
	It is useful to be able to share the feeling of "I don't know" without shame

		In Scrapbox, all you have to do is bracket [unfamiliar words] in other people's writing.
			With many tools, when you don't understand a word in someone else's statement, you ask, "What does that X mean?" is a psychological hurdle to ask the question.
				But to leave it unacknowledged is very much lowering [the quality of communication].
				The person using the word thinks, "Of course it should be understood without explanation," or "It should be understood because no questions are asked."
					I wrote about this story in [abbreviation survey needed].
				[Some people are] afraid to say, "I don't know."
				 Mechanisms to alleviate fear are important.
		In the culture of a well-run Scrapbox team, there appears to be a shared perception that bracketing words in other people's sentences is a "good thing"
