There is no guarantee that the door that is open now will remain open in the future.
There are those who superficially see this as a [natural] word, and there are those who [have] it down pat.

When some people see an open door, they think, "Oh, that's a nice door, I'll go in next time," while others think, "Oh, that's a nice door, I'll go in now because it might be closed soon.

concrete example

	I was planning to attend an idol event next time and they broke up.
