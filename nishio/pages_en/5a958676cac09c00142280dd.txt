luck or luck of the draw
[The "luck" or "ability" argument is an incorrect dichotomy to begin with.
To use a mahjong analogy, if you learn the correct theory and play properly, you will have a better chance of winning when most people are playing tsumo kiri, aiming for kokuji muso, or aiming for tan yao because they went up with tan yao the last time.
And an increased winning percentage does not mean that you always win; sometimes you lose by luck.

Just as the vocabulary of Go is useful when talking about big picture strategy, the vocabulary of Mahjong is useful when talking about [strategy] in the context of [stochastic events] happening.
