　Thoughts.
　　The problem of finding the mean of the number of numbers whose difference between two neighbors is d for a sequence of length m in n^m ways.
　　If we can find the time of m-1, we can find the time of m
　　　Because the increment is determined independently of the m-1 state.
　　I thought it was an expected value DP, but since it doesn't depend on the immediately preceding situation, it can be simply multiplied.
　　Number of cases where the difference between two values is d
　　　n when d=0
　　　2(n-d) when d<=n
　　Columns of length m have pair m-1
　　　When d=0 [$ (m-1)/n]
　　　When d<=n [$ 2(m-1)(n-d)/n^2]
