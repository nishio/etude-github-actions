It is a good idea to have someone look at the proposal and give their opinion (review).
If you have someone close to you whom you trust, be proactive and ask for a review.
However, Unexplored Juniors will not be reviewing proposals as an official part of the program. It would make the document review process unfair and too much of a burden on the mentors.

As an irregular example, suppose you are acquainted with a mentor at Unexplored Junior and that mentor has told you that he/she is willing to personally review your proposal. In this case, you are free to request a review, but in principle that mentor cannot be involved in your review. This is also to prevent the review from becoming unfair.
Ask those around you to review as much as possible.
