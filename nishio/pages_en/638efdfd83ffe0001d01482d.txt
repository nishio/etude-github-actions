　For C, A comes first, B comes after.

　For D, B comes first, A comes after.

If we assume the existence of an absolute time line, then either A or B is first.
Apart from that, A and B are the "creators" and C and D are the "observers"

C might claim to B that he is "slower than A".
But to begin with.
　C is just a consumer, not a producer.
　C is slower than B, not A.


I wonder what this leads to...
[Communication]
[Transmission speed]
[Propagation]
[Spread]
[People who think they are superior to others by criticizing them].
