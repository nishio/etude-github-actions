Q: When is it necessary to point people in a discussion?
A: When pointing out that different viewpoints see things differently[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　In many cases, "[viewpoint]" does not have a name and can only be expressed in the form of "whose viewpoint".
　So, for example, we need to use expressions such as "From your point of view, X ≈ Y, but from my point of view, X ≠ Y, which can be compatible.

 	　(from [What is a semantic intersection?)
　Looking back at past examples, when I started using "you" in discussions, it was often accompanied by references to "[range of observation]," "[understanding]," "[interpretation]," "[subjectivity]," and other "things tied to the individual"
　Organized about [point of view]: [from A's point of view B is X, but from B's point of view A is also X].
