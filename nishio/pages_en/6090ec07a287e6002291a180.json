 - No make, no gcc, no g++.
 -- The old MacBook has /usr/bin/gcc and /usr/bin/ghc, and the new side has /usr/bin/ghc but no gcc. I'm wondering if they're blacklisted from the restore.
 -- I have no choice but to install Xcode. It is very large, even though its capacity is very limited! By the way, Xcode is of course restored from the old one, so I don't need the whole Xcode. I wish I could download only gcc or something that is blacklisted.
 -- When I try to download Xcode4, I get an error and cannot download it even though I am logged into ADC and clicked on the download link. I'm not sure what's going on. Either it's free or it's not.
 -- I downloaded Xcode3 and when I try to install it, it says I need to update my OS.
 -- Applied software update and installed Xcode. I was able to use "make" without any problems.
