Taskshoot Experience
>I found that the document tasks I estimated to take "10 minutes to spare" took 14 and 17 minutes respectively, that replying to an e-mail I thought "3 minutes is enough" took 7 minutes, and that I spent 3 minutes every time I went to the bathroom, even though I thought it took 0 minutes, It is surprisingly time-consuming for many things.
>On days with a lot of emails and paperwork, I thought I was losing time quickly and not getting any work done at all, but that's because [the estimate] is off on the low side.
