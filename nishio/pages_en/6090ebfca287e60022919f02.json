 *1229582484* Culdcept DS Commentary
 It turns out that quite a few people at the Python year-end party are actually playing and interested in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B000Y9EGGG?ie=UTF8&tag=978-05824169-22& linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B000Y9EGGG">Culdcept DS</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.jp/e/ir?t=978-05824169- 22&l=as2&o=9&a=B000Y9EGGG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />About affiliate I'll try to explain it lightly.
 
 For those who know Monopoly, the explanation is easy. Roughly speaking, Monopoly is a game in which you can buy some of the squares in a Sugoroku board when you stop at them to make them your territory, and you can take tolls when other players stop at your territory. The game is played by building houses, hotels, and other structures to raise the level of the game and increase the revenue by raising the tolls and aiming for more revenue. Culdcept is similar in that when a player stops at one of the squares in a Sugoroku puzzle, he or she consumes magic power to summon a creature (monster) to make it his or her territory, and when another player stops there, he or she can take magic power as a toll. And the first player to return to the starting point after the total amount of assets reaches a certain amount wins.
 
 The main difference between Monopoly and Culdcept is that you can level up land without first having to do a "monopoly of the same color". In Monopoly, you cannot level up unless you can negotiate and create a monopoly, but in Culdcept, you can level up even if you only have one piece of land. But of course, if you have more than one land of the same color, the toll goes up; once you have two lands, the toll is 1.5 times higher than when you have one.
 
 Another major difference is that land ownership is represented by "creatures sitting on the land. In Monopoly, for example, if there is a hotel on a certain piece of land, it is a "very strong and helpless piece of land," and you have to roll the dice and hope it doesn't stop. But even if you stop at a land with max level, if you have a creature card in your hand, you can start a battle before paying the toll. If you defeat the creature sitting there, not only do you not have to pay the toll, but the whole high level land becomes yours. You may think, "But after all, what can I do if the strongest creature is guarding it?" But there is no creature that cannot be defeated. If you have a fire creature in a fire land and it is an undead creature, you can kill it with a single blow by using the "Holy Symbol," an item that kills undead creatures instantly. Or, for example, you can avoid paying the toll by using a paralyzing creature or item. There are also spell cards that can be used to attack other cells besides the one where you are stopped, and you can use them to defeat them. You can also use a move spell card to move a creature to a neighboring land.
 
 There are many choices like this, but since this "hand" is drawn at random from the 50 cards selected before the game, there are many things to think about, such as how to choose the cards, what is the best thing to do in the current situation with the cards you actually drew, and so on. What is the best thing to do in the current situation? No wonder it's popular with programmers.
 
 A few last things. Unlike Monopoly, there is no negotiated land exchange. There is a story mode with a series of enemies that gradually get stronger, and you can learn more about it by playing it than by the description here. There is also a map where there is a "talisman", a kind of stock whose price goes up and down in relation to the value of the land. Some maps have "hokora," which are random events like Monopoly's common fund. You can also play against other players, up to 4 players. Even if you lose, you can get 8 cards, so it is not difficult to complete your card collection. You can also play as a team, so if the AI is not enough for you, you can play two against one. That's about all I have to say about it.
 
 *1229615688* Clean up & build shelves
 I'm going to clean up this area today.

 I received the shelves.
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20081218154339j:image
 
 Small work space.
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20081218162149j:image
 
 Store the tower that was left in the middle of the hallway.
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20081218163115j:image
 
 Just as planned. Perfectly.

 Lowering entropy in one place raises entropy in other areas. You can't go against thermodynamics.

 Oh, it fits perfectly. I was able to reuse some of the previous shelves.

 After all this time, I'm starting to feel that it was a mistake not to replace the feet with casters. With casters, I can pull them out and around to the back when I need to do wiring. (Assuming, of course, that the front of the shelf is clear.
