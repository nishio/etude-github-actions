Spoiler Explanation
　Although it looks exactly like Homo sapiens, this alien has genitalia in its hands, and exposing its hands in public is an immoral act.
　What a handshake is to Homo sapiens appears to be an act of reproduction to these aliens.
　　On Earth, an act of friendship -> You have sex to show friendship!　would be an act of friendship
　　　And they do [bonobos] and stuff like that.
　Aliens come to visit and trade with us for a handshake.
　　On Earth, they walk around with their hands exposed and openly shake hands.
　　= From the alien perspective, it becomes "walking around with exposed genitals and openly engaging in sexual activity."
　It was a big deal when the handshake revealed that earthlings could conceive an alien child.
