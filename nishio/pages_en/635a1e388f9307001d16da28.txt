Why lose touch when things are not getting done that need to be done?
>[https://twitter.com/Love_yellowhat/status/1584821438552604672 @Love_yellowhat]: why do students lose touch when they are not getting what they need to do? It's when you're in a tight spot that it's better to contact them early so the wounds are less severe.

>so they try to fall on the side that has the slightest chance of not having a wound because they can only measure it by whether there is a wound or not. (Because if you miraculously make a big turnaround, you can act as if nothing went wrong.)
