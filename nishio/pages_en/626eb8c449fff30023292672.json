>All intellectual property rights related to the products developed by Unexplored Junior belong to the creators.

It is important to note that it is "intellectual property rights" not "copyrights." This means that it is not limited to copyrights, but includes patents, etc.

The reason is that during the junior unexplored period, mentors and other creators will come up with various ideas for the creator's project, and without clear regulations, the invention created there will become a joint invention, and the rights cannot be exercised without the consent of all those involved in the invention.

This is a stance that has not changed since the unexplored projects were created.
Nishio believes the same should be done when mentoring creators for their proposed projects.
