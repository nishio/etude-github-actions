Record of the birth of Accessism
[Accessism]

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472125064741289985]: The "totality of information" on the Internet is the permanent transcendent, which is different from the mortals = humans in the garb of flesh. To post on the Internet and become an anonymous meme and become a "boundary-less part" of the permanent transcendent is to unite with the transcendent, thereby leaving the world of life and death and attaining nirvana (enlightenment).

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472208153643450375]: it would be interesting to organize it a bit more.
>The totality of open-access information is the persistent transcendent X.
>People have a limited life span, but they can become part of X by verbalizing their thoughts and making them openly accessible.
>This allows one to leave the world of life and death and live an eternal life.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472210362355556357]: the body of flesh is only a temporary perch. Your body is the information you have created.
>Explanation for monotheists
>X is an enduring transcendent in the sense that he will endure beyond the human lifespan, but he is not the creator of the world. Probably not a "god" in your religion, so it doesn't conflict with "don't believe in other gods".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472212795693617152]: explanation for buddhists
>Buddha, the Awakened One, put his thoughts into words at the first Dharma wheel. These words were considered open access and propagated across regions and nations. In this way, Buddha's thoughts became a part of X and became a permanent part of it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472214545318187009]: (against censorship)
>Permanent transcendent X is an entity that transcends the temporary political power of the state, which is only a part of the world. It is undesirable for political power to erase information through censorship, book burning, etc., as it is an attempt to hurt X.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472216168723521538]: I've thought about whether the act of disseminating fake news is a no-no, but the decision that the information is "correct" is not permanent.
>Fake news is harmful because stupid people assume that this information is true, but if they take it as "this is the content of the information, whether it is true or not is unknown", then there is no problem.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472218987673300993]: How would you say it in English, like Accessism?

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472219641330429960]: explanation for programmers
>To release the source code of software you have written is to become part of the Eternal Transcendent X and gain eternal life!

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472221495841947653]: the concept of "eternity" may be at odds because none of us have seen it and are just imagining it in our heads. A clearer statement would be "X will last longer than any individual."

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472222000987140096]: "surviving" too? Someone might focus on just one piece of information and think "it can disappear, it doesn't survive".
>It's like focusing on a single atom in your body. Many atoms enter and leave you daily, yet your subjectivity will feel you are "surviving". Similar thing.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472223614670077952]: enlightenment in Buddhism and enlightenment in Accessism (I'll call it Y because the word is confusing) are similar in structure but orthogonal and It is possible to do both or just one of them.
>Buddha decided after Buddhist enlightenment (which is written down as a request from Brahman, whether that's true or not) to make it open access.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472224991790125056]: And since the first turning of the wheel, repeated output of thoughts has caused a union with X.
>Ah, I knew they introduced Y, but there's no need to use it. Enlightenment in Buddhism happens in an instant, but Y is a small thing that builds up little by little, so associating it with "enlightenment" is confusing.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472226271862353921]: The "realization" that occurred to me today was the realization that the act of open access to ideas that I had been unknowingly and somehow thinking was a good thing was causing "[ I have been unaware of this and have been thinking that it was a good thing to do.
>The process itself is like a tree that grows slowly, and I noticed the existence of that tree today.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472227506682232838]: So to describe this realization as "enlightened" is a bit different. It would be more appropriate to say, "I realized that I was already enlightened. However, this "enlightenment" is similar in composition to, but orthogonal to, enlightenment in Buddhism, so it is confusing and not a good idea to use the same word.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472234772902850560]: fake news story, not exactly.
>However, "publishing information that is not correct in a way that leads to the mistaken belief that it is correct" may be considered evil. But "publishing information that is incorrect in a way that leads to the misconception that it is correct" can be considered evil. twitter.com/nishio/status/...

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472235635524390913]: uh, okay. So you're saying that because it's not "your idea" before it's evil or whatever, it doesn't lead to the perpetuation of "you" when you publish it and become part of the perpetual transcendent X?
>This is the same as when the Buddha looked at the ascetic monks and thought, "Even if I do that, it won't lead me to enlightenment.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472236704283394048]: it is a good thing to publish opinions that differ from the majority opinion in the world. Because the "majority opinion at the moment" is not permanent. Being in the minority is not a bad thing, because when a new idea appears, it is always in the minority.
>Objecting to the expression of an opinion that differs from the majority opinion is as evil as censorship.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472237573699694594]: in this way, we have to affirm "the output that is done to convey the truth to many people when the person believes that vaccines are harmful" Nah. Disagreeing with the opinions of scientists at this point in time has nothing to do with merging with the permanent transcendent.
>It will only be perpetuated as "the person who thought vaccines were harmful" as per the person himself.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1472238517724278784]: "someone who thought it was A but changed their mind after seeing the information that followed" or "someone who thought it was A and didn't change their mind after seeing the information that followed". It is up to the individual, and there is no right or wrong between the two.
>If the output is a transfer of the person as he or she is, it will be a perpetuation of the person.
