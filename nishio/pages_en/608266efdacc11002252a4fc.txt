I want to send books easily
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1384789247845015554]: i wish Amazon would make a coupon that would allow you to send a specific book directly instead of a gift certificate. Like, "I wonder if this book would be of interest to you?" I wish I could pay for it instead of making them pay when I send them a message saying, "I wonder if this book might be of interest to you?", and I'm wondering if there's an easy way to do that.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1384792576805330944]: Instead of putting what the recipient wants on the list in advance, the sender selects a product, sends a link, and the recipient can choose "Do you want to receive this book? If the recipient chooses "Yes", the book will be delivered to the recipient for free.

>[igrep https://twitter.com/igrep/status/1384792094837854209]: I've had coworkers give me things that weren't on my list when I had a public wish list, so I can do it if they have a public wish list. I think I can do it if I have a public wish list.
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1384793386729623552]: it would be nice if we had a society where everyone published their wish lists...
