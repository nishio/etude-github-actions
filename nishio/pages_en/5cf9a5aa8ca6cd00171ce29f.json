BOT exit messages and their side effects
In heroku, the server will shut down in 30 minutes if there is no access.
So I added a function to bots deployed on heroku that sends "sleeping..." when it finishes. at the end of the deployment.
code:python
 import atexit
 @atexit.register
 def exit():
     requests.post("<URL>", json=dict(text="(heroku)sleeping..."))

But this message is sent to heroku, and as soon as I go to sleep, it wakes me up.

I was wasting my free slots by repeatedly going to sleep and waking up every 30 minutes throughout the night, so I decided to quit.
