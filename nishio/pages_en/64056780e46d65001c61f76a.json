About Self-Introduction
I'm not comfortable wearing [the medal].
	The "medal" here is "[a] good-looking label."
	D. at the age of 24 after skipping three classes," or "I've authored four books," or "I'm a member of the board of directors of the Unexplored Foundation."
	Even if it [looks good], it's just [labeling].
		The act of doing [labeling people in a crude manner] to yourself.

And I thought about where that [resistance] came from.
 I thought it was because I felt the value of the "good looking label" was low compared to [my value].
 And others don't understand this "what I consider 'my value'".
 　By default, it only recognizes you as "one of many."
 　So if you want people to understand the value, you have to [output your own value].
 　Most people can only judge others by the quality and quantity of their medals.
 　Some people can be judged without medals if they communicate.
 　　However, there are only a limited number of people with whom he/she can "take the time to communicate".
 　　Medals are also beneficial to increase the probability of being selected for a limited number of "targets".
 Some people believe that their "self-worth" is increased by the medal.
 　Such people are inferior to the Order of Merit.
	 　Such people actively promote their medals.

　So I don't want to spend the time.
　So I keep a stock of what I've made in the past and cut and paste it for myself and others to use.

I tend to cut off my introduction a lot, even when I'm giving a talk or something.
　I have something to say and don't want to consume the limited time I have to say it with sterile introductions.
