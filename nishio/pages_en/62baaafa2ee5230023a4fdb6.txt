　Contents
　　[I'm unclear on the definition of "comfortable place.
 　[Vegetables and culinary parables]
 　[Parable of the water pipe and the water storage tank].
　About the Process
　　Is this Kozaneba process an "exploratory net"?
　　The purpose is to use the Internet so that when you read the text beyond the book, it's easier to position it as, "Oh, that's the one."
　　　You could say we're creating [coordinate knowledge].
　　There are significant differences in terms of methodology.
　　　In the exploratory net, I do the "pick about 10 pieces that don't have much to do with each other and place them in space first" thing.
　　　The process I'm doing is chopped up sentences, head to head.
　　　　Equivalent to chronological order in fieldwork
　　　It's possible to do the "place 10 unrelated pieces first" thing, so let's try that this time.
　　Time spent
　　　2 Pomodoro making labels while reading a book.
　　　1 pomodoro to place it in two dimensions.

The surface is stronger than the line
Assemble in a plane shape
Space placement on paper

You can do it using the KJ method.
Busy daily life
Speedy illustration
Time savings
A coarse understanding is sufficient at this stage.
I devised a way to do this.
Expedition Net
fireworks
Big blank sheet of paper
For No. 6 labels, imitation paper or half-sheet
No. 4 label would be A4 or B4.
Take the label apart.
Labels that have different meanings from each other as much as possible
I pick up about 10 pieces.
After carefully savoring the meaning of each piece.
spatial arrangement
　see KJ method
preliminary loading of the (cargo) ship (in preparation for moving cargo around inside the ship)
Because there's a possibility of moving it.
I don't do it nervously.
Rigor is not required.
Remaining labels

The more it increases, the harder it is to understand.

Hard to tell from the relationship lines alone.

When enclosed, add a description of the contents.
Faceplates in the KJ method
Rigor is not required.
rather
logo
Indicates a focused "feel" of the content
It can be a short phrase.
　for some reason
　That's because the KJ method "bundles" so you need to know what's inside just by the nameplate.
　　We need to know what's in it without looking at it.
　Stay open for fireworks.
　　So there's no need to write what you can see.
All finished placing.
No more need to reorder.

Many people mistook it for the KJ method.

Wrong purpose.

To converge data

Loose convergence

Functional similarities and dissimilarities
Group of disparate labels

go with the flow
Associative ideas are easy to diverge.
water pipe
Water flows more easily.
Water pipe network
Water is more likely to gush out from various locations in search of new flow paths.
network of relational lines
Makes it easier to generate new ideas.
therefore
Add ideas as you network
Improved brainstorming

As the number of sheets increases.
The advantage of the relationship line is weakened.
It's hard to get a full picture.
