[Technology behind coding English check] I'll do it on the weekend.
	Saturday I just did 1 pomodoro to look at what's available without working on it, then 4 pomodoro and then 4 pomodoro, plus a lazy one to finish the second half of 6 chapters. I'll do the other half tomorrow (actually less than half the amount, and the content will be easier, so it should be less burdensome).
