DF with length as a parameter
When the [DF] of a word is 0.1
It's like saying that the probability of appearance is 1 in 10 documents.
The probability of appearance p is naturally higher the longer the document is.
I think it is strange to think that p is a function of the word w only.
Wouldn't it be better to build a model that estimates p from document length n and word w?
