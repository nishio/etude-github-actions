[It all started with hand-drawn cards. Interview with the developer of "Shephy-Shephy," a "one-player game to increase the number of sheep" that came to smartphones. https://www.4gamer.net/games/347/G 034733/20160711091/]
	>Furuya: The idea of digitizing "Sheffi" came to me when I found the additional rule "Sheffi Postravs" ("Postravs") with a story published on the official website. In the rules, there is a behavior of "replacing certain cards," but I forgot about it when I was actually playing. So I thought, "If I could digitize this, it would be easier to play.

	>Mr. Pawn: I created about 30 event cards in a flash, and when the system took shape, I settled on a form that I thought might be quite interesting. That was "The race of thousand sheep" ("Trots"), the prototype of "Sheffi". At that time, I published the cards I had made and the rules on the website and was satisfied that I had done a good job. The details of this process are available on my personal website as [Designer's Notebook http://stst.cocot.jp/other/log2014/shephynote.html].
