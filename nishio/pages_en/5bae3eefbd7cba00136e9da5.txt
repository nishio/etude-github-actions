Boredom and overlearning
	Neural nets tend to be treated inhumanly, being forced to [learn] the same data repeatedly, regardless of their intentions.
 	[Neural Net Abuse]
 In the case of humans, they think they are [bored], they are bored, and they lower the weights.
 	I think they are avoiding [overlearning] by [getting bored].
 Conversely, when unfamiliar or unexpected phenomena occur, they are more interested and focused [curiosity].
 Automatically decreases the learning coefficient for data with high [predictability] and increases it when a different phenomenon occurs than predicted.
  It seems to be related to [acclimation] explained on p.84 and [adaptive boosting] explained on p.88 in [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers].
