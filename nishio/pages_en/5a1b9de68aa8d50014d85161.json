It is risk-taking, not intelligence, that creates new things.
 It is not intelligence that creates new things [risk-taking].
  Nature has created a wide variety of shapes and systems through random mutations.
   No intelligence is involved here.
   There is a [risk] of death by random mutation.
  Intelligence can only be involved in the a posteriori selection and resource allocation of randomly generated items.

 Random mutations of nature, of course, carry the risk that the individual will die.
  Dying is a process of natural selection
 The mutation process, especially without scope, is very time consuming.
 Intelligence can contribute to search efficiency by narrowing the scope of search, preliminarily
  However, this limitation on the scope of exploration often squelches the seeds for new ones to emerge.
  Difficult [trade-off].

	And by the way, nature isn't blindly making random mutations either.
 	There are mechanisms to raise and lower the mutation rate.
  Repeat sequences increase the frequency of recombination occurrence in that area.
