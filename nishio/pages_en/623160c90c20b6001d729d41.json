I wonder how I can make it stronger...
I guess I need to improve my ability to understand the state of the deck.

I went to bed and woke up and thought, well, I've never used it and I've never gone through it, and then I looked at the Wiki for the messenger, and this has a cantrip on it, so when you draw a messenger with a messenger, you get 2 draws and 2 actions, which equals a village plus an institute.
This is a "card that performs an action without spending an action", so its power comes into play in situations where you have a terminal action in your hand and on top of the deck.
With that in mind, there are decks with a high action ratio and the option to load them with precursors.

Maybe it would be better to set the goal to "have used all the cards at least once" rather than to set an unfamiliar goal like "improve my ability to figure out the deck."
