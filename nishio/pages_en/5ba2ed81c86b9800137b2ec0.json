In times when [demand] is clear and [supply] is scarce,
	It is clear what to make
 The more you make, the more you sell.
 The more they make, the lower the cost per unit tends to be [mass-produced].
 The race is on to lower production costs.
 There will also be a race to improve quality.

	You'll need to find a client.

  [GAME TIME]
	Mass production" and "cost reduction," which had been regarded as good until then, became a hindrance.
 	Not necessarily bad, but "finding customers quickly" is paramount [Lean Startup].
  It is not a good idea to allocate too many resources by past practice to things that do not contribute to finding customers quickly.
  It will be necessary to break past patterns [double-loop learning].

When you discover a gold mine of promising customers, everyone gets in on the action and the race to meet demand begins again!
