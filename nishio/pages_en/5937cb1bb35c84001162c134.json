   Usage notes
    Some consider proactive to be a buzzword, and it is associated with business-speak. Depending on use, alternatives include active, or “show initiative” instead of “be proactive”.
    Some consider this term a buzzword. I was a bit skeptical too, since I learned about it via a consulting friend. (See "Night and Fog" below for the source.) Well, even if that is the case, the fact that proactive and reactive are synonymous forms of the word is rather helpful for thinking.
			Etymology
    pro- +‎ active; originally coined 1933 by Paul Whiteley and Gerald Blankfort in a psychology paper, used in technical sense. Used in a popular context and sense (courage, perseverance) in 1946 book Man’s Search for Meaning by neuropsychiatrist Viktor Emil Frankl, in the context of dealing with the Holocaust, as contrast with reactive.
