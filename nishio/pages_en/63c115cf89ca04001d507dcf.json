Resolution: Uncaught TypeError: use_force_update_1.default is not a function

2023-01-13 Kozaneba now gives the following runtime error in the browser, even though it was built and deployed without error
 `Uncaught TypeError: use_force_update_1.default is not a function`

cause
　I rebuilt the environment for the first time in six months at [Create Kozaneba's development environment].
　Latest [react-scripts] and [use-force-update] used internally by [ReactN] conflict.
　The latter offers both esm and cjs, a bug that prevents the former from properly understanding the situation, the latter author claims!
 　>Downgrade react-scripts to ^4 until they resolve it in ^5.
  >Downgrade use-force-update to 1.0.8.

Resolution (for [Yarn]1)
	Downgraded use-force-update
　code:package.json
  {
    "resolutions": {
      "use-force-update": "1.0.8"
    }
  }
　There are other solutions on Github.
