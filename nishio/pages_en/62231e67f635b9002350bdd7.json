Atomic pages are large in Scrapbox.
from [/unnamedcamp/Scrapbox has large atomic pages].
old title:
	Appropriate atomicity is great in Scrapbox.
	The proper balance of atomicity is greater in Scrapbox than advocates assume.

　The concept of [atomic] didn't feel right, so I translated the original English text.
　[/nishio/evergreen note should be atomic].
		Proponents of evergreen notes explain that "if the note is too broad -" and "if the note is too fragmented
		In other words, the argument that it's better to strike the right balance.
		That "proper balance" may be greater in Scrapbox than advocates assume.
		In "If the Notebook is Too Wide," it says: "If the Notebook is Too Wide, it's too Wide.
			A: For one of several ideas in the notebook, it is difficult to notice when you come across a related new idea
			B: The link to the note is ambiguous
		　B seems to implicitly assume that a link to a note leads to the beginning of that note
		　　That appears to be the system that advocates are actually using.
		　Scrapbox's ability to scroll to a line link or link position would allow me to point to that part of the page even if multiple thoughts are on one page.
		　A is also mitigated by Scrapbox's feature that links in a page are not "one-way links to other pages" but "a window that can lead to it from other pages as well as the title of the page".
　　In other words, what advocates call "the problem with too much space" is mitigated in Scrapbox
　　　The harm of too much ticking does not seem to be well taken care of in Scrapbox, for example, from the fact that requests to transparently embed other pages are often raised and rejected in the forum
　　　Then wouldn't the proper balance in Scrapbox be to make it larger than the advocates envisioned?
