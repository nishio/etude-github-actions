Where to read the learned model
In model_fn in model_fn_builder
code:python
 if init_checkpoint:
   (assignment_map, initialized_variable_names
    ) = modeling.get_assignment_map_from_checkpoint(tvars, init_checkpoint)
I'm doing it.
	`tvars = tf.trainable_variables()`
	`init_vars = tf.train.list_variables(init_checkpoint)`
	Writing nameâ†’name mapping to assignment_map for each element in init_vars that is included in tvars
		The comment says `"""Compute the union of the current variables and checkpoint variables.""` Isn't that Intersect, not Union?
	Why are we doing this?
		This allows you to read both Pretrained and Fine-tuned models without worrying about

Then there are some branches where you have to put an adapter for the [TPU], but basically
code:python
 tf.train.init_from_checkpoint(init_checkpoint, assignment_map)

	[tf.compat.v1.train.init_from_checkpoint  |  TensorFlow Core r2.0 https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/train/init_from_checkpoint]
		The first argument is a file name, etc.
		assignment_map describes which variables map to which variables

	initialized_variable_names seems to be used only for log display
