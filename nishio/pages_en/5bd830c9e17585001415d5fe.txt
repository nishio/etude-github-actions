90% by luck
[Konosuke Matsushita: "Whether you [succeed] or not is [90%] luck.
	>I am not saying that [fate] is 100 percent. I never said that, but that it is 90 percent. That means the remaining 10 percent is important for human beings.
 >Because luck is 90%, it doesn't mean that you don't have to [try]. And you can't assume that because you put in the effort, you will be successful. But you have to work hard to succeed.
