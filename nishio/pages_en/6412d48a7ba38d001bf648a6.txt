>[ForGamesJapan https://twitter.com/ForGamesJapan/status/1636303952965943296?s=20]Zero One Berth, Koriyama is designing the game. We have been gingerly boiling down the fun of Pasta Logic. We developed the game in order to create a universal fun that can be enjoyed by both those who liked the original and those who are new to the game. Please play and enjoy the unexpectedness of the development created by the six cards.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1636283898639577090?s=20] I thought it was great that Koriyama was able to clean up the overly difficult parts of the original Pasta Logic game and make it "not too easy" for Tokoroten and I to enjoy playing against each other. I thought Koriyama-san was great. I am also looking forward to the single player mode by Mr. Pawn. The world view and flavors are also hot. Highly recommended!

> This is a 2-player game where it feels like each player creates their own programming process and fights! I think you will enjoy quite a brain battle in this game based on Pasta Logic. We are looking forward to your cooperation!
>[TANSANFABRIK https://twitter.com/TANSANFABRIK/status/1638507235314913285] The game design is a very strong triangle of Mr. Koriyama, Mr. Pohn and Mr. Nishio!
> There is also a challenging single player mode.
> By all means!
