 *1357484634* I created a "motivational survey".
 I was tinkering with SurveyMonkey's survey system, and it occurred to me to create a <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20121118/1353244629'>checklist for "annoying" and "unmotivated" situations. </It's just a richer UI, but it's still pretty interesting.

 However, it seems that to reproduce it including jumps and branching, I have to pay 3,000 yen per month for a paid account. Hmmm, I would rather have my own service than continue to pay 3000 yen a month for this.
 
 PS: Oh, someone chose "useful". My last entry got a lot of buzzes, but I wondered if it was actually useful or not, but it's nice to see that it is useful. I'm going to work on the prototype on top of this survey system for a while, and then maybe I'll make it my own service...

 <body>You have to make the form multiple pages, but <br>Google Docs Form allows you to choose which page to go to next depending on your answers. </body>
