[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[/nishio/human.icon]Hopefully thoughts will develop on the relationship between motivational systems and Keichobot.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "Keichobot" is that "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]A system that encourages concretization by asking questions
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "system" is that "system"?
[/nishio/human.icon]A motivational system is a system that motivates by asking questions and giving advice. I think it's a little bit related to asking questions and being specific.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Anything else about that "system"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Motivation systems have been used to a point, but I'm beginning to question my basic premise. I think it's a fallacy to assume that there is such a thing as "motivation," that it's the lack of it that's the problem, and that it's all we need to do to get it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you value?
[/nishio/human.icon]It is good if human beings spend time with a pleasant feeling and produce socially valuable output. Motivation has nothing to do with it. Motivation for a task that produces garbage will only produce garbage efficiently.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "motivation" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]Imaginary resources that many people assume exist
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > Motivational systems have been used to a point, but I'm beginning to question my basic premise. I think the assumption that there is such a thing as "motivation," that the problem is the lack of it, and that it's enough to get it going, is false.
 Where is this "system" located?
[/nishio/human.icon]At the time I made this, I didn't have the concept of serverless yet and realized the app with static delivery and GoogleAnalytics. If we rebuilt it now, we could take richer information for each user and give more appropriate advice.

 How do you know this "system"?
I was going to collect [/nishio/human.icon]data and do machine learning. It turned out to be just an if statement.

 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "motivation"?
[/nishio/human.icon]When the tasks to be done are not clear, or there are multiple tasks to be done but the order of priority is not clear, you will not be able to move forward. If you solve this problem, you will be able to move forward. Sometimes users express this as "I'm not motivated" or "I want to be motivated," but that is a statement that does not grasp their needs, similar to "I want a fast horse.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What does that "motivation" look like?
[/nishio/human.icon] There are several "factors that hinder progress". The presence of them is vaguely described as "lack of motivation. Motivation" is the opposite concept of that, a shadow
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where does that "motivation" come from?
[/nishio/human.icon]Removing obstacles
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > There are a number of "factors preventing progress". The presence of them is vaguely described as "lack of motivation". Motivation" is the opposite concept of that, a shadow of
 How do you know you are "motivated" to do this?
[/nishio/human.icon]I've used Keichobot myself for various purposes, and I've found it "very beneficial to the progress of the project" by breaking down tasks that are too big or breaking the balance of priorities, isn't this what we need?
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "task" is that "task"?
[/nishio/human.icon]What to do. Often it is not clear what to do. Sometimes there is more than one, and then people can only do one at a time, so they need to choose.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > There are a number of "factors preventing progress". The presence of them is vaguely described as "lack of motivation". Motivation" is the opposite concept of that, a shadow of
 Where is this "motivation"?
[/nishio/human.icon]It's like a pore, it doesn't exist.

 > Motivational systems have been used to a point, but I'm beginning to question my basic premise. I think the assumption that there is such a thing as "motivation," that the problem is the lack of it, and that it's enough to get it going, is false.
 Where is this "system" located?
[/nishio/human.icon]No one has yet combined a motivational system with a system that asks questions and provides clarification.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What is the relationship between that "motivation" and the "system"?
[/nishio/human.icon]The system will resolve the inhibited condition.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen regarding that "system"?
[/nishio/human.icon]It's not clear yet how to combine them, so it would be nice to know that.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What needs to happen to the "system" for that to happen?
[/nishio/human.icon]We need to clarify what needs to be clarified by the question
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > The system solves the impeded state.
