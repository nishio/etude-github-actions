Workers with knowledge own the means of production
Summary of [Post-Capitalist Society

 In the past, workers owned the means of production, the labor force.
 Inventions such as the steam engine created costly but overwhelmingly productive machines.
  The time has come for capitalists who can afford to buy the machines to own the means of production.
  This was the result of knowledge application to the tools of the trade.
 Taylor devised scientific management methods and increased productivity by educating and training workers.
  This was the result of the application of knowledge to the physical workers' job descriptions.
 Just as in the past, capitalists who owned machines were considered to own the means of production because "labor power < < labor power + machines," so in the future, workers who possess knowledge will be considered to own the means of production because "labor power + machines < < labor power + machines + knowledge.
