Unclear what subjectivity is.
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521406808417800193]: You say something like "subjectivity is important" and think you've said something, but you're unclear what that "[subjectivity]" is. Isn't it a thoughtless stop to just attribute it to "subjectivity" and be done with it?

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521407120486584321]: For example, right now I am writing about my experience as a mentor for the Junior Unexplored Program in a public forum, not under someone else's direction, which at first glance appears to be a "proactive" activity. This seems to be a "proactive" activity. But what is the reason for this activity?

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521407906910183425]: After digging deeper, I came to the fact that I once received a thank-you note from a creator-support organization regarding this article I had written on the adoption of the MIZUKO JUNIOR. I found that I once received a word of thanks from a creator-supporting organization for this article that I wrote about the adoption of the Unexplored Junior.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521408328655847424]: So the actions you are doing now are "actions that are being done because of approval or rewards from others". What's the difference between "I'm doing this because my mom praises me when I do this" and "I'm doing this because my mom praises me when I do this"? It is simply a misunderstanding that you thought you were acting spontaneously.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521412493587136512]: going back, I think I was spontaneous when I was a freshman in college when I first started my web diary. But I don't think the current Unexplored Junior system of "submit a proposal and get an interview" is useful in supporting that level of activity. Even if there had been an unexplored junior program back then, I wouldn't have submitted it, and even if I had, it wouldn't have passed.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521413537440333827]: So what was beneficial was that the activity was triggered by "a venture that has an office near the university rents a block of servers to students for free. This was beneficial because it was triggered by "you can make your own website, come to the office and work on it".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521414718728339456]: I was given a place where I could freely place Perl CGI and rewrite it myself, so I "played" with it. Maybe it would be good if there were more places of this kind.

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1521417765667880961]: when I'm raising my kids, I think, "Initiative is important, but you have to give them the materials to act independently."
>Of course, you can't look for what you don't know, and you can't execute what you don't have the means to do.
>I think it's the same at work.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521418320519774210]: Yeah, I started doing things here because I learned that "if I write a program in Perl and put it here, I can access it from home with a browser and use it" and "I can create dynamically changing pages instead of just static I started doing a lot of things because I learned that "if I write a program in Perl and use it here, I can access it from home with a browser" and "I can create dynamically changing pages, not just static HTML.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521419302020464640]: When I found out about it, I modified the CGI version of the presentation version to make a cave exploration game. I liked JNetHack at the time, and the idea of being able to write letters on the wall and have them gradually fade away was interesting to me, so I made that happen on an online bulletin board. Well, it wasn't used because I didn't think of the "incentive to write in a messy way".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521419917308080128]: If you think about toddlers, they draw pictures because they have paper and crayons, they make X with clay because they have clay, they make X with Lego bricks because they have Lego bricks ...and so on... it might be normal that "making toys" are given from outside.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521422174573441025]: So Scratch and HackforPlay are good "building toys" and a "place" to show them to others and get feedback. It's a "playground" that comes with a set of "places" to show it to others and get feedback.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521424980684472320]: In my time, I was renting a server, but nowadays we can create both static and dynamic pages for free, so what the heck should I offer? I'm not sure what to offer.
>Well, sharing information for those who don't know that it can be made for free is beneficial, but that only takes a few pages of articles.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521425630499590147]: how did we get to talking about "subjectivity"?

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521426201507954689]: this is another related story though the word is "spontaneity" [unexplored emphasizes spontaneity].

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521426788987305985]: it's good to walk and ponder for an hour about unresolved issues, it's good for exercise, and it's good for an hour's worth of development of unresolved issues. Let's do it again tomorrow. Tomorrow we will do "What is Social Significance?" Scheduled for

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1521431563611041792]: This is also about the disparity between urban and rural areas. Even if you don't have enough money to buy technical books, if you live in a city, you can go to a large bookstore like Junkudo and look at the shelves with a large number of technical books lined up. You can even browse the shelves. On the other hand, there are some people who do not have such large bookstores within their reach.
