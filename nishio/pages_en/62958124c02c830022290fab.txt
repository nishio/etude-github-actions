The point is balance.

I traced the source for the "Uncle Balance in a nutshell" story, and found that it was spoken of in relation to [trade-offs].
　There is no causal relationship between the existence of trade-offs and the need for balance in the first place.
　Implicitly assumes that the maximum of the utility function is not at both ends

>[https://twitter.com/katzchang/status/1171081642955264000 @katzchang]: there is no trade-off structure in the world to speak of, so gathering information often leads to natural conclusions.

 	>[https://twitter.com/katzchang/status/1171081936330059783 @katzchang]: @mizchi If we have a confrontation, just organize the information and we're usually good to go!

>[https://twitter.com/nagise/status/1171193448352739329 @nagise]: without a value weighting presentation, sometimes all you can say is "the bottom line is balance".
>I could be more specific if you could tell me what you value and what kind of balance you're looking for.

I think the key is balance...

>[https://twitter.com/shinpei0213/status/1171216772285878272 @shinpei0213]: The bottom line is that, with regard to Uncle Balance, it is not bad and necessary to find the trade-off structure and say "we have to balance somewhere", but it is not good and necessary to stop there. But it's not good to stop there, and it's not good to say "in this case, we can't move this part, so let's take this part" or in the case of a generalized story, "in this case, it's better to focus on this part, and in that case, it's better to focus on that part". I am of the opinion that this information is valuable.
> I think it's always a trade-off to talk about design, so when I talk about patterns, I have to say "if you want to solve this kind of problem" and "if you want to solve this kind of problem" and "if you dare" to take on the complexity of splitting the pattern to solve any problem.

>[https://twitter.com/songmu/status/1171223594841432064 @songmu]: there's a trap of finding tradeoffs where there aren't tradeoffs and assuming that's where you're going, etc.
	>>[https://twitter.com/ffu_/status/1167095773512683520 @ffu_]: if you guys are serious, we can do it. The fakers are cutting corners on what the tradeoffs are.

I thought that when I read "Mr. Iwata.
