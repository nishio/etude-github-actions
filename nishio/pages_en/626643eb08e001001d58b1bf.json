mitoujr-mentoring-tips
I have had many thoughts and discussions over the years as a mentor for [Unexplored Junior]. If the number of "third places that stimulate children's creativity" like "Unexplored Junior" increases in the future, naturally the number of people who "mentor for the first time" will also increase. So it is beneficial for society to verbalize the experience and share it with those people.

The discussion turned to whether the place for information sharing should be "a place for public information dissemination" or "a place for private two-way communication," and we felt that the former would be a good place to start, so we decided to summarize the results on this page.
	(Nishio's original idea was the latter, but there is [the problem of difficulty in igniting SNS]. It is better to make it a project that can be started by one person first.)

What are "mitoujr-mentoring-tips"?
　Scrapbox project used to stock information among unexplored junior mentors since 2017
　　I use a combination of chat-like tools. I have used Slack and MS Teams in the past and now Mattermost.
　　I think the style of using chat together is good, as it is used with Slack even within Nota, a group of people who are familiar with Scrapbox.
　Records of a wide variety of events, discussions among mentors, TIPS, etc. are accumulated here.
　　but not content that can be published as is.
　　I would like to share information in a well-cut out or abstracted way.

Reminder: these are not "common views of mentors".
　Some articles are based on the opinions of several mentors, but it's "what Nishio personally thinks based on them.
　If you try to get it out after a common view, the throughput will go down.

What we're going to do
　Link to previously published articles
　We also want to publish unpublished tips.
　　but it's way overcapacity.
　　To begin with, I'm busy with this year's judging and need to get the Scrapbox project for creatives in place at the end of May.

　[Implicit assumption that you are the assumed user].
　　It is not a perspective that accompanies the creator.

　2019-05-03 [Should we write adoption criteria?]
　2019-05-10
		I'm wondering what criteria should be adopted each year.
			It is not obvious whether the strength of the relationship with the core business should be evaluated positively or negatively
		I'm learning more and more each year as I accumulate more and more experiences.
			This year's policy
				Creator + PM" is a team
				If you are a team, you must have the vision of all team members.
				PM is not the team leader, but the chief creator is the team leader
				So, shouldn't a PM choose the team he belongs to based on "whether or not he can [sympathize] with the [vision] of the chief creator"?
				[Sympathy for the vision]

　　Now I think the term "adoption criteria" is inappropriate.
　　　Because we're not making decisions about acceptance or rejection based on verbalized rules.
　　　It's a statement of values, of "what kind of things tend to be viewed positively."

	[Asking parents for advice is not a cheat].
		However, he refuses to allow parents to be present during interviews.
		　In some cases, parents are off-screen.
		　　It's not like the creators are answering the mentor's questions to the parent's face...
		　　I would judge this kind of thing as not a spontaneous project.

[both experienced and verbalization needed].

The "could" is an interpretation.
　Since "could" is an interpretation, one should not make assumptions about the facts to which it refers.

Do not impose the mentor's familiar methods.

What to do if you are making a technically nonsensical choice
　The "technically nonsensical choice" is Mentor's interpretation, not fact.

Teach them how to fish instead of giving them fish.
