Audition as many applicants as possible
Many are not skilled in preparing applications → Auditions should be open to as many applicants as possible
>As in the past, the screening was conducted in two stages: document review and audition. The audition screening was a presentation plus interview-style evaluation in which the proposer was asked to make a presentation of the proposal using slides, followed by a question-and-answer session based on the presentation. Applicants were young, under the age of 25, and some of them were middle and high school students. Therefore, many of them are not skilled in preparing application documents. If the screening process is based solely on the application documents, the skillful preparation of the documents will greatly affect the acceptance or rejection of the applicants. Since this would not serve the purpose of the project, we place great importance on auditions during the screening process. Since there is a limit to the amount of time available for auditions, the first stage of selection based on documents is unavoidable, but auditions are held for as many applicants as possible. This year, 35 auditions were conducted over two days, from morning to evening/evening, although not to the full extent of the time limit.
