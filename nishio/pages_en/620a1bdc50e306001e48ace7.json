体験は高次元空間上の曲線
[Experience] is [a curve in high-dimensional space], and no two points on the curve are identical because [time axis] is included as one of the axes.
Humans observe this by projecting it in the appropriate direction. In this way, "dark" and "light" areas are created.
Even if they have the same experience.
 (Although it can't be strictly "the same" since people and time are different.)
 What is identical and what is distinct is different because [the direction of projection is different].
