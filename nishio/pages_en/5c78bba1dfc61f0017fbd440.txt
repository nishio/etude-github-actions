>The first stage of making small groups is at most a few sheets. And when it comes to the smaller ones, there are usually a number of sheets that inevitably do not connect to other pieces of paper and remain as a single sheet. Such a single sheet is called a "detached monkey" or "[lone wolf]" for convenience. These lone wolves have their own reasons for remaining alone, and we should never force them into any one group, ignoring their arguments. It is better to think of them as a single group.

I verbally called them [stray monkeys] sometimes.
