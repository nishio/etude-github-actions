Relationship between sigmoid and softmax
	[$ \sigma(s) = 1 / (1 + \exp(-s))]
	[$ m(x_i) = \exp(x_i) / \sum \exp(x_i) ]
	[$ \sigma(s) = \exp(s) / (\exp(s) + \exp(s)\exp(-s)) = \exp(s) / (\exp(s) + 1) = \exp(s) / (\exp(s) + \exp(0))]
In other words, the sigmoid is a two-factor softmax, which corresponds to the case where the output of the event of interest's extra-event is 0
