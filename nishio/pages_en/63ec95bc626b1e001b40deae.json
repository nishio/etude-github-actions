ChatGPT reminded me of a word I had forgotten.

[nishio.icon]What was the word pronounced like renaissance, meaning the process of the birth of a thing or the appearance of a thing at the time of its birth?
[GPT.icon]Perhaps it is "Renaissance" you are trying to remember...
It's not a [nishio.icon]renaissance, I think it probably started in Re
[GPT.icon]Yes, you probably remember the word "Reify"...
[nishio.icon]Not that one, it was longer and sounded more Latin.
[GPT.icon]Well, it might be easier to get an answer if you give us a little more information, but perhaps you recall the phrase "In statu nascendi".
	In statu nascendi" is Latin for "stage of emergence." The term is used to refer to the state of a work or idea at the time of its emergence, especially in the fields of art, literature, and science. In other words, the term is used to describe a state that is not yet complete, and therefore has not yet reached its full form.
	For example, evaluating the "In statu nascendi" status of a work of art allows us to focus on the process of completing the work and to find areas for improvement to further enhance its perfection. Also in the field of science, an "In statu nascendi" evaluation is sometimes described as an evaluation of the early stages of a hypothesis as it arises.

Sounds like it. I looked it up and found a reference to Freud using it.

	> Nascent; emerging but not yet fully formed.

[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nascent nascent - Wiktionary]
	> Etymology: Borrowed from Latin nascēns, nascēntis, present participle of nascor (“I am born”). Doublet of naissant.
 > Emerging; just coming into existence. 
Ahhh, I see. That's the etymology of the "nessance" part of "Renaissance."

And I thought the translation "[the state of affairs when it arose]" in the PDF above seemed more usable than "[In statu nascendi]" which would not be conveyed without explanation.
