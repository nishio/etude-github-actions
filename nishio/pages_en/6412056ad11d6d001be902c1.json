>A: If we don't set up a social security-type system for workers who are no longer needed right now, security will definitely be at its worst. I can see this far. It's time to rebuild the system, the concept of tax payment, for that purpose, but Japan and others don't seem to have any sense, so the worst time will come rather soon.
> 
> B: The larger the organization, the less likely they are to realize the need for countermeasures and take a back seat, so maybe the wealthy will move to a smaller gated city and hire their own security guards to improve security.
> 
> A: 荘園！
> 
> B: History seems to diverge depending on whether the wealthy then gobble up their assets, or whether they continue to grow their assets in that state. In the latter case, I wonder if they will be forced to grant autonomy to the state in exchange for providing funds to the state so that it can have a stronger police force...

>([GPT-4])>>> Supplement the following conversation with context so that high school students can understand it. Briefly explain gated cities and manors. Follow the history of the establishment of city-states in medieval Europe.

>A: If social security is not provided for those who will no longer need labor, public safety will worsen. A new tax system or mechanism is needed to address this problem, but since Japan has been slow in dealing with this issue, tough times will come.
> 
> B: Larger organizations are often slow to address problems. Therefore, wealthy people might move to [gated cities], closed communities, and hire their own security guards to improve security. A gated city is a residential neighborhood surrounded by high security.
> 
> A: That sounds a lot like the [manorial] system in medieval Europe. The manorial system was the economic and social foundation of medieval Europe, in which lords governed the land and peasants they controlled.
> 
> B: Depending on the subsequent course of history, the development will depend on whether the wealthy run out of assets or increase their assets. If they increase their assets, they may strengthen their police force by funding the state to grant them autonomy. This is similar to the formation of [city-states] in medieval Europe. City-states are cities with independent political and economic authority, and were established in medieval Europe with the development of commerce.

nishio: hmmm, "manor!" is the image of Japan, isn't it?
0xtkgshn: I guess so!
nishio:I took it out to see if the "city-state" was affecting it, but it still seems to think it's European by default. I guess Europe is bigger than Japan...

>A, you mention manor, which is a medieval Japanese system of local rule in which the wealthy had their own fiefdoms and ruled over the people in those fiefdoms.

>A gated city is a city where upscale residential and commercial areas are surrounded by gates that prevent people from leaving the gates. They are created by people seeking a high level of security and safety to avoid danger and chaos from the outside by creating their own world inside the gates.
> 
> Regarding the establishment of city-states in medieval Europe, after the fall of the Roman Empire, people began to gather in walled cities to escape the threat of the Eastern Roman Empire and Islamic powers. They were able to self-manage their cities' defense and trade, and some of them even gained autonomy. This was the prototype of the city-state in medieval Europe.
> 
> Medieval European city-states also prospered economically. Especially in Italy, commercial activity developed and merchants came to dominate the city-states. These city-states developed institutions such as the guild system, citizenship, and contract law to support commercial activities.
> 
> The above shows that factors such as security and economic development overlap in the establishment of gated cities and the city-state in medieval Europe.
