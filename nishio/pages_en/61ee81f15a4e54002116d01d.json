The bug that divides society into two halves
When we are talking about human behavior X and Y, some people interpret it as talking about a set of humans [bifurcating society].

For example, when we are talking about "sit-ups X and backbends Y are two different muscle-building exercises," some people will say, "Some people do both X and Y."

Refutes a claim that doesn't exist, even though it doesn't claim that "there are people who only do X."[straw man argument analogy].

Is it more appropriate to call it [a bug that confuses behavior and people]?
