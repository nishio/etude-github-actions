Scrapbox Export Tool
 Facebook is a very good fit to do [the write out method] (one person brainstorming).
 However, it sometimes crashes, is heavy with extra functions, and above all, posting to Scrapbox is a pain because of the extra UI!
  I'm comfortable doing the export method to Facebook on my phone, but I'm not comfortable viewing that on my PC because of all the ads and other extraneous stuff on the side.
  Copying and pasting from Facebook to [Scrapbox] is also rather cumbersome (due to the extra stuff in the UI), so it would be good to have an export method tool that includes this as well.
 There should be a dedicated export application.
 A page is automatically created in the pre-defined Scrapbox project with the start date and time as the title.
  Change the title or indent it later.
 When you do the write out method, you don't think about layout and stuff, you focus on dumping thoughts, so you don't need decorations and other features.
