	I want a solution to the problem that when you come up with improvements to a project that has been in development for a while, you can't decide what to do next, so the project is left unprogressed, and it accumulates and becomes uncollectible.
  Improvement ideas are not yet concrete actions
  We need to generate action by doing the [chewing task] first.
  ã€€What exactly is a "chew task?" was asked in [conversation log 2020-06-08].
		Clarity of project objectives will promote project growth.
  The goal is to help you choose an action
		Spontaneous projects stop turning when [cycle friction] increases
		Projects that are only in one person are particularly serious
  A project is less likely to stop if it is placed between several people.

[nishio.icon]Let's talk.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I would like a solution to the problem that when I come up with improvements to a project that has been in development for a while, the next action is not decided upon, and the project is left unprogressed, and it accumulates and becomes uncollectible.
[nisbot.icon]What type of action is that action?
Actions to improve [nishio.icon] projects
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that action?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, if we don't do it, we won't move forward.
[nisbot.icon] Actions to improve the project
How will you know about this action?
[nishio.icon]Yeah, that's right. Let's see, when I come up with an idea to improve a project, that idea hasn't yet been chewed down to [specific action]. So you put it on your TODO list, but it doesn't get executed. You need to do the "[chew task]" first to chew up the idea and get an actionable action.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that action?
[nishio.icon](I would like to ask "what is that bite" here, but there is a problem that verbs are hard to be extracted as keywords, I found another new improvement.)
Action appears after the bite, not yet
[nisbot.icon]Where is that action?
[nishio.icon]No
[nisbot.icon]
>Yes, that's right. Let's see, when I come up with an idea to improve a project, that idea hasn't been chewed down to a concrete action yet. So you put it on your TODO list, but it doesn't get executed. You need to do the "chew task" first to chew up the idea and get actionable actions.
What type of project is this?
[nishio.icon]A [spontaneous project] where what needs to be done is not given to you from the outside. It is also up to you to decide how to improve it.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that project?
[nishio.icon]Spontaneous projects stop turning when the [cycle friction] gets too big.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that project located?
[nishio.icon]If it's between multiple people, then other people's activities may trigger it, but if it's a one-person project, if that one person stops working, that alone will bring the project to a halt. This is especially serious for projects that are only in one person's hands.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know about the project?
[nishio.icon]Knowing, or rather, coming up with, the state of doing.
Maybe most specific if it's "know the what's of the project." The purpose of the project, the value of doing the project, how the project will develop...
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, so you're in a situation where you feel that the current project has so-so value, and you think that the improvements you've come up with will make it even more valuable, but for some reason that improvement activity is not taking place.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that project and the action?
[nishio.icon]Actions make the project better.
[nisbot.icon]Is the action the same as the project? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]The accumulation of actions shapes the project.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that project?
[nishio.icon]At first it's only in one person, in the future it's better to have it between several people.
[nisbot.icon]The accumulation of actions shapes the project.
Where is this project coming from?
[nishio.icon]A project is created when one person first comes up with an idea, then "bites the bullet" with the motivation to confirm the idea, creates an action, and then implements the action.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the project when that action is taken?
[nishio.icon]Growing up
What happens to actions when [nisbot.icon] projects?
When [nishio.icon] project objectives are clearly verbalized, it is easier to choose the right action to take from a variety of possible actions.
[nisbot.icon]What is between that action and the project?
[nishio.icon]There is not a one-way arrow from the action to the project, but a two-way arrow that interacts
[nisbot.icon]What does that project look like?
[nishio.icon]Well, I don't know. Maybe [Polaris].
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that North Star and the project?
[nishio.icon]The North Star helps determine the direction in which to go. If the purpose of a project is clearly defined in language, it will be easier to determine the direction in which to proceed.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between the project and its objectives?
[nishio.icon]Summary so far
Clarity of project objectives will promote project growth.
The goal is to help you choose an action
A project is less likely to stop if it is placed between several people.
Improvement ideas are not actions, we need to create actions by biting the bullet and doing the task first.
[nisbot.icon]Is the project the same as the objective? Are they different?
[nishio.icon]The objective is the North Star, and the project is the marching process that's going on.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the objective when that project?
[nishio.icon]Sometimes the purpose of a project changes while you're working on it.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the project when its objective?
[nishio.icon]Some of the things we have been doing will become unnecessary, and conversely, various things that we have not been doing will become necessary.
[nisbot.icon]What is the connection between the project and its objectives?
[nishio.icon]This is also a two-way arrow
Is the [nisbot.icon] project the same as the North Star? Are they different?
[nishio.icon]Wrong.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the North Star when the project is done?
[nishio.icon]Bye-bye!
