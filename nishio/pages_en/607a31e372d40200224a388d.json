Mackie's Theory of Error
The moral code is a product of people's way of life and their endorsement of it, and it is an error to think that the moral nature is on the side of the world.

Blackburn's defense
> What makes us feel "objective" about moral values is that as we are taught and internalize the rightness and wrongness of actions in a particular lifestyle, we develop negative feelings about actions that are considered "wrong" in that environment. These feelings make them feel as if moral values exist in any objective way.

In primitive times, people moved according to their own needs, and when living with several people, there were times when it was inconvenient for each individual to move according to his or her own needs (such as eating food without permission), and at first, people were ruled with a background of power (such as being beaten by father if one pinched him or her).
At this point, it was merely an action based on one person's desire to control certain behaviors of others, but those who lived in that environment and endorsed it misinterpreted it as an objective moral code.
The objective fact is that "my father would get angry and hit me if I snacked on it." but it turns into "snacking is evil."

I have been thinking that "[a chain of power harassment]" in a company where power harassment is prevalent, where a mid-level employee who has been power harassed in the past power harasses a new employee, is not a good thing, but that is only because the ethics endorsed in their lifestyle and the ethics endorsed in my lifestyle are different, and that is how it appears to me, and what is happening within that company is the same as the process of establishing ethics. What is happening in the company is the same as the process of establishing ethics.
