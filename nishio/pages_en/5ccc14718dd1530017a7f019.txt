2019 Unexplored Junior
2019[unexplored junior] notes on what I thought

	[Should we be sympathetic?]
	Lack of "ought power."
		There are a number of cases where something that can be easily found by searching for it, but is not found because of the assumption that "I must be the only one who can come up with such a thing.
		Trapped in the belief that "it shouldn't be there."
		It's a healthy flow of "it must be there," "I can't find it," and "what the heck, I'll make it.
	[Do not use the fact that an idea looks novel as a reason for adopting it.]
	About Feedback
		I like to say interesting things are interesting.
			For interesting projects, we want to provide feedback so that rejection is not interpreted to mean "this project is not good enough, so stop!
   I guess "interesting" is better than no message at all.
   We have a limited number of slots, so we have no choice, but I think this project is interesting! I want to tell you that
   Always have PM Goto in mind.

		We want to encourage next actions as much as possible. Feedback that says, "I think it would have been better if this was included in the proposal," while it is true that the words of the feedback indicate the direction of improvement, it does not lead to next action because the target of improvement is the "application.

 	[You shouldn't say, "That's hard."]
	[Asking parents for advice is not a cheat].

[Possible lucky break].
[Projects with strong competition]
