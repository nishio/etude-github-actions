Steve Jobs: Good artists copy, great artists steal

[Steve Jobs]: [Good artists copy, great artists steal]
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6jeZ7m0ycw]

[Steve Jobs] says [Pablo Picasso] made this statement, but no evidence has been found.
[Good Artists Copy; Great Artists Steal â€“ Quote Investigator https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/]

You can say what [Steve Jobs] wanted to say in this sentence from [T.S. Elliot] without attributing it to [Picasso].
>One of the surest of tests is the way in which a poet borrows. Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion. A good poet will usually borrow from authors remote in time, or alien in language, or diverse in interest.
	(DeepL) One sure sign of this is the way poets borrow. Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal. Bad poets deface what they steal; good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds what he steals into an emotional whole that is unique and quite different from what was torn apart; the bad poet throws it into something that has no cohesion. Good poets usually borrow from writers who are temporally distant, linguistically heterogeneous, or diverse in their interests.
The "good poets make it into something better, or at least something different" part would be [Think Different].
