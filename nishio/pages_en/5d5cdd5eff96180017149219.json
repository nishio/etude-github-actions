深圳大学留学
	春学期
		For 2019
 		Online application: ~January 5
   Arrival in Shenzhen: approx. 2/27
   Classes and exams: 3/4 - 7/5
  180,000 for tuition, 50,000/m for rent, 30,000/m for food, 500,000 at least.
  	You may be able to work remotely, but it's a waste of time to do work that can be done in Japan in front of a PC when you're all the way in China.
  	Assume zero operating hours for the first month and think about how you can provide value to the company after you become familiar with the area.
