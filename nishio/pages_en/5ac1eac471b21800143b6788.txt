The Five Ps
From [DIPS, Intellectual Productivity Improvement System].
Not so good naming, but a way of thinking about [prioritizing] tasks. What should be prioritized? From the top to the bottom.
	Copy that.
 	I don't care how you change it, as long as the other party agrees.
  If you can't get it, you can't change it, and if you break this, you lose credibility.
 saving
 	If doing something by a certain deadline saves time overall, the priority of that task is temporarily increased
  This is also the way to reduce overhead by bundling tasks
 time
 	Deadlines already given, meeting schedules, etc.
 embedded (e.g. software)
 	After schedule times are finalized, there can be gaps in between.
  Put tasks that can be done in a pre-stocked half-hour at the half-hour.
  In other words, we can say that "the priority of half tasks has temporarily increased".
 value
 	Selecting Tasks by Certainty of Value
 	If you're not sure which to execute first, choose the one with the clearest value.
  	[nishio.icon]Is that right? This has the feel of someone "doing a given job."

It is impossible to say that they are listed alphabetically as Ryokai, Setsuyaku, Time, Umekomi, and Value.
