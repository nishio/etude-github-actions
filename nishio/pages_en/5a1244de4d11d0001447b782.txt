Can" and "can't."
	Can" and "cannot" are interpretations, not facts.
 	The claim "I can't" implies "I can't think of a way to make it happen."
   Even if it's an expert opinion, there are cases where the person simply can't think of a way to do it.
   It has been repeatedly observed that there are cases where other experts say that it can be done
  The claim "it can be done" is also an interpretation, meaning "I have an idea how to make it happen."
   You don't know if you can actually do it until you do it and get the observed fact that you "did it".
 Comparison
  It is very unlikely that someone who thinks "I can't" will ever reach "I could."
  The probability that a person who thinks he or she "could" reach "could" depends on the person's ability to estimate.
  Those who think they "can do it" experience the fact that they tried and "couldn't do it," and can improve their estimating ability and planning.
  Those who think "I can't" don't get the opportunity to learn because they don't try.
  Anything without significant risk should be knocked down to the "can do" side.
