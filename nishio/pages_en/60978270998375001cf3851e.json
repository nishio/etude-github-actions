mechanism design
>Mechanism design is a branch of economics. [It aims to design rules (also called "mechanisms" or "game forms") that allow for the autonomous/decentralized realization of goals in areas such as resource allocation and public decision making, given a goal to be realized in the form of a function. [Wikipedia https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/メカニズムデザイン]

Sounds interesting. I had it confused with [game mechanics].
　I knew about [second-price auctions], but it seems to be an area that studies this kind of stuff.

　[Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem]
　 >The only social choice rule that does not exclude a particular candidate and satisfies [strategy resistance] when society's preferences are determined by voting among three or more candidates is the [dictatorship] system.
