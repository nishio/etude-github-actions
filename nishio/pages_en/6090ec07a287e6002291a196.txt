 *1310052006*Task Management
 I am severely lacking in continuity, but that is how I was able to continue studying English vocabulary for a month. I am happy for you.
 
 What we found out:.
 - Don't set big goals at the beginning
 - Start small, as if you can do this much.
 - Make it an initial goal to measure how much you can do.
 - The goal is to improve the problems identified by the measurements to the extent that it can be done comfortably.
 - If you accidentally set a hard goal, change it quickly.
 
 We tend to resist changing our goals, but when we say "don't change your goal," the "goal" is the goal. For example, "walk to the top of the mountain. The detailed goals we are talking about here are different from the goal. They are milestones toward reaching the goal. Suppose you want to climb a mountain, so you set a milestone: "I will walk another 15 minutes on this road. Then you find out that the path has been destroyed by a landslide and that it will be more difficult than expected to follow the path you had planned. To reach the goal, of course you have to turn back. If you stick to the milestone and go recklessly and fail to reach the goal, it will be meaningless.
 
 In my case, my goal is "to be able to speak English well enough to chat with foreigners I meet for the first time in English while having drinks at HUB," and for that purpose, I thought about doing a Skype conversation practice program, but even if I signed a one-month contract, I would not be able to study consistently everyday. So I decided to make it a milestone to study English consistently first. As those of you who have been watching me since the beginning have probably figured out, I didn't pursue the amount of English words I could memorize or the level of English vocabulary, but just focused on making it a habit.
 
 Next, I want to do something about the fact that my tasks have recently become parallel and I'm not good at task switches, so they're taking a lot of my overhead with them. I can't get caught up with other things, such as not being able to start making lecture materials even though it won't be confirmed until tomorrow whether or not I'll be teaching at sepcamp, being too anxious to do anything else even though I was told not to, polling the #spcamp tag on Twitter at a high frequency, etc. and you can't do parallel processing with a lot of waiting time unless you do something about it.
 
 I bought the book you recommended, anyway. I think I have it at home, but I can't find it:)

 - Record daily meals in a notebook to develop the habit of looking at the notebook.
 - sticky note on one's desk
 - Change colors depending on whether the ball is in your or someone else's hands.
 - It's important to do what needs to be done, and to let out what needs to be done but can't be done because of waiting or higher-priority tasks, so that you can forget about it.
 - Task management is different for everyone, so it's important to know what your struggles are
 
 For now, I think I'll start by recording my meals in my notebook. Right now, I don't even check my notebook three times a day. It would be good for my diet.
