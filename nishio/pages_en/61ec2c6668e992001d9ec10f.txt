Japanese and English projects in one project
　[Scrapbox in multiple languages].
　[/villagepump/multiple projects transparently].
　I've been racking my brains about how to handle my Japanese and English projects transparently, and I'm starting to think that maybe I should make them one project in the first place.
　　Why split the project?
　　For those who can only read English, the top page of my Japanese project looks like a pile of garbage.
　　As a result, interrelated projects were fragmented
　　I began to think, "We need a mechanism to discover the connections between projects."

　　Essentially, what was needed was a "narrower view of content for English speakers only".
　　　Scrapbox couldn't do that because it doesn't allow you to select a view for a narrowed-down list of items.
　　　Maybe [Scrapbox Reader] can do it?
　　　 If you [attribute expression in iconic notation] and flag it for English speakers
　　　　Write a specific icon notation on every page... that's a pain in the ass...
　　　　If you write automatically, it won't be that much trouble[/villagepump/takker.icon].
　When doubts arise about the fundamental reason for the existence of something that is being developed, what should we do w
	now that the policy is settled
	 [I hope we can come to a policy on how to proceed with the ScrapboxAutoTrans project moving forward.]
		Machine translation is pending.
  Merging two projects on Scrapbox
  　Flag the English version of a project as English using the iconic notation.
  Create a view in ScrapboxReader that shows only English-flagged items for English speakers.
　Merged.
　It would be nice to be able to randomly display only articles with a specific icon on them.
　　One of the downsides of merging projects
