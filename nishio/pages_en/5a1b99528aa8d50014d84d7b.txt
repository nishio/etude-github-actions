There must be power.
Aruhasuda-ryoku means "the power to think that something should be there.
There has to be. If you lack the power, you don't look for and don't find what [you can find if you look for it].

	When you look for something you think "should be there," you may or may not find it.
 If you don't think, "It must be there," you don't look for it, so of course you can't find it.

Example
	It is hard to believe that other people have not encountered such a problem in a widely used programming language that I, as a layman, have encountered. Someone out there must have encountered the same problem, solved it, and published it on the Internet, so let's look for it.
