 Thoughts.
  Answer the number of adjacent value matches each time by adding to one of the following: odd, even, or one point.
  Since the query is 10^5, per query is a constant or log
  One point change is okay, but odd numbers are a problem.
  　If you have an even-numbered minus an odd-numbered difference, it is just a Range Add.
  　Range Add to find the number of 0's in the whole?
 　　Don't Range Add, just look for the -x ones.
 　　　Constant order if you can have the frequency table in an array.
 　　　10^9, so it's impossible.
 　　　Can we use hash?
 　　What do you do when you renew a point?
 　　　calculate backwards
