Parable of the Rivers
The "river's flow" exists continuously, but its waters are not the same.
When you look at water, it comes and goes. It is not continuous in itself. The continuous flow of the river exists through the constant repetition of the "coming and going" of countless individual bodies of water.

 [You can't step into the same river twice].

[Houjouki]
>The river flows constantly, and yet it is not the water it was before.

　[Civilization] is a river
　　Individual humans have limited lives, but the movement of civilization created by countless humans is continuous
