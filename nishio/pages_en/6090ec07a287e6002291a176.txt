 *1304480739*(Spoiler) about the last episode of Madoka Magica
 One question about the last story. Madoka's wish is "I want to wipe out all witches before they are born. All witches in the universe, past and future, with my own hands." But she didn't. I think the reason why she put "all the universes" in the wish is to emphasize that it includes all the parallel universes, but if that is the case, if Homura invokes "I want to redo my encounter with Madoka" again, the universes will diverge again on the morning of Homura's discharge, and that universe will also be a "world without witches. I don't know. And wouldn't she be able to meet Madoka again and be happily ever after?
 
 When I was watching the last episode, I wondered if Madoka's wish would not only cause the universe to diverge at the "point where witches occur" in all of space-time, but as a side effect, it would also cause a divergence where "Madoka is born" would not occur. Yes, I think QB did warn about this. So Homura's wish to "redo the encounter" is no longer feasible since Madoka no longer exists in all of space-time? Hmmm.
 
 *1304502954*"Division of Labor and Competition - Outsourcing Management of Competitive Advantage" Leverage Memo
 "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4641161763/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative =7399&creativeASIN=4641161763">Division of Labor and Competition - Outsourcing Management for Competitive Advantage</a>". Also read "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4382055431/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=4382055431">OPEN INNOVATION - All About Harvard Style Innovation Strategy</a>" so this leverage memo is a mixture of those two books.
 
 Knowledge is difficult to enclose. Since it is stored in the mind of an employed individual, it can easily leak out of the company when that person changes jobs. In such an era, "in-house developed" is not always the best. There are cases in which using a product made by another company is superior in terms of performance and cost-effectiveness. In some cases, it is cheaper to outsource to other companies that specialize in mass production rather than to manufacture everything in-house. Therefore, outsourcing is important in such areas. However, outsourcing this part of the business means that competitors can also outsource the same part of the business, which means that there is no differentiation. Outsourcing is necessary, but it is the opposite of differentiation, and it causes a loss of competitive advantage. This is the dilemma of outsourcing. What should we do?
 
 The "division of labor over knowledge." Who has which knowledge and how much? How is knowledge created and managed? To what extent should we have knowledge?
 
 In considering the effective use of external results, we should not focus exclusively on the outside. Internal capabilities require management of knowledge from a broad, long-term, and comprehensive perspective, especially for novel innovations.
 
 In Porter's theory of competitive strategy in the U.S. in the late 19th century, parts suppliers and others through the market were bargaining partners and enemies. On the other hand, the Japanese automobile industry built personal relationships and long-term cooperative relationships with subcontractor parts factories. The percentage of American companies was 81%. Japan's 4-5 month advantage in development lead time is due to the division of labor (Clark and Fujimoto 1991).
 
 For automakers, component knowledge is similar to Cohen and Levinthal's (1990) "absorptive capacity. This refers to the ability to accurately and quickly understand new technologies as they emerge and use them for commercialization. By conducting basic research on their own, companies can increase their absorptive capacity, even though they will not profit from it in the short term or directly. This capacity plays an important role when major changes occur.
 
 I haven't chewed it up too much yet, so I'll make another leverage memo when I understand it better.
