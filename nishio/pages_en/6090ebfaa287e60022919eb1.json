 *1221667941*Which is easier, Python or Haskell?
 http://q.hatena.ne.jp/1221581192
 
 Awww, not even close.
 
 I wonder if there are a lot of people who, with two choices and an open process, will say, "I don't know, but it's close, so I'll vote to keep it close. Or am I just mistaken and Haskell is actually as easy as Python in general?
 
 So I asked the question.

 Well, first place goes to Python and second to Scheme, in that order. I want to ask them for an hour if they knew what Coq was and voted for it. Well, most of them probably didn't know what Coq was, so they chose the top one and voted for it. It is very sad that there are so many people who are willing to inconvenience others for the sake of just one point. Well, to be honest, I don't care how many votes there are, because the purpose of the choice is to reduce "noise caused by people who choose at random" by about 8 cases except Python, Scheme, and Haskell. As you can imagine, the results were Python > Scheme > Haskell, so with this result, I asked "Which is more difficult, Python or Haskell?" I'll use this result as the answer to id:snow-bell's question "Which is harder, Python or Haskell?

 This is why Python is in first place!
 Python because of Mr. Nishio?
 Personally, I thought Scheme was better than Python!!!! I thought.
 As for Q2, I agree! I was.
 In the end, if you're talking about Haskell and Python, Haskell is subtly more difficult and its harder.
 What a contradiction to say that Python is the best way to teach beginners...
 I have learned that surveys are unreliable.

 Eh.
 - Python, the successor to ABC, developed as an educational language for beginners
 - Scheme, which is often used in education because of its simple syntax, was created by organizing the venerable Lisp specification.
 - Haskell is a pure functional language, but with monads you can do procedural-like things! Haskell
 Normally, I would think that the order would be in this order for beginners.

 I don't understand the original intent of the question, and if you're thinking "Personally, I'd rather study Scheme than Python! If you're thinking "w", why don't you start studying Scheme from the beginning?
 <<
 
 The short explanation is that they said "Python is a much more difficult language than Haskell" and I wanted to say that's not true, but my saying "that's not true" is subjective, so I told them they should ask me in a survey.
 
 *1221668575* The Cursed Day
 Just when I thought my cold was gone, the air conditioning and secondhand smoke at the restaurant where I had a meeting made my throat slit again.
 
 I tried to eat some yogurt thinking it would be good for my throat, but my hand went crazy and I spilled it on the chair.
 
 While washing in the bathroom, water ran down the chair and overflowed into the hallway, flooding the laptop computer that was placed there, but we noticed and stopped the flooding before it happened!
 
 In terms of spells, if three succeed, something terrible will happen, but since I prevented it with the third one, it is assumed that the shikigami has returned to the person who put the curse on me and is now striking back.
