Abstraction is not a one way street.

There are countless ways to [abstract] concrete information. It varies from person to person.

It is futile to start a discussion based on [incorrect abstraction], but somehow it happens, why?
抽象化は情報の削減。
When concrete information does not fit into an individual's cognitive capacity, he or she unconsciously discards the information and abstracts it.
The more unfamiliar a field is, the higher the probability of making "incorrect abstractions," so we should think more concretely, but the more unfamiliar a field is, the higher the cognitive load, so we unconsciously abstract from it.

People who are proficient in a certain field share a common "method of abstraction commonly used in that field.
So [common abstraction] allows us to reduce information and communicate efficiently.
The basic premise of "efficient information transfer through abstraction" is that "it is a common abstraction method."
