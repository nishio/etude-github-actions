	There are people who disagree with some person x or some opinion x
	Unconsciously equate the opinions of "the people."
		Misinterpret "people" as if they were one person.
			[Bug that sees multiple people as one person].
		I know it in my head. Do you think you are one person?" I say no if you ask me.
		But the behavior is against a hypothetical "one person".
		[overgeneralize] some of "the people."
	The assertion that "those who disagree are xx" is "[the subject matter is large]."
