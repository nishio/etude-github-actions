Werewolf Victory Condition Ancho
	Victory condition: The human side wins if one or more werewolves are among the hanged.
		If more than one werewolf is among the hanged" = for example, if only one of the two werewolves is hanged, the human side wins.
	The person who receives the most votes by ballot is hanged.
		If the most votes are split (e.g. 2, 2), more than one person is hung.
		In some cases, the four votes are split into 1, 1, 1, 1, and they all get hung.
	Basically, the game is played by dividing the game into human and werewolf sides, and the werewolf side wins by defeating the human side.
		The exception is when there are two werewolf cards in the center pile and all players are on the human side.
		Only in this case is it a cooperative game, and everyone wins only if everyone points to the mountain and not to others.
