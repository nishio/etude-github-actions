(1.2.1.4) Counterwind
When compared to students, full-time workers experience strong wind blowing against the learning. To use limited time and money for learning without losing the counterwind, you need strong motivation. It is the driving force of the learning cycle. It is like an engine in a boat.

I am not going to order "[motivate] yourself." The words are useless.  We can not motivate someone by ordering to motivate themselves. My argument is the opposite.

Let's say that you are an adult and now thinking that you'd better learn, though it is better to learn. 

Let's suppose that you are a full-time worker and have something you think you should learn. For example, "It would be better to study Chinese." It is impossible to learn it if you do not have strong motivation. The weak engine can not drive the boat against the strong counterwind. You better give up learning it and switch your mind to something you are motivated. 

Motivation is a valuable resource, so it is necessary to observe yourself well and know what motivates you. To say "I should do it, but I do not feel motivated" is a waste of time. For active learning, it is yourself to find motivating themes and decide what to learn.

If you find something interesting, and you get motivated, you want to keep pouring fuel so that the engine of motivation does not stop. Next, let's think about how we can keep motivated.
