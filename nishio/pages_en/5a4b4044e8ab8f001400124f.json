Incentives to belong to the community
	To maintain a community without work orders or other binding force, there must be [incentives] to belong to that [community].
 [It is good to see communities that fail to create incentives go under.]
 	Companies have [the ability to go bankrupt], and Drucker found that to be an excellent point
  Likewise, the community has an inherent function that if it cannot supply incentives to participants, it will go under, which is a wonderful thing.
  We should make more and more and destroy more and more.
 By creating barriers to participation, you can create an incentive to get something that is only available there.
  Or, "an opportunity to see things you wouldn't normally get to see." [Prisoner's Dilemma#5a4c9c13aff09e00009f5ed6 of Information Exchange].
