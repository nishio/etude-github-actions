sour grapes
[Aesop's Fables]
The story of the fox who wanted to take the grapes but couldn't and said, "They must be sour grapes" [sore loser].

I consider [what I didn't get] to be [worthless].

It's the opposite of "the fish you miss is bigger." You perceive what you don't get as smaller.

　There is a way to tell the difference between sour grapes and sweet grapes, but if you don't know how to do it

　　Like [making dried persimmons from astringent persimmons].
			>The sugar content of sweet persimmons (not astringent persimmons) is around 16 degrees, but [astringent persimmons] have a sugar content of around 20 degrees. When this astringent persimmon is dried, the astringency and water are removed, and the sugar content reaches 50 degrees.

   Everyone is happily picking persimmons, so I picked some myself, ate them straight away and said, "Astringent!" I picked a persimmon myself and ate it as it was.
