Sanyuttha Nikaya.
No. 3 of 5 parts of the Pali sutras
In Japan, it is often written as [相応部], but in this Scrapbox, since it is the name of a Pali scripture, I decided to write it in Pali.
>The Saṃyutta Nikāya (SN) is the third "division" (nikāya) of the "five divisions" (Ba: Pañca Nikāya, Pancha Nikāya) that make up the Buddhist Pali scripture collection. It is a collection of short sutras on different themes. The term saṃyutta (saṃyutta) refers to "thematic groupings.
