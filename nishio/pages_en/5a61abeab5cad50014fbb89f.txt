How to get to Prosin
 SVO and the Dancing Girl are different.
  There are no unreserved seats in SVO departing from Shinjuku.
   It's difficult to buy a reserved seat ticket after entering the premises.
   At the Midori-no-madoguchi counter, say it's to Ito, buy it, and then go in.
  	The Super View Odoriko (SVO) does not run very often.
    925 is last today.
  The regular Odoriko train also has unreserved seats.
  	But this time he couldn't sit down.
  	The Kodama from Tokyo Station was smooth.
    But when you get to Atami and want to change trains, the Ito line doesn't come for 25 minutes.
