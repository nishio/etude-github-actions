I've been thinking about making a Japanese Scrapbox into an English translated Scrapbox, or a dynamic Scrapbox into a static Scrapbox, or making part of a private project public, etc., but I'm not sure what to do.

New idea
　1: Static HTML
　　I was worried about "what if I want to modify the English side after the conversion" with automatic translation from Japanese to English, etc. After the conversion, it shall be static HTML, and no human modification shall be made.
　2: Insert automatic Japanese-English translation
　　At this time, "I translated the title and it clashed with the existing page" can happen.
　　So automatic generation of navigation pages is necessary.
　　You never know how you'll see the results of a machine translation and how you'll want to modify it until you try it.
　　By setting "do not edit after conversion," the system will "then copy and paste the English page into Scrapbox and modify it" and "adopt the manual translation instead of the machine translation at the next conversion.
　　Need a microformat to convey this instruction to the conversion engine
　3: Merging from multiple projects
　　If we can "navigate in case of bumps when translating," we should be able to "navigate when merging from multiple projects."
　　You can also "publish a public tag page of a private project" here

to the discussion so far.

　Use [/villagepump/scrapbox as database for static hosting].
