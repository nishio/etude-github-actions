　Thoughts.
　　When the areas to be inverted overlap, it is safe to assume that they do not overlap, since there are non-overlapping inversion methods that yield the same result [one may assume that the intervals do not intersect].
　　　[Composition of interval inversion is XOR].
　　Therefore, we can turn over the K chunks of 0's to make the longest chunk of 1's
　　To eliminate conditional branching, which considers a block of 1's of length 0 or greater at the beginning and end.
　　Just find the point where the distance between the starting point of the i-th lump of 1 and the end point of the i+k-th lump of 1 is the greatest
　　Enumerate start and end points in linear time and find the maximum in linear time
　Official Explanation OK
