People who want to solve problems and people who want to test hypotheses
People [who want to solve a problem] will do whatever seems to lead to a solution. When they solve it, they are satisfied. Until it is solved, they are unsatisfied.

[People who want to test a hypothesis] will want to test the hypothesis that "this idea will solve the problem" when they come up with an idea that might solve the problem.
The goal is to test the hypothesis, so whether it works or not, we are satisfied when we see the results.

　It may have something to do with [instantaneous and sustained action].
　[Problem finding]
　[Pasteur's Quadrant] is exactly this story.
