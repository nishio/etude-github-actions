　Thoughts.
　　competitive game
　　I'm not sure about the weighting between consideration and implementation, but let's consider it.
　　　When there is only one mountain, you win if you get them all.
　　　when two mountains are rising
　　　　If it's 1,1, you lose.
　　　　If x,x, no matter how you take it, it will return to the x,x form, so you lose.
　　　　If not, then you win in the form of x,x
　　　when there are three mountains
　　　　If a,b,b, you win by taking all a's.
　　　　　So is a,a,a.
　　　　a,b,cの時
　　　　　If you get some number somewhere for taking it, you lose.
　　　　　Three numbers in a row, you lose.
　　　　　If all but c are contiguous, move c to be contiguous and win.
　　　　　If there is a gap before b, count 2. If the total number of gaps is odd, win?
　　　　　　No, we can jump the order and attack to fill in the gaps.
　公式解説
　　I'm assuming "if the XOR of each number is 0, the latter wins" is known about Nim.
