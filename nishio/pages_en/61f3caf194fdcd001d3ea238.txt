The higher the lucky mountain, the greater the risk of slipping and falling.
The higher the [lucky] mountain, the greater the risk of slipping. [The duration of good luck is short.] Retreating [while lucky] is as good as advancing bravely.

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Leaving luck behind while winning.
xxxviii 

All the best players do. A great retreat is as good as a brave attack. When there are enough of them, or even many of them, they conceal their exploits. Long-lasting luck was doubtful. It seemed safer to be interrupted, and a little infusion of bitter-sweet made it seem even sweeter. The higher the mountain of luck, the greater the risk of slipping and all is spoiled. Fortune sometimes pays for the intensity of its benefits with the shortness of its duration. She soon tires of carrying someone on her shoulders for too long.
