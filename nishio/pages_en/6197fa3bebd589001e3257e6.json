Nested Concepts
The title is too abstract for what I'm writing, so I'll change it when I come up with a better title.

It is associated with several concepts
　[Two nested concepts in what we thought was one concept].
　[both "is X" and "is not X" are compatible].
　[Liskov Substitution Principle].

There are additional stories not mentioned in those.
　When person 1, who is thinking of X in the narrow sense, is speaking on the assumption that "the elements of X are A", person 2, who is thinking of X in the broad sense, thinks "1 is speaking on the assumption that 'the elements of X are A', which is wrong, let me tell you".
　　I think I'm trying to do the right thing, so [righteous violence] occurs.
　When person 2, who is thinking of X in the broad sense, asserts that there are elements of X that are not A, person 1, who is thinking of X in the narrow sense, thinks, "There is obviously no such thing, person 2 is wrong, let me tell you."
　　Or "because [cognitive resolution] is low."
　[both think the other is an idiot]


[series of drawings in which two people say different things]
　what is said is complex
　I've been trying to express myself without using natural language as much as possible, but when I do it this time
		[$ \forall x\in X, x\in A ] v.s. [$ \exists x\in X, x\notin A]
　be composed as follows
　Hmmm, well, but if you put it together with the diagram, can you figure it out even if you're not good at math? (Understand?)
