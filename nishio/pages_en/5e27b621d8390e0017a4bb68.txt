Uncaught Error: Network Error
[https://gyazo.com/e1b043d657fea88b8fb75f94f810873d]

	I get net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED in a no internet connection situation (I know this)
	I want to be able to use it offline so I don't die from errors.
	How do you handle errors?
		Neither firebase.initializeApp nor firebase.firestore is a Promise
		No firebase.initializeApp and firebase.firestore with try
	Error handling should be done on the React side.
		[Error Boundaries – React https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html]
 	>componentDidCatch and getDerivedStateFromError: There are no Hook equivalents for these methods yet, but they will be added soon.
  	[Hooks FAQ – React https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html]
			Can't do it in FC.
		I solved the problem by creating class ErrorBoundary.
		Now I'm simply console.logging with componentDidCatch.
			In the future, you can connect to [Sentry] or something like that.
