Performance Tuning
>As with Gear VR applications, there are a few basic settings that should be enforced for all Oculus Go applications:

 >Always render with Multi-View (what Unity calls “[Single-Pass Stereo]” rendering). In Unreal, ensure that you are using “Mobile Multi-View” and “Mobile Multi-View Direct.”
 >In Unity, using [OVRManager], disable [Enable Adaptive Resolution].
 >In Unity, ensure [Dynamic Batching] and [Static Batching] are both enabled in the Player Settings. [Graphics Jobs] should not be used.
