(0.1.1) What is Intellectual Production
Intellectual production is to create value using knowledge. It is easy to understand that writing and programming are intellectual productions. However, in other jobs, there are opportunities for intellectual production everywhere. 

Creating new knowledge by yourself is important for valuable intellectual production. Just using knowledge given by others doesn't create much value.

Let's think about programming. In most cases, by copying the [sample code] from the textbook, you can't achieve the purpose you want to achieve. To fulfill the your purpose, you need to [chew], [digest], and understand the sample code first. After that, you need to modify, combine, and create new programs according to your requirements and context. 

For other intellectual production, the structure is the same. It is necessary not only to copy the existing knowledge written in the book, but also to modify, combine, and create new methods.

[The optimal way to boost creativity depends on your situation, so you need to build it by yourself.]
