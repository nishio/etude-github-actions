review system
　They say auto-scrolling is better.
　I was trying to add a change in output destination.
　　but I realized that I would rather just rename the same-day folder at hand at the start of the review.
　I think it would be better to run both img2img and inpaint in the same process.
　　I was considering CONT signals, but I mean more than that.
　　If we start merging those, shouldn't the repository no longer be a fork of the original?
　　It's made from the original repository, but considering inpaint, should I make it diffuser based?
