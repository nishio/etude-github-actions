pseudosquare triangle
An isosceles triangle with base 8 and height 7 is nearly equilateral with less than 1% error
The error is about the thickness of a mechanical pencil lead, so it does not indicate that it is not an equilateral triangle by drawing and rotating it to see if they overlap, etc.
Can you explain this as "not an equilateral triangle" without using the three square theorem, etc.?

I liked this explanation:.
