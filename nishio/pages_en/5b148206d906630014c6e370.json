Customer said, "I don't need X."
	1: [Customer] is in a different environment than the proposer envisioned and does not really need X
 　The assumption that "everyone needs X" is harmful and we should learn well about the proposer's environment
  If it doesn't seem necessary after a thorough understanding, there's no point in forcing it.
　2: Proposer does not understand the value of X
 　This one seems to be more common.
  It is harmful to jump to these other-blind interpretations, so we should dare to consider one first.
  It's hard to find value in something you haven't experienced.
  	Create opportunities for experience through some form of coercion.
   The value of being used by someone you admire
  Especially in the case of Scrapbox, I have a feeling that you won't feel the value until about 6 months to a year after you start using it.
  　The fact that there is now a fee for confidential use within a company is a headwind against this "creating opportunities for experience through coercion" pathway.
   Even if you have a long trial period of six months or a year, it's a pretty tough situation because the fact that "I might be out of here in a year" chills the desire to write.
