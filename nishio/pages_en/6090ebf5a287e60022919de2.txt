 *1202622312*Negative comments
 -The idea of negative comments is already a no-no...! - novtan annex

 Via id:coji. This is a good entry.
 
 - If someone says "you're an idiot" without providing a basis for judgment, that's noise and there's no need to respond seriously.
 - If someone says "you are an idiot" in a judgmental manner, it may be a valuable comment that makes you realize your mistake, which you would not have noticed if you had not written the blog. It is a shame to throw it away because of some poor wording. It is necessary to carefully consider the judgment criteria indicated by the other party.
 
 Here is my summary of the original article. Here is what I thought.
 
 It would be better for our mental health to think of it as this article. However, since human beings are self-justifying creatures, it may be better to fall on the side of "I may be wrong" to achieve balance.
 For example, if you were to be set on fire, of course the arsonist would be at fault, but you might also be at fault for leaving a newspaper under the eaves of the house, which can easily catch fire. For example, if I was snatched by a purse snatcher, of course the purse snatcher was at fault, but I was also at fault for putting my handbag in the front basket of my bicycle. If I get a lot of noise comments on my blog, I think that there may have been something in my entry that attracted the noise. Of course, if you don't mind the noise, or if you think it has the opposite effect of attracting visitors, then you don't need to take measures, but if not, you can make your writing less inflammatory.
 
 This is also evident in the latter case. For example, if someone comments on a sentence you wrote, saying, "Where did you read it that way?" you can consider the other person at fault for misinterpreting the sentence, or you can consider yourself at fault for writing a sentence that could be misinterpreted. With the former, you can say, "XX-san, why don't you go back to elementary school and relearn the Japanese language?" or "XX-san is wrong when he defines x as y." In the latter case, "XX-san, you are wrong when you define x as y." Without a doubt, the other party will argue further and the situation will become a quagmire. In the latter case, the person would say, "Mr. XX, I am sorry for the misleading way I wrote this. In my entry, I used the word "x" to mean "z". So I don't think it will cause the problem you are concerned about. This would make things quieter.
 
 If humans were truly rational beings, we could ignore noise. However, since we are actually quite emotional creatures, we can learn from noise that many people become emotional when we say these things.... And that knowledge can lead to a reduction of unnecessary costs. At least I think so.

 PS: When I was in high school, one of my classmates said to me, "What's wrong with calling a moron a moron? This may have its origin in the thought that "if you call someone an idiot, even if it is true, the other person will be offended.
 
 *1202623756* 2nd 1000 Speakers Conference
 After recruiting last week and yesterday, the participants were successfully selected.
 http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:2
 It appears that the 18 listeners' slots were filled in 23 minutes and the 12 speakers' slots in 1 minute.
 
 Compared to the large number of "people who wanted to hear" in the first recruitment conducted on the amachang blog, it was surprising how relaxed we were after 14 people were filled in 4 minutes of this recruitment for the listening slots. After the event closed, I looked at the event and said, "Sounds like an interesting event! I wish I could have been there!" but I wonder if there are many people who don't try to go and get the chance even if they are actually given the chance....
 
 *1202645362*Sleepy ...
 Mmm. I woke up at noon...
 I knew it. I began to think that I should get up at a certain time every morning.
 I think the headache I had yesterday was due to staying up late and getting up at odd hours.
 I'm going to work tomorrow. I know it's a day off, but I don't know where the fire prevention manager training is being held, which I believe was Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m., so I have to go check it out.
 
 *1202661829* My eyes are starting to glaze over now.
 I don't know...
 If I don't go to bed, I won't be able to get up at a decent hour again tomorrow...
