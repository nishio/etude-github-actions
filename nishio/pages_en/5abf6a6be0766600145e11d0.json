Long-term investment, not altruism
[https://gyazo.com/734142936045032e1cf378b94bf47c2a]
 The discount rate for future value varies from person to person.
 	The figure says hyperbolic discounting, but hyperbolic discounting is different because we are talking about a (irrational) reduction in the discount rate itself [hyperbolic discounting - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%8C%E6%9B%B2%E5%89%B2%E5%BC%95].
  Stanford's [marshmallow experiment] [Marshmallow experiment - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AD%E5%AE%9F%E9%A8%93]
 A person with a higher discount rate estimates a higher future value that is balanced by the current $10,000.
  So we tend to choose "what we want now" from a variety of options.
 When the discount rate is somewhat lower, the average growth rate of people and stocks is greater
 	When it comes to that,
  	Better to invest for the long term in stocks than to get cash now.
   Better to benefit others than to benefit yourself now ([assuming] return)
	Selfish decisions to maximize one's own future profits result in the behavior of "giving to others rather than taking for oneself.
 	This is seemingly [altruistic] behavior.
  But in reality, it's just a [long-term investment].
	Identification of either
 	If for some reason the future [growth rate] of the other party is low
  	Altruism should be unaffected since it has nothing to do with future growth, etc.
   Long-term investments are affected
