Put complex objects in Firestore
Environment object of [Listen-out chat system] was put in [Firestore].

	1: Trying to put obj.__dict__ as is
		â†’`"Cannot convert to a Firestore Value"`
		Some fields are of a type that cannot be put into Firestore
	2: Convert to json
		[defaultdict] changed to dict, KeyError in later use
		TUPLE changes to LIST.
			This is used for dict keys, so it can't be aligned to a list.
			Writing conversion functions

Serialization of complex objects is full of pitfalls
I wrote that after I got stuck, but I should have written a "test to see if what you put in will be restored" from the beginning.
