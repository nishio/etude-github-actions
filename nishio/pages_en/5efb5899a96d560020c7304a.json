[burn fill] [minimum cut].
Burn bury?
　Multiple sub-problems, choices, and costs depending on the choice.
　There is a dependency on the choice of subproblems.
　If the number of problems is about 20, you can solve it with a full search.
　　It can be solved by attributing it to the smallest cut at 10000 or so.
How is it different from →DP?

>I think it's time for the concept of 'burn fill' to go away. Because if you remember the form of Project Selection itself, it's a blink of an eye.
