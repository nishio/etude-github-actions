	In order to see the correlation between the location of the bombing and whether or not the aircraft was able to return home, information on the location of all planes hit and whether or not they were able to return home is essentially required.
 Even if you can't get all of them, you need "a random selection of planes from all planes -"
 But practical constraints dictate that "only returning aircraft can be observed."
 Then, based on the assumption that "the locations hit by bullets are uniformly distributed," we observe deviations from that distribution.
 As a result, the aircraft that was hit in the middle of the wing, where there are few places to be hit, may not have been able to return home, and so on.
