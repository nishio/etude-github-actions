One-word sentence output
[https://gyazo.com/54f93639f8bbc312742e81d6a42db8c9]
	In [Inverted Indexes and Pointing], I wrote that what is needed for pointing behavior is a mapping from observation to location, similar to the inverted index needed for search engines
 Consider [one-word sentence] output as the next developmental stage after pointing behavior
 	Primitive as an algorithm
	 	Finds the position (document ID) from the observed words and selects a word in that document for output.
		This would use the transposition of the mapping W from observation to location
  [AutoEncoder]
 This would eliminate the need for what was once a "place" to be discrete.
 	[Location Continuous]
