People who have only heard of it.
Some people say, "Oh, I know that one," just because they have heard the keyword.
But we don't know anything about what those keywords refer to. It's really "just what I've heard".
These people are worse than "those who have never heard of them". The person who has never heard of them is now, at this very moment, "just someone who has heard of them". They are at the same starting line, but somehow one of them thinks he is leading.

[I've heard of it.]
[Never heard of it.]
[Ignorance].
