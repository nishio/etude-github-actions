Mental models of "use" and "continue"
There are those who express "I use" and those who express "I can't continue" for the same subject.
Where does this difference come from?

People who describe themselves as "using."
 I use it as needed.
  I use it for different tasks."
  I use it when I write manuscripts."
  We don't use it when we don't think we need it.
 They see it as a tool.
 	So I say "use it."

Those who describe themselves as "going on."
 I don't see too many people say, "I'm continuing."
  Look at it in the negative: "I can't go on."
  I failed."
  Is that generally true because some people say, "I've been doing this for about five years?"
 	Is "I've been using it since I became independent" also a continuing expression?
 I see it as something that should be continued.
 	From this perspective, of those who "use" it, those who use it out of necessity are "not using it."

  As far as Pomodoro is concerned, there is the execution part of the task of "turning the timer and working" and the management part of the task of "measuring the number of interruptions and executions...", so there is a tool part and an ongoing task part.
