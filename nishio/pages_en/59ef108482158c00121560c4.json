Cybozu Live
I will collect information on this case because it is interesting from a [technology management] point of view as an example of a free service that grows to 2 million users and then terminates. (Note: The author was not involved in the Cybozu Live project at all, and this page is based on speculation and summary based on public information. The contents of this page are not guaranteed and do not represent the opinions of the organization to which it belongs).

Brief description
 On November 26, 2009, the service was opened to the public in beta on an invitation-only basis.
 In August 2017, the total number of registered users exceeded 2 million.
 Announced on October 24, 2017 that services will end on April 15, 2019.

  >We have decided to terminate "Cybozu Live" against the backdrop of the need for investment, such as fundamental reworking, to continue stable service in the future due to the aging of the system, and the need for further investment in paid services.
  CNET writes [https://japan.cnet.com/] that "the paid version groupware business is strong and further investment is essential to provide a comfortable service to subscribed users, and we have decided that we should focus on the paid version service considering our limited resources." article/35109275/]. The official source is [here https://topics.cybozu.co.jp/news/2017/10/24-4407.html]

Common Reactions
 I'll pay you to continue.
 	[e.g. https://twitter.com/tetsutalow/status/922724533206966277]
  Published Fact: According to [IR https://topics.cybozu.co.jp/news/2017/08/10-4218.html on August 10, 2017] sales are up 15% over last year and recurring profit has been revised down but is still expected to be in the black at 360 million.
  It is not a matter of immediate cash.

Common Response 2
 I want it to be open source.
 	[https://twitter.com/kur/status/922726300321583105 Example]
  A beta version was released in 2009.
  According to a 2010 [Hatena News PR article http://hatenanews.com/articles/201012/2098], the frameworks are Seasar and jQuery.
  Apache + Tomcat + MySQL according to [lecture https://www.slideshare.net/kazfuku/cybozulive-seleniumtest] in 2011
		On September 26, 2016, many of the products offered by the Seasar project are End of Life (EOL) - [http://www.seasar.org/]
   This EOL was announced September 26, 2015 [Seasar Conference 2015 http://gihyo.jp/news/report/2015/10/2701]
  >Attempted to break away from S2Dao with the EOL of Seasar, the Java framework used by Kintone and others.
   [How did we make the wrong technology choice? 2016 - Cybozu Inside Out | Cybozu Engineer's Blog http://blog.cybozu.io/entry/2016/12/28/101500]
		Considering what "the system has become obsolete" and "investment such as drastic reworking is necessary to continue stable service," which are written as the reasons for termination in the release text, it would be difficult to provide the service even if the source code is made public.

Consideration of Nishio
 By announcing the end of the program after 18 months with 2 million registered users, a market of 2 million "Cybozu Live refugees" was created at this moment today.
 Customers discovered by free groupware are freed from lock-in.
 Since there is a year and a half until the end of the program and it will be exported to CSV, we should be able to acquire users efficiently if we add a function that allows migration.
 I have a feeling that various services will be created.
 And since users have experienced that "services hosted by one company will end unexpectedly," they should be concerned about the ease of transition.
 A Mastodon-like approach to Twitter will also emerge.
 A distributed communication infrastructure with a different timescale from Twitter and chat could be created.

 Is it still difficult for a for-profit company to continue to provide free services?
 Good up to the point where the project is launched and delivered, but threatened by dependent frameworks and other EOLs
 Is it impossible for software to continue to be used without being metabolized in the first place, not to mention a for-profit company?
 Does lock-in to services hinder metabolism?
 What should have been the role of groupware as "social infrastructure"?
