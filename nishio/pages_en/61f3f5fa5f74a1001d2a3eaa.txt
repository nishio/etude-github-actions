To suspend things temporarily.
Even if you express your determination to "do it," it will not be highly valued. Only what you do will be evaluated. If you say "I will do it" right away and don't do it, you will be criticized.

Prudent silence is worldly wisdom. Everything should remain a mystery. When we do not reveal what we are doing, but surprise people and draw their attention with surprising results, we are imitating the ways of God.




from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
To suspend things temporarily.
iii

Playing with the cards on the table is futile and futile. If you do not come forward immediately, especially if your position is important and will be noticed by the public, you will create expectations. If you mix a little mystery into everything, that mystery will arouse reverence. And when explaining, try not to be too blunt, so as not to expose your innermost thoughts in normal conversation. Careful silence is the sanctuary of worldly wisdom. A proclaimed commitment is never held in high esteem, but only leaves room for criticism. And if it fails, it is doubly unfortunate. Besides, you are imitating the ways of God when you surprise and watch others.
