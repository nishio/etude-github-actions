I don't want to be practical.
>[tks https://twitter.com/tks/status/1459578339358818312?s=21] I love to talk about Kickstarter gadgets and buying weird stuff on Taobao, but when I meet someone for the first time who doesn't seem to be a geek and they ask me for advice, I tend to respond seriously, "This is something geeks [burn money] to play with, so don't ask for [practicality]. When I'm asked for advice by someone I've never met who doesn't seem to be a geek, I give a serious answer like, "This is something for geeks to play with [burn money], so don't ask for [practicality].

Majority of people want practicality, while [early adopters] base their decisions on "fun" = "[enjoyment]".
