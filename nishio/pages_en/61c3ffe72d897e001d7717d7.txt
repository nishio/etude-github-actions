The process of understanding difficult texts
The reason why [difficult sentences] are difficult is that the words are not used in the dictionary sense (i.e., they are non-parallel symbols)

　[Felt Sense and Symbol Diagrams]

1: Symbols are not parallel, so even if you know the meaning of the symbols themselves used in the book, you don't know what is represented by their combination.
　[There are two patterns to "I don't know."]

2: Then I said, "Oh! Is this what you mean?" And then there is a realization. This is a new felt-sense imagination, and there is no confirmation that this is what the author wanted to express
　[Understanding is a hypothesis.]

3: By repeating this process, the relationships ([RELEVANCE]) between symbols become visible, and as they form a consistent network, the confidence that "this is what the author meant" increases.
　[on the basis of integrity].

The process from 2 to 3 is strongly related to [gaining stability] in [the interference effect of ideas

Scrapbox facilitates the identification of the felt sense an author has for a non-parallel symbol by presenting a summary of "where the non-parallel symbol is used" for that symbol.
　So don't [auto-bracket].
　　Mixture of parallel symbols in a set of pages with links is detrimental
　　It's not about whether it's a string match, but whether it's consistent with the author's felt sense.
　　If it's a string match but you don't feel comfortable linking to it, the string side should change.
　　　[There are three patterns in the results of direct matching.]

The "integrity network" being created in 3 is related to the "author's emulator" spoken of in [weight of "read"].

Thinking about this process from a digital perspective
　If the felt sense is a word2vec-like n-dimensional vector.
　There are 2^N ways to mix two felt senses.
　I don't know which one the author intended.
　Select from among the possible mixtures those that seem to be related (vectors are not orthogonal) when randomly sampled and matched.
