Blind Card Candidate
[Resolution Stage]
	>This is something that should be separated into multiple cards.

　　does not seem to do
　Maybe "The Lake and the Cup" would be better to put in the headline.
　This heading could be confused with [2 non-orthogonal axes

[series of drawings in which two people say different things]

2022-02-17 Adoption
code::
 31 ["is X" and "is not X" are compatible].
		[Two nested concepts in what we thought was one concept].
  	2022-02-17 Almost adopted the above because the content is almost the same
 32 [familial similarity].
 33 [2 non-orthogonal axes].
	34 [There are multiple ways to compromise].
	35 [Move the good stuff].
		[not decreased, but moved out of range of observation].
