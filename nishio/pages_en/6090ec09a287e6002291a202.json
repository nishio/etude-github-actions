 The title is a spoiler.

 What a mysterious blank in sys.argv! Why? Oh, I looked at the Makefile and there is a single-byte space after the backslash at the end of the line!

 But lockfile retries infinitely by default when it fails. Just for the heck of it $ for i in {1..100}; do . /foo.sh; done; so I have a queue of 100 people.
 
 What I wanted to do was "exit without continuing if already started", so I set the number of retries to 0 with -r 0.
