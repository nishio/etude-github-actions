private link
[note on Scrapbox extension I want to make].

use case
	Place files that cannot be published for copyright or other reasons (articles, cut and scanned books) in Dropbox, etc.
 Write a link to it in Scrapbox.
 Write comments, etc. on the file.
 I want to open a link with one click, others should not.

Mounting plan 1
	Set the key to the extension.
	If you write `[secret URL]`, the extension encrypts the URL part and writes it to Scrapbox.
	Third parties viewing the public project cannot follow the link because it is encrypted.
 When displayed, that URL portion is decrypted, and the user who has the extension can use it as if it were just a link.
 	If I put it in the UserScript, the decryption key will be exposed, no?
  Can I use localStorage?

Mounting plan 2
 I didn't want to have a separate database, so I was thinking of having all the information to decrypt the original URL in the URL section.
 	But wait, what?
  You can get row data at `https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/<privateProj>/<pageName>`.
  You could write a correspondence table in Private Project.

visually pleasing design
	`[link to secret description page? Information for restoring original URL]`
		People who don't have the extension can also understand that it's a link they can't follow because they don't have the extension.

Input Method Proposal
	Copy the URL, convert it in Automator and paste it
	Confidential information does not get out.
