Know "what makes an effective team."
[Google re:Work - Guide: "What Makes an Effective Team" https://rework.withgoogle.com/jp/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/]
Analysis done by Google [Project Aristotle].
	The objective is to find "what conditions make an effective team possible?"

The term [psychological safety] was the catalyst for the buzzword.
>The concept of "team psychological safety" was first proposed by Amy Edmondson, who studies organizational behavior at Harvard University.
	see [Psychological Safety and Learning Behavior in Work Teams]

	psychological safety
		Whether you believe it is safe to engage in risky behavior in interpersonal relationships

	Mutual trust:.
		Finish quality work on time?

	Structure and Clarity
		An understanding of what is required by the job and the process for meeting the requirements

	The Meaning of Work
		Whether members feel subjectively meaningful about the results of their work

	impact

I would like to know exactly how each factor was measured (survey statement), but I couldn't find it after searching for a while.
