[Kobe City can offer preferential contracts at higher prices: Nihon Keizai Shimbun https://r.nikkei.com/article/DGKKZO52458680R21C19A1LKA000?s=5]

>The Nikkei, Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, and Kobe Shimbun reported this morning on a new procurement system that allows software developed jointly with startups to be contracted without competitive bidding! This is actually something we had been thinking about since we designed Urban innovation KOBE, and it is more accurate to say that we made up for the last part that was missing! Until yesterday, when people asked me "What do you actually do when you sign a contract with a startup?", I could only give a half-hearted answer, but from today, I can answer with pride. I hadn't released the press release yet, so I had to prepare it in a big hurry today!

>The government procurement system has not been a good fit for startups, but a new contracting system is finally starting in Kobe City.
>It is unfortunate for both parties that even startups that have developed services together from the requirements definition end up in a general competitive bidding process when it comes to a big budget.
>Finally, the big parts fit together.
>I think it is not enough to just have this procurement method, but it is only because Kobe City has created a system that allows "joint development" that it can be utilized.
