Even with regard to orthodox painting, which many people would recognize as "art," the artist did not make his own canvas cloth, nor did he make his own paints.
Most of the material existence of art is not created by the painter himself. Creation is informational.
Art is the creative use of a canvas and paint [medium] and the information on it.

Creation can be [Pollock https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ジャクソン%E3%83%BBポロック]-like.

The creation that takes place informatively does not have to be an external feature. ([Duchamp's Fountain])
 (Supplement: It may be a change in "view," "perspective," or "interpretation.")

The [semantic network] between AI-generated images, [/c3cats], can of course also be art. Has anyone done the same thing before me?
