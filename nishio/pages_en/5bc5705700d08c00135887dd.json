In short, i rotating unit vectors, each with a rotation period of
	Rotation period[$ 2\pi]: [$ \sin(pos), \cos(pos)
	Rotation period [$ 10000 \cdot 2\pi]: [$ \sin(pos / 10000), \cos(pos / 10000)]

We tend to view the concept of [position] in terms of a [number line], which expresses position as a [circular] value. Therefore, given an infinitely long series, "the same position" will always repeat, but if the cycle is long enough, there is no practical problem. Even the earth's surface is actually in a cycle, but in everyday life we think of it as Cartesian coordinates.

It adds them together rather than concatenating them against the input, but that seems to be OK.
