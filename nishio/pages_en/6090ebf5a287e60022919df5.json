 What have you done while I was gone?
 
 *1204276549* Well
 At any rate, I took a quick look and determined that there were no urgent tasks.
 
 So for tomorrow's Haskell Hackathon, all I have to do is be in the lab before 11:00 and open the door?

 Who in this world would be so carefree as to be unable to see the shallow dream beyond today's mountainous terrain, not even to get drunk?

 I go out to the rice paddies to pick greens, and the children of Yamashiro get drunk and dry the algae and leaves.

 I knew Iroha-uta and Tenchi no Uta, but there are so many others.
 
 *1204282493*The Price of PC
 Time sure flies when you don't have a computer."
 
 This is one word for it.
 
 Also, there was an excess of many things. First, toy excess. Most people brought in "enough toys to keep myself occupied without a PC," and if they are not for solo play, they naturally consume other people's time as well, so there is not enough time to play with them. I brought in LaQ and magnets, but I hardly played with them myself. I could only do Catan once. I'm curious about the finished puzzle called Ravensburger's Contact. Someone bought it, but the unopened Twister was left in the dark.
 
 Second, there was an excess of food. Aside from the excessive amount of alcohol and snacks, the grandmother of the inn was so hustled and bustled by the arrival of so many boys around the age of her grandchildren that she obviously overfed them...and then there was the slow decrease in the amount of food served. The number of people in the party had been decreasing, but the amount of food served was decreasing at a slow pace; 10 people could not eat enough for 14. I brought surume (dried squid) and dried sweet potatoes, but there was no room to serve them.
 
 Excess site area. This was good: two rooms on the third floor as sleeping rooms and two rooms on the second floor as food-centered and toy-centered rooms. Since eating is in another room, there is no problem leaving toys and snacks scattered around, which makes them happy. The futon was probably spread out on the third floor as much as possible and left pulled out. It was a good environment where those who wanted to sleep could do so in the dark and those who wanted to play could do so without worrying. It was a good environment for those who wanted to play without worrying.
 
 Acceleration excess. Fujikyu Highland was amazing. Mad Mouse" and "Ee-ay-nai yaanai" are especially w "Ee-ay-nai yaanai" is soulful. Fujiyama was amazing as usual. Someone is going to be liberated. I didn't ride Dodompa, but I will ride it next time. I heard that the internal organs come out of the body.
 
 Grandma's excessive interference. Please don't stay the whole meal>< I could tell that grandma was not running the inn as a job, but as a pastime. She must have been happy to have a boy about the age of her grandson. She told me that she has three grandchildren, three girls, the oldest is studying abroad in the U.S., the second is 22 years old, and that she has an apartment somewhere in Tokyo. Finally, someone decided to let her eat the second daughter's home-cooked meals (though she refused), and congratulations on your reverse ball-busting! It was heartwarming if you think of her as a country grandmother who runs an inn as a hobby. If you think of it in a business-like manner, you shouldn't say to a guest, "I want to wash the rice bowl, so eat the leftover rice," or "Since you are young these days, I took care that you would prefer bread over rice (all breakfast was sweet bread)," or "(to a doctoral student) you are not a doctoral candidate. Well, it made me laugh quite a bit. If you have a tolerance for this kind of grandmother, I recommend it.
 
 There was an excess of things like that. Overall, it was quite interesting and I would like to participate again.

 They said they were going to make a Pythagora device, so I went to the local 100-yen store and bought things like a bamboo stick and hot glue, but ended up not making it, so I had to take it all home with me.
 
 *1204285177*Price of neodymium magnets
 About breaking a pack of 10 pieces of stationery for 100 yen with nippers and taking out the magnets.
 - Maybe it's not a neodymium magnet. And it's weak.
 - Why don't you just buy the magnet directly?
 
 I don't think they will be plating ferrite magnets or samarium cobalt magnets (http://www.rakuten.ne.jp/gold/magnet/samacoba/samacoba-index.html#samamaru), which do not require plating, as they must want to cut costs. I think it's the neodymium magnets that rust easily and require plating... I suspect the weakness is simply due to their small area, but maybe they are weak because they are cheap.
 
 And about the price of neodymium magnets:

 If you buy 1,000 units, the unit price is 18 yen!
