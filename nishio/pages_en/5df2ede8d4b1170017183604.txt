Arguments about rightness are futile.
I got a very concentrated expression, so I wrote it down.

　[Relative to correctness]
　[definition of correctness].
　[Useful Knowledge]

　When you start saying [it is right to be beneficial], you are stepping into another futile discussion of rightness, so it is more beneficial to distance yourself from the discussion of rightness and adopt the attitude, "This is futile for me.
