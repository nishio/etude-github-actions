slow jog
　I was walking with a heart rate monitor and my [heart rate] didn't go up versus swinging my arms and stuff.
　After much trial and error, I've found that the motion of running without moving forward efficiently raises the heart rate.
　　Support your weight with one foot, keeping both feet off the ground.
　Is it because there is not much load on the muscles when I rotate my arms?
　Is it because of the large leg muscles?
　This [exercise] is called a "slow jog."

　Slow jog is good
　My wife and I can walk together and do slow jogs at the same speed as we walk, as appropriate.
　We can load each other at our own pace.
　Moving at the same speed so you can have a conversation and not get bored.
　Can be restrained to a level of load that makes it impossible to have a conversation.
　　My wife's fitbit says that exercise in this zone burns fewer calories, but a higher percentage of fat is burned.
　They say you should imagine jumping rope.
　　Land on the front of the foot, not the heel.
　They can point out any lapses in form.
