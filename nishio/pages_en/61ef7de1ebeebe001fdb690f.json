集合の包含関係が逆
[https://gyazo.com/176ef1662ce0e681421ee8e2fbf1aa26]


An example where X encompasses Y and Y encompasses X, depending on the viewpoint.
	The set of "knowledge shared by A and B" is
 Since it encompasses the set of "knowledge shared by Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C,"
 Shared knowledge f(S) in a set S of persons" means that f(S2) contains f(S1) when S1 contains S2.
 [$ S_1 \subset S_2 \iff f(S_1) \supset f(S_2)]
 　This function f has the property of inverting the inclusion relation, but Mr. P and Mr. Q are unaware of the function's existence.
 　So we call both S and f(S) by the same term, resulting in a disagreement about the inclusion relation

Another case where the inclusion relation of sets is reversed
　[A wraps around B]
　[I know both, but the other person only knows one].

　"General Knowledge" and "Special Knowledge."
　　I would think "general" would be broad and almost encompass "special."
　　Because sometimes "general" is a generalization of "special" that broadens the scope of its coverage.

　If A is a superclass of B, then A encompasses B
　 You may assign B to A, but you may not assign A to B.
　　On the other hand, a "function that takes A as an argument" should not be assigned to a "function that takes B as an argument".
　　　Substituting "a function that takes animals in general as arguments" for "a function that takes only cats as arguments" is unsafe, because it might be called with a dog as an argument.
　　　So the inclusion relation of the set is inverted.
　　　This is called an anti-transformation.
