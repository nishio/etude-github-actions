Don't try to motivate yourself when you are unmotivated.
When we are unmotivated, we think that the "motivated state" is an unconditionally good thing, but is that really true?

Trying to be motivated for a certain task assumes that doing that task is the unconditionally right thing to do, but is that right?

Isn't it good to motivate yourself for tasks you shouldn't be doing?

[unmotivated]
　[I'm not motivated because it's not fun.]
　[Let's make it interesting, not motivational].
　[If you're not motivated, you're not motivated to do the things that will motivate you].
　[Reminds me of what I was going to do, not what I'm going to do].
[Motivation]
