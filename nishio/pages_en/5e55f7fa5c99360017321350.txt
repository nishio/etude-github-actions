Full-size display of image stickies
　You can now [Show images on stickies].
　Small because it is treated as a sticky note
　Sometimes I want it bigger.
　Behavior is similar to "Open Group
　　Folded groups are the size of sticky notes
　　The group that opens is the size of the content inside
　Groups with only paths will be displayed as thumbnails when closed.
　　Close to this.
　So do you want a group?
　　No, that's not right.
　　It's odd to make a group just because it can be opened and closed when it has no child elements.
　　I'd rather only groups be able to open and close because the need to open and close came up first in groups, and stickies can wait for the "thumbnail view/detail view" toggle.
　　Simple text stickies just don't have anything to display details.
　　　When the content is long, the full text can be displayed in detail view at a certain font size, or only the small text or the beginning of the text can be displayed in thumbnail view.
　in other words
　　Full-size display of image stickies
　　Full text display of long stickies
　This means that the stickies need a mechanism that allows for
　Add compact:bool to sticky object, data without it is considered true
　 False when adding image stickies
　　　But this is identified as an image sticky when it's drawn, so I'd hate to rewrite the start there.
　　　It's not right to parse text every time when drawing.

In the future, there may be a need for "[the full-size image is too large, so I want to scale it up or down]".

Implemented.

I thought I needed to add [menu to fold images in full size view], but since I don't need it now, I'll hold off.
