Knowledge and Information
 [Knowledge] and [information] tend to mean similar things and are used without much distinction. Self-caution.
 Organize how you use them in your own way.
 	Knowledge is within the individual.
  It is difficult to transfer knowledge as it is to others.
  For example, by converting it into "information" in the form of writing, etc., the reader reconstructs the "information" in his/her own mind and makes it into knowledge.
  In the [SECI model], "[formal knowledge]" enters the individual through "[internalization]".
   But I don't feel comfortable using the term "[tacit knowledge]" to describe it.
   It's hard to [verbalize]," the implicit process goes in.
   Sometimes you can verbalize it smoothly, and sometimes you can't, no matter how hard you try.

  Items marked with a circle are information
  In the brain, it has a network structure with "connections". This is knowledge.
  The network structure cannot be directly transferred to others. Therefore, it needs to be verbalized.

 I hate [JTB] formulations of knowledge.
