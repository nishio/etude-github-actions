 **1306490384* Improve productivity with keyboard macros and keybindings.
 I want to "add from the cursor to the end of the line to the beginning of the line two lines down."

 If you press any key at the starred area of this, you get one shot.

 I would like to see it changed to The editor is Emacs.
 
 First, start recording a keyboard macro by pressing "Ctrl-x (", do the operation you want to do, and then end the recording by pressing "Ctrl-x )". Next, name the operation with "Meta-x name-last-kbd-macro", which I named send-next. Next, try to insert the macro into the current buffer with "Meta-x insert-kbd-macro".

 (fset 'send-next
    [?\C-k right down ?\C-y up up ?\C-e])

 This seems to be what I just did. I'm going to trigger this when I press Shift-Return, and use local-set-key to set local key bindings (this seems to be a major mode unit scope, so you might have trouble overwriting keys you normally use).

 (local-set-key [S-return] 'send-next)

 At the end of the code, press Ctrl-x Ctrl-e or something to execute the Lisp code.
 
 I'll give it a try. I was able to use Shift-Return to "add from the cursor to the end of the line to the beginning of the line two lines down". That's great.
 
 By the way, when I undo this operation, the first time I undo the pasting, the second time I undo the cutting. It would be nice to be able to undo them all at once. Not that it is really necessary, but it would be nice.
