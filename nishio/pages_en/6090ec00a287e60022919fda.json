 It seems to me that there are two types of productive human activities: one is to create a positive from zero, and the other is to return a negative to zero. When too much attention is paid to creating positives, the process of returning negatives to zeroes seems trivial. As a result, my room is a mess. I need to clean up. Even if I clean up the room and make it a clean zero, it will soon become a negative again, but I have no choice but to keep cleaning it up without giving up.
