 That's cool, pro.
 
 *1241852218*Hara Museum of Art
 It said there was a bus, but it only operated on Sundays. I took a bus bound for Gotenyama Garden.

 I took pictures of the Gotenyama Garden because photography was not allowed inside the museum or in the store. It was striped. Anyway, it was striped. Also, the small rooms were interesting, though they are often overlooked. Like the dark hallway and the 7-segment TV. I wanted to buy an acrylic meniscus-lens-like dish, but it cost tens of thousands of dollars, so I decided not to.

 It's kind of a waste to leave now after having come all the way to the west of Tokyo. It's bright. So I went from the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art to the Mori Art Museum. From Shinagawa, it is only two stops away by changing trains at Daimon.

 I thought it would be small since it was in the same place as the observatory, but it was much bigger than I imagined. 1500 yen allowed me to see the Cassina exhibition that was being held together with the observatory. I even got to see a desk with legs made out of tensegrity.

 I can't get a clean shot with my phone.
 
 ZOOB was 7,000 yen. I was very tempted, but I decided not to buy it immediately. I mean, there was a space where you could actually play and try it out, but it said "4 years old and up" and it was closed at night because it was adult hours. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0007ZYY14?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& creativeASIN=B0007ZYY14">ZOOB 250</a>. I knew it was about $1,000 cheaper to buy it immediately. mmmm.
 
 Hieronymus' work is three-dimensional! Dali and Escher, too. I was quite attracted to a work in which Escher's painting was laid out on a spherical surface, but the precision of the painting was not good enough. It would be better to pay a little more for labor and have a craftsman who understands the importance of the work's finish paint it, really. I remember the disappointment I felt when I picked up a painting and said, "Wow, this is amazing!

 Roppongi Station is full of art.
 
 I'm tired. I've been walking around for about five hours now. My back hurts, and my eyes are dry because of the dry weather. I'm hungry.
 
 *1241876006* I went to the "Kaleidoscope of Vision" exhibition at the Mori Museum.

 The rolling ball was under maintenance and could not be seen. I noticed that the mirror ball sometimes spins backwards. While it is nice to watch the mirror ball, it is also interesting to stand in the corner and watch the corners and light that no one else can see. You are yourself in a kaleidoscope. It's not just a matching mirror, but a mirror that reverses left and right each time. The lamps rotate faster and slower. The chandelier speaks Morse. The video of a Tibetan monk's discussion is rather interesting. And what else? The Jim Lambie stripes I saw at the Hara Museum, but that is a drum in a song performance. Actually, at the Mori Art Museum, there was supposed to be a metal ball rolling around on the stripes, but... well, it's no use regretting something you didn't get to see.
 
 *1241884073* Gokiburi Poker should be "you win when all the cards in your hand are gone".
 I will first explain how strange the original rule of Gokiburi Poker, "You lose if you lose all your cards in your hand," is.
 
 Let X be the first person to start in a play of about 4 players, and let Y be the first person that X successfully attacks. if the first attack fails, then on the turn when Y attacks Y successfully, Y's best move is to attack X because "X with cards already on the field" is the closest to losing. if the first attack does not fail, then Y's best move is to attack X. In this case, it is difficult to know whether it is best for Y to attack X or to attack another player, say Z. However, X is closer to losing because it has one less card in its hand. Therefore, the best move is to attack X. In other words, in either case, Y attacks X in retaliation. X attacks Y again. In the unlikely event that neither player makes the best move and hits Z, Z should of course attack X or Y, who is already wounded, instead of W, who is the fourth and unharmed player.
 
 In other words, with the original rule, if you play it right, it just becomes a fistfight between X, who started the attack first, and Y, who was first mired by X. There is no significance for anyone else. Next, consider the "win when all the cards in your hand are gone" rule.
 
 If X's attack succeeds the first time, Y's best move is to attack Z if "X is unharmed and has one less card in hand" and "Z is unharmed and has no less cards in hand"; if X's attack fails several times and only one card A is in X's hand, X's mindset is "If someone gives me some card and says it is A and I say no to it, then if it is really A, the wound will be deeper. If he says "Yes" and the card is another card, he is forced to take it, but it is not so painful and his hand is not so bad because he has one less card in his hand. On the other hand, if you say yes to a card other than A, for example, B, you don't want to be given a card other than B, for example, A, but it is not so bad if you say no and you are forced to play B. So you say no. So you say No. So, if Y gives a card other than A, he can either give a card other than A and say A, or he can be honest about that card. But X knows that Y will think so, and may answer in the opposite way, and is it right to impose B on X in the first place? More generally, "Is it right to force X to play 'the card that doesn't reduce the number of cards to X's loss'?" to be the case, it is not necessarily so. For example, let's say that X has AA BB CC DD EE FF GG H in his hand and X has 2 cards left, which is not strange at all since each player has 16 cards in a 4-player hand. Pushing H here would eliminate X's chance of losing, right? If you then push any of A~G, at that point X will run out of cards in hand and win. In this case, it is easy to understand because the possibility is zero, but there is no play to push H even if, for example, there are only three cards left. The reason for this is that X will have to settle with two cards remaining, so if the next card he pushes is A, the last card he pushes must also be A to win, and knowing this, X naturally answers not to accept A. If there were four cards left in the hand, pushing H would not be so bad because it would bring him to a choice between A and B.
 
 Well, in the above situation, I think it's OK to push B to X, considering how many cards are left to play. The "win when you run out of cards" rule is much more interesting than the "win when you run out of cards" rule.

 <body>I guess you are not using the basic rule of Gokiburi Poker, which is that when a player is handed a card, he or she can check the card and hand it back to another player. </body>

 <BODY>Isn't it right that if you lose, you lose? <BR>Because the rule is that after the first round, cards are played from those who are detected or those who are not detected, so to speak, from those who made mistakes. <BR>The fact that the cards were lost means that there were many mistakes.... <br>Well, the Germans were not the only ones who made mistakes. <BR>Well, it's a game that the Germans thought up, so you don't have to think too hard about it. <br>They are entertainers. </body> <br><br
