 　Thoughts.
  　Margins at the beginning of the list are useless.
  　If the title is a link, is the ShowLog button unnecessary?
  　　But is explicit manipulation easier to understand than implicit manipulation?
  　It would be easier to see if the head is aligned if the line breaks before the title.
  　Margin between items

　　　I'm not using it on my development PC, so the data is crappy.

	　　I tried to temporarily display a title that looks like it.

　　　Hmmm, the button shrinking and the text sticking out is subtle.

　　I prefer the former.
　The button shrinks because the parent has flex on it.
　buttons with align-items: flex-end; and aligned at the bottom

　 　Ah, that's what happens when the length of the text is mixed.
　I'd like to bring the talk list stored on my phone's local storage to the development PC to try it out.

 I was able to reproduce it on a development PC.

　I was thinking that if I could have a row of buttons to save space, I'd prefer to have a row of buttons, but that's not so good.

	`flex-basis: 110px;` to make the base size the width of the larger button, so the base will wrap around.
	Add `flex-grow: 1;` to both the text and button divs, so that when the text is short, the button div is also stretched, and when it is stretched enough, it becomes a single row.
	Use `text-align: right;` to right-align the button. The right edge of the button will be aligned no matter what the div of the button is.
	Buttons sticking out above text is tacky.

		`align-self: flex-start;` and `align-self: flex-end;` to make text above and buttons below
　Lightly ink the list area and add a shadow similar to that of a button.
		`background: #eee;`
  `box-shadow: 0px 3px 1px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%), 0px 2px 2px 0px rgb(0 0 0 / 14%), 0px 1px 5px 0px rgb(0 0 0 / 12%);`
　It's done.
