　In the process of creating the English translation on Scrapbox, I thought, "Let's assign unique numbers to the headings. The reason:.
　It's hard to reference by page number when it's in digital form instead of a paper book.
　Headings are natural to use as titles, but there are headings that appear multiple times, such as "Summary
　This was so useful that we did the same for the table of contents of this Japanese version
　When there is a mention on Scrapbox, it will be a blue link
　We have decided to put the added articles not included in the book version in the table of contents as additional content.
