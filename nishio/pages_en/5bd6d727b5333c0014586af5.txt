Convert from local to world coordinate system
[Transform.TransformPoint]
code:cs
 public Vector3 TransformPoint(Vector3 position);

>Transforms position from local space to world space.
>Note that the returned position is affected by scale. Use [Transform.TransformDirection] if you are dealing with direction vectors.
>You can perform the opposite conversion, from world to local space using [Transform.InverseTransformPoint].
