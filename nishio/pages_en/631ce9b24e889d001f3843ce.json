 	See what difference the output makes
	Is there a difference between "by X" and "in X style"?
	I have 9600 cat images generated by Stable Diffusion and 600 of them labeled "good" by Mr. and Mrs. Nishio, and I have a feeling that it's time to let the computer create the prompts!

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1568973539138732032 @nishio]: I've got a little over 10,000 output results from Stable Diffusion and a list of 600 good images to choose from, with a high success rate. I created a mechanism to automatically generate the prompt itself by combining the elements of the prompt.
> I have modified the script to create and save a folder for each prompt, so if I merge them as they are, I will have a lot of "folders with only one image", should I put the images generated by the auto-generated prompts in one folder?

>Oh, no, I failed to save the generated prompts and I'm in the dark about how they were created.
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1568986169307983872 @nishio]: fixed and computer generated prompts are now saved.

Unfortunately, the AI did not write the prompt to a file, so we will never know what kind of prompt it used to create the picture. Yet another AI said it is "an #artdeco painting of a cat on a hill, in #LouisWain style." #ComputerCreatedCats using #StableDiffusion"]
