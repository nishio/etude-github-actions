Justification of suffering
	There are times in our lives when we suffer [pain].
 	Specifically, images such as seeing losses incurred due to one's own stupidity.
 Not that this kind of suffering is not an aspect of human development.
 Sufferers do not want to believe that their suffering was futile, so they tend to make excessive sense of it
 	[Justification], [Self-justification]
 The idea that others should suffer similarly as a result of finding meaning
		This idea is harmful.

	From the [Buddhist] point of view
 	[Life is full of suffering.
  [The Four Noble Truths].
  	Tolerance of suffering: understanding that everything and everyone is suffering
   Gathering: understand that it is your own desires that create the suffering.
   Understanding the truth: "When greed is eliminated, all suffering is eliminated.
   Tathagata: Understand that by [the Eightfold Path], which begins with [right view] and [right thought], we can destroy greed.

In the third part of the Lotus Sutra, the parable of the parables, we read
>If you are a man of small wisdom and deep love and greed, for this reason I have taught you to give up suffering.
>If sentient beings do not know the source of suffering, they will be deeply affected by the cause of suffering and will not be able to renounce it for a while.
> If greed is destroyed, there is no room for dependence.
