Experience process and perceived meaning

Experience process and perceived meaning
What does it mean?
	"the process of experience and the creation of [* meaning]."
 There are several dimensions.
　 Relationships among linguistic symbols
  Relationship between the symbol and the object
  Besides this, there is the dimension of "experience."
  　[nishio.icon]The translations of the terms "experience" and "experience" are shaky, but both are Experience.
 Dimensions of Experience
　 Easy to understand when "the symbols [* do not] properly symbolize the meaning we experience."
 　>waving, pointing, talking at length, coming up with metaphors, giving examples, silence to find words
 　 [nishio.icon]In other words, there is a fuzziness, excitement, and discomfort that I can't quite put my finger on.
 　This state is described as "We are experiencing a meaning
　　　Another way to say "we feel a meaning" means the same thing
　　>We notice that "symbols that usually seem to contain our meaning do not seem to be appropriate to this present sense of meaning.
  > In other words, meaning is not just a matter of things or symbols or their relationship... It is also something that is felt and experienced.
　　Since this paper deals with this kind of "meaning," I will use the expressions "felt meaning" and "experienced meaning.
　　The Japanese translation is considered "felt meaning."
　　　It comes up many times after this as a single lumpy phrase, "felt meaning."
	　　How does perceived meaning work in cognition?" is the theme of the book.
  [nishio.icon]The Japanese translation process has broken it up into different symbols, making it difficult to understand the relationship between the symbols.

		  In later Thinking at the edge, felt sense is often used, and the Japanese translation is "[felt sense]," which is refreshing.
