(1.3.4) Learn from one end
[https://gyazo.com/52ee86672fc90a13bc31e9bdc6ba6f44]

If you can not gather information roughly, there is only one thing to do from one end.

Even if you read the table of contents to get the rough picture, sometimes you feel nothing you understand. The phenomenon often occurs when you learn new domains. The cause is the lack of materials to build understanding. (*1)

The words in the table of contents are often already abstracted. If you do not have the knowledge that can support the abstract concept, you can not understand it by reading the table of contents.

 1: To understand the table of contents, you need supporting information.
 2: Compared to detailed understanding, rough understanding requires less information.
 3: When you do not have enough information, you can not understand the table of contents.

We often think about what we should learn for efficient learning. However, when you do not have a material to judge what to learn, to think about it is a waste of time. First of all, you need to get materials to think.

Footnote:

	*1: For example, let's say a section title is "[law of diminishing marginal utility]." It says "[marginal utility]" is diminishing. To understand it, you need to know the concept "marginal utility." To understand the concept, you need to know the concept "[utility]" in economics. Those pieces of knowledge are [stack]ed.
