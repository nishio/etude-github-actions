Not necessary.
When Mr. A says that he does not "[need]" a certain X, it is not that he objectively "does not need" X, but that he subjectively "does not feel the need" for it

Necessity depends on the situation.

If X is "[useful] though not [essential]" in a certain situation, those who do not understand its usefulness say it is not necessary, while those who do understand it say it is necessary.
