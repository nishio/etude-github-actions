Risk of doing nothing
Often "[risk]" is not used in the sense of [diversification] when people say, "The risk of doing nothing is greater." To be precise, it would be "doing nothing has a negative expected value." But the majority of people in the world don't understand the concept of greater or lesser variance, it's just fluff and accepted.

The act of taking a 500 yen coin out of a wallet and throwing it into a river is very low risk. There is no [uncertainty] in the profit/loss. Because it is -500 for sure.
