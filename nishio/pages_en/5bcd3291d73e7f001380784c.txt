Man, Machine and Discrimination
>"AI discriminated against women!" in response to the fact that the AI, having learned "data resulting from human personnel adoption decisions," had given negative weighting to women. but that's not true. The human who created the original data was unknowingly discriminating against women, and the statistical process of AI revealed it. Why are humans putting themselves on the shelf and criticizing AI?
