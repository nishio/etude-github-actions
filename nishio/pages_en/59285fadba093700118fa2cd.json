Same" and "different" go hand in hand.

	Another expression of rereading
  It is easy to assume that "the same" and "[different]" are incompatible, but this is because we assume that X and Y are a single point, and when both are a "set," a situation can arise in which "the sets are not [equal], but have a large overlap. In that case, if you focus on the common part, they are 'the same,' and if you focus on the rest, they are 'different.

 When we say, "X is Y (the same as) Y," we are thinking "X=Y" if we consider X and Y as a single symbol.
 However, if the assumption of a single point is incorrect,
  If X or Y is a set
 There could be a discrepancy between X and Y.
 In that case, it is compatible for X to be (nearly) the same as Y and for there to be a difference between X and Y.
 It is not "the same," but "the sets overlap significantly," or, to use a softer expression, "[are] similar."
