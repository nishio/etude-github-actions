Genius Channel
>I created a genius channel on my company's Slack. Whenever a comment is made on a public channel with the emoji "Genius! emoji on a comment in a public channel, the comment will be automatically streamed to the Genius channel. Only the comments that have been called geniuses by others will flow, so it's a great channel [where wisdom gathers on its own]. It's fun to watch.
