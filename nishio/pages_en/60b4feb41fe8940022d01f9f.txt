> Article 8 of the Bill states that the Prime Minister may request users of land, etc. within the gazetted area and other related parties to report or provide materials concerning the use of land, etc.
> Fear of being forced to provide information on neighbors and others who conduct surveillance activities at bases and nuclear power plants because they will be punished if they do not comply.

[Drones] have played a very big role. They have been able to go over the fence of the U.S. military bases and capture images of what is happening in Takae and Henoko. They are preventing us from doing this. This is completely ridiculous.
