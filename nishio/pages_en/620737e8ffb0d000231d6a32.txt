Nobility of feeling.

There is a certain distinction in the soul, a nobility that impels it to brave deeds, that gives the whole personality an air of elegance. This is not often seen, for it is predicated on grandeur. Its chief characteristic is that it speaks well of its enemies and behaves even better toward them. It shines brightest when the opportunity for revenge presents itself. Not only does it miss that opportunity, it improves it by taking advantage of a complete victory to show unexpected generosity. This is a stunning stroke of policy, nay, the very pinnacle of statecraft. It does not feign victory. For it does not feign anything, for while it reaps its rewards, it conceals its achievements.
