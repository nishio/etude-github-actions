New Technology and Publication Bias

　I think the painter is refraining from stating that he is interested in it because there are so many statements on Twitter expressing dislike for it as far as I can observe.
　　In fact, talking to the painters around me, they're doing research, but they're not tweeting.
　I think at some point we'll "suddenly" be in a positive utilization trend.
　　In fact, it should not be out of the blue, but rather being studied behind the scenes right now. It looks sudden on the surface.

Seems to be related to [publication bias] in a broader sense.
　Radical [noisy minority] shouts "[outrageous]" at [new technology
　It keeps moderate people from disclosing "what they are trying".
　This creates a bias that falsely assumes that "outrageous" is the will of the people.
　When someone takes a risk and starts publishing a case study, it gets published like an avalanche.

 	> It was early October when I started working as an AI painter. NovelAI had just appeared and there was a lot of controversy on twitter.
  > Although it has only been a little over three weeks since we started our activities, we have already reached about 20,000 followers on pixiv and about 1,000 followers on twitter.
		> On twitter, there are some who say, "I hide pictures with AI tags. Some people say that "pictures must be drawn by humans," but the fact that this was merely "the opinion of a vocal minority" was clearly evident when looking at the number of users of their own accounts on pixiv. For the majority of users, it does not matter whether the erotic picture displayed in front of them was drawn by an AI or a human, as long as it is erotic and cute, it will directly lead to a number in the form of a rating.
		>... I may have experienced what is called "first-mover advantage" for the first time in my life.
  [" The reality is that if you are simply erotic and pretty, that directly translates into a number in the name of evaluation.]
   [Most people can only understand simple, straightforward stimuli.]
