Man does not deal with other men, but with Heaven
>Do not make man your opponent, but make heaven your opponent. Do your best with the heavens as your opponent, and do not criticize others, but ask yourself what you lack in sincerity.
 [Saigo Takamori] "[The Legacy of O. Nanshu]"
 [blame others, not yourself].
