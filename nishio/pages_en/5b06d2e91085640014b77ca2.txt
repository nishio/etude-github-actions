Brag about your solution.
In educating newcomers
	When I say, "Ask me about [something] you don't understand," he refrains.
 Tell me when you find something troublesome and I'll brag about my solution! I'll brag about my solution technique!"
 Everybody's talking about it.
 It's a [game] where you [brag] to each other and if they know, you lose.
