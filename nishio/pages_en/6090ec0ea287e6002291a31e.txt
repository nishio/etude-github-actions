 *1429447282*I bought a custom made cat stray tag from Amazon.
 Amazon also offers custom-made products? I didn't know that.
 
 When you place an order on Amazon's website, you receive an email from the marketplace address asking you questions about what you want engraved, font and pattern options, etc. When I responded, I received an email on the same day saying that the order had been shipped, probably because it was not busy in our case, and the actual product arrived from Miyazaki in about two days.
 
 I guess I can get these custom orders from Amazon. It seems like the market is expanding more and more.
