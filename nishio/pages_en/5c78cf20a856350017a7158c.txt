Don't take what you suddenly think is too good to be true
>As I have already mentioned, valuable ideas will occur to you during the process of making a piece of paper, organizing a group, creating an A-type diagram, or creating a B-type text. We should never underestimate the importance of these "spur-of-the-moment" ideas. The most important purpose of the KJ method is that these small ideas, however modest they may seem, can produce a cumulative effect that eventually yields a very valuable and large harvest.
[Continuation of Idea Method] p.107

I instruct people to write down on sticky notes anything that comes to mind while working on the KJ method, even if it seems irrelevant at first glance.
That's because [if you don't write it down, you forget it] and I think forgetting is "doing it poorly".
