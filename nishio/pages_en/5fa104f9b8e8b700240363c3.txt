　Thoughts.
　　Sometimes it is more profitable to pay the travel cost and go to another city than to stay in the first city for T minutes and keep getting A1.
　　At this time, the destination city must have a larger Ai to gain
　　When moving from one city to another, staying in the middle of the city is not an optimal solution.
　　Therefore, "go to town i in the shortest distance, spend some time and come back" is the optimal solution, and find out which i is the correct answer.
　　First [Dijkstra method] to find the shortest distance to each town
　　Choose the largest score
　Official Explanation
　　WA: Problem condition misunderstanding, road is not two-way
　　The way home is not a single starting point
　　If we invert the → edge and do the Dijkstra method, we can also do the shortest path with a single endpoint.
