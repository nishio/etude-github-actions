visual thinking
>[4mimimizu https://twitter.com/4mimimizu/status/1406866609709322241]: Visual thinking, in Japan, is somewhat like thinking while drawing a picture, but what and how to think is Visual thinking is a way of thinking while drawing pictures. I don't think it is yet clear what and how to think visually. I don't think that mechanically drawing pictures = visual thinking.

I feel that the hand skills to draw and the way of thinking are connected, but they are competing against each other. I think it's because the thinking of a person who was originally logical becomes visible visually, and the work of a logical person to translate it into pictures is rare, so maybe it looks like GRARECO = logical.

Thinking with abstract concepts is a highway, but often people get stuck off the highway. This happens when they are unable to map abstract thinking to concrete things.
In the following, painting applies pressure to express an "abstract concept" in a "tangible, drawable object," thus encouraging the abstract concept to take on a concrete form.
In the following experiment, by writing the abstract concept of "creativity" in pictures, mapping to "images of growing plants" and so on occurred.
