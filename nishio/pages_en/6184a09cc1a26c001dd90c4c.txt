Where did you go?
[https://gyazo.com/284430c67cfdec587d643487b2a1e0a1]
	I said, "Huh? Where did that thing go that was here?"
 Wife: "What are you looking for?"
 I said, "No, I don't know what you're looking for, but I need to know where everything that was around here went."
 Wife: "Don't you know what you're looking for?"

My wife seems to have a function `item→place` in her brain that comes up with a place when I specify an object, but I use a function `item[]→item` that takes a list of objects and selects the one I need now, so I can't do it when she asks me to specify `item`.
