I started the New Year by observing a case of "an old man who seems to be well respected in his field of expertise, who takes a position of [strike for now] against something he doesn't [understand] well and finds evidence to deny his claim, but his [pride] gets in the way and he cannot [admit his mistake], so he develops unreasonable logic and spreads his wounds. I want to keep in mind "don't deny something you don't understand" and "apologize quickly if you seem to be wrong" as a lesson to learn from the case of "an old man with a disease that will kill him if he apologizes. #Old man
