Physics keeps slides from getting too close.
from [physics improvements].

	Phenomenon of slides approaching each other in [Physics].
 	In the first place, it's not right to get close to the slides, because if the physics happens, it means the slides are crowded and colliding.
  This is why I stayed away from it. Like this
code:cs
 // update position
 for (int i = 0; i < slides.Count; i++)
 {
     GameObject obj = slides[i] as GameObject;
     // current position and distance
     Vector3 cpos = obj.transform.position;
     float cdist = (cpos - eye).magnitude;
     // next position and distance
     Vector3 npos = cpos + updateVec[obj];
     float ndist = (npos - eye).magnitude;
     if(ndist < cdist)
     {
         npos = eye + (npos - eye).normalized * cdist;
     }
     obj.transform.position = npos;
 }
