2019 Python Trademark Case
2019-07-24 "Python" is [trademark] registered by "Arc Corporation" on social networking sites.

I want to get the facts straight, not the "it's outrageous" emotionalism.

	The trademark has been registered for "Python."
		Applicant:Arc Corporation Filing Date:2017/05/25 Registration Date:2018/05/11
		This topic is not about "filed" but "registered".
		[JPO page https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/TR/JP-2017-070713/231A58A15EE53B68C16877A0481BAC0D70532BD150168AF44F6FF664579F5078 /40/en]
	No software is included in the target.
		Therefore, Python as a programming language can no longer be called Python
	There is concern that the "education and training training" of the 41 target groups may affect the workshops and other activities that teach Python.
		>Education and training training related to business management of organizations and business change management, business improvement, and logistics initiatives; education and training training to improve management, communication, sales, leadership, and human resource development skills; education and training to improve management, communication, sales, leadership, and human resource development skills Provision of consulting, advice, guidance, and information on training; production of educational, cultural, and entertainment videos (excluding those for films, broadcast programs, and advertisements); production of films, performances, theatrical performances, and other entertainment videos (excluding those for films, broadcast programs, and advertisements) Provision of facilities for movies, performances, plays, music, or educational training
  > 41A01 41E05 41K02
		My motivation is to organize here because it is not desirable for society to discourage people who are trying to do a study group.
	The inclusion of periodicals and e-periodicals in other groups is another thing I don't like.

	Examples of prior use

>Message from me, a PSF Contributing member, regarding the Python trademark issue. When trademark issues arise, PSF indicates on the following page that you should contact PSF and PSF will handle the issue and not respond individually. I have already contacted the PSF from me on this matter as well, and they have commented that they will confirm the matter.
>The PSF is aware that Python has been a trademark application for over a year now, and PSF's legal counsel has investigated and determined that it is a different trademark category and will not be affected. The PSF trademark team has contacted us to let us know that this is the case.

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1526207373853196288?s=20&t=UFCH9dtEzGjw7iqSv4w4ww @nishio]: the trademark for "Python" that was filed and registered in 2017 by Arc, Inc. I wondered what happened as a result of the Python Software Foundation's cancellation trial for the registration, but the registration was cancelled and the trial costs were borne by ARC. This April.

>The Python Software Foundation had announced that it would take appropriate action, but in May of last year, it filed a request for a trial for cancellation of non-use (Publickey article on which Kurihara commented). A non-use cancellation trial is a right to cancel a trademark registration that has not been used for more than three years upon request of a third party. In the case of an invalidation trial, the applicant must prove that the application was filed for fraudulent purposes, which is a high hurdle in this case, but in the case of a trial for cancellation of non-use, the trademark owner must provide evidence of proper use.
> Then, just recently, on April 20, a trial decision was made to cancel the trademark registration for all designated goods and services of Arc, Inc.
