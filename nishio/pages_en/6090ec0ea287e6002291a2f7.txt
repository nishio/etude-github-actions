 *1407304716* An example of a "model being modified cycle".
 It was pointed out that <a href="http://gihyo.jp/lifestyle/feature/01/engineer-studying/0003?page=2">"The Cycle of Models Being Modified"</a> in Chapter 3 of "How Engineers Learn" has no specific examples, so < strong>explained using examples from other companies that have been published</strong>.

 I used as an example the actual phenomenon reported by Mr. Shinta Nakayama, which occurred at Dorikom. (p.23-37)

 *1407309920* Is mathematical induction not induction?
 In the example of induction in <a href='http://gihyo.jp/lifestyle/feature/01/engineer-studying/0003?page=1'>"How to Learn to Be an Engineer," Chapter 3</a>, I give an example of mathematical induction, but I was asked if mathematical induction is not an induction I was asked if mathematical induction is not induction, so I wrote an explanation.

 Through discussions with id:shuyo on why the claim "mathematical induction is deduction" was born, I came to the understanding that "with the introduction of Peano's axiom, the steps in which induction was used in mathematical induction before that were replaced by the "definition of natural numbers" and only deduction remained". So I also included Peano's side of the argument.

 <body> I suspect that this misunderstanding is due to the fact that many propositions that are often cited as examples of mathematical induction are easier to understand if proved in general rather than by building up from lower levels. </body>

 <body> As I recall, there is a variant of the infinite descent method used by Fermat, which states that if a constant is specified for a given relation and the relation holds, then it follows that the relation holds for a smaller constant number, and thus the lower finiteness of the natural numbers negates the existence of the relation.ã€€This is a method of denying the existence of the relation due to the downward finiteness of the natural numbers. <br> The reason why mathematical induction is not properly recognized is probably because it is easy to give an example of a relational expression that is valid even if it is not on the whole ordered set of integers. </body>
