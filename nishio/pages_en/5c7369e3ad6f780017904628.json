Generation of arbitrary associations between personal records is the basis of memory
>In a 1992 paper, Michael Buckland suggested that [memex] was flawed because Bush did not understand informatics well and had uncommon ideas about cataloging and taxonomy, and that "Bush believed that the generation of arbitrary [associations] between individual records was fundamental to memory and , wanted [memex], not [index]. The result is personalized, superficial, and essentially self-destructive design," he wrote.

The claims of [Vanever Bush] are critically mentioned, but my experience with [Scrapbox] is,
	between the objective information of records.
	Making personal and subjective associations (=[associative connection])
is an important element of memory, I feel, so I guess I agree with Bush.
