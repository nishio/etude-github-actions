[I want to organize what I'm going to talk about in my midterm presentation.]
ã€€Tutorials will be made available in multiple languages after the implementation of the main functions is complete and the UI and explanations are stable, which is not now.

ã€€I'm sure I haven't written the URL anywhere yet, but that's hilariousðŸ¤£.

Rectify a metaphor into a direct metaphor and make it a plain word.
>- If you put the kozane into a rigid subjective classification, they will suffocate and die.
>+ Kozane is like fish. If you put them into where they can not swim, they will die.
The original text of [classification is not the purpose] was this
>When a card is placed in a tightly defined classification system, it often suffocates and dies.
[I am too good at Japanese], so I unconsciously use difficult words, but if that doesn't convey what I want to say, it's a complete disaster.

I wonder if Grammary has a "no difficult words mode" or something.

Oh, I thought the second one was OK, but it's not.
I added a third and now I can log in.

Thinking about taking a video of me actually using it.
ã€€Difficult to use because the long sentence splitting function has not yet been implemented.
ã€€Thinking about doing it in Regroup.
ã€€I lost track of what I used at the Boost meeting (reusability is...
ã€€I still need a "list of what you've made" for each user, and I'd like to have a search for it.

The tutorial doesn't say how to reopen a saved file."
ã€€certainly
	You should be able to see a list of what you have created with that account.
		And it should be searchable.
		The place should be named.

If you're thinking about gathering feedback, maybe the Scrapbox forum approach would be better?

I took a video of the operation.
ã€€YouTube is mysteriously taking a long time to process and I can still only see SD quality.

In terms of how to gather feedback, since the tutorial is in English, why not crowdsource an hour of screen recording?

digital tin can
Unlimited size field
small stature
small bill
scene (of a play, movie, etc.)
knee-swing (gymnastics)

[Hopefully we can find a way to cut an interim presentation].
ã€€Start with a demo and conclude with a call for additional features.

Why did you do it this time in Regroup instead of Kozaneba?
ã€€Kozaneba implemented "in and out of groups" first with the idea that technically uncertain items should be verified first.
ã€€This is a feature that was put on hold because it could not be implemented in Regroup, and is beneficial but not essential.
ã€€Features that were essential for this purpose
ã€€ã€€Re-dividing stickies
ã€€ã€€Enlargement of Important Sticky Notes
ã€€ã€€(Import from Keicho)

I'd love to do the demo in Kozaneba though!

It's been about 5 hours and I still haven't finished processing the HD.
ã€€YouTube glitch?

If you watch your own operation videos back to yourself, you'll see the frequent operating errors and problems with the specifications.
ã€€After selecting the lasso, drag on the sticky to move only the sticky.
ã€€ã€€The specification is correct that only some of the stickies in the selection do not move.
ã€€You're missing it after adding a single sticky note.
ã€€ã€€Because the position of appearance is determined by world coordinates and not relative to the screen
ã€€ã€€I'm only adding one sticky in the Add Multiple Stickies dialog.
ã€€ã€€This will be in the upper left corner of the screen.
ã€€Cannot be deleted on its own, so it is enclosed and deleted.
