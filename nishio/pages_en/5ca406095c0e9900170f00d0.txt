	For example, if there is a string ABC and the lexical set contains each letter and AB, and if [$ p(AB) > p(A)p(B)] holds, then the division "AB/C" has a larger p(x) than the division "A/B/C".
	And with this method, you have to give V in advance, so you start with a large enough vocabulary and prune away.
