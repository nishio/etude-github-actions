The "no resemblance at all" is not true.
If one person A says, "X and Y are similar," to which another person B replies, "X and Y are not similar at all," then "not similar at all" is not true.

Both "like" and "unlike" are merely interpretations.

Therefore, it is futile to discuss whether they are "similar" or "dissimilar". Because neither exists as an objective fact separate from the individual.

The fact is that "there are people A who feel "similar" and people B who feel "dissimilar" about the same subject X and Y." Digging deeper into why this phenomenon is occurring is the key to constructive discussion.
