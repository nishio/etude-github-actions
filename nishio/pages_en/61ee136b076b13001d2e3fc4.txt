Two ways to use the word "culture
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485156690970685440]: I saw an explanation that you need to be educated to understand "Haru wa aeapoyo", but most of the educated people in the world don't find that pun funny. Most of the educated people in the world don't find the pun funny, so it's not a "joke for the inside, not funny for the outside" kind of thing...
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485158391186354183]: Personally, I find "Haru wa aeppoyo" funny, but when people say "You need to be educated to be able to understand this! I feel like "No, why do I need to understand this? I feel like, "No, I don't need to understand this!

>[satoru_takeuchi https://twitter.com/satoru_takeuchi/status/1485160039308427266]: I wonder if the culture described in these examples is just knowledge shared by people who belong to a particular community in society. I think so. In other words, "Do you know that spring is in full bloom?" is similar to "Do you know that the filth is disinfected?
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485161056838492164]: yes, yes. There is no difference in essence between "I can get through that anime story because we watched the same anime" or "I can get through the celebrity infidelity story with you because we watched the same wide show". I find it strange that you say that as if knowing that is a noble thing...
　So you use knowledge as a [merkmal] to identify within and outside the community.

Curiously, distant areas have the same language and close areas have a different language. The prevailing theory is that the language established the identity of the village. The same may be true of culture, where people try to create a language that is understood only by their inner circle and gain an identity.

	[https://www.weblio.jp/content/あげぽよ Meaning and usage of "Aeppoyo" Weblio Dictionary]
 	>A youth word used mainly by junior high and high school girls, meaning "in a state of high spirits" or "in a state of high spirits," etc. It won the silver award in the 2010 "Mobile Phone Buzzwords for Junior High and High School Girls" and the bronze award in 2011. It won the silver prize at the 2010 Mobile Phone Buzzword Awards for Junior High and High School Girls, and the bronze prize at the 2011 Mobile Phone Buzzword Awards for Junior High and High School Girls.
　　It's a buzzword from 10 years ago, so it's probably not in vogue anymore.
 >[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485169035390369795]: Oh, I just realized that I used "outsider" to mean "non-Japanese speaker". I realized that this interpretation is also possible when I saw the reaction "I am an outsider who doesn't understand aeppoyo".
 	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485169511095750656]: it's not "it's not funny because you don't know Ate Poyo", it's "most of the educated people in the world don't know "Spring is Akebono" as this string of letters. I meant "they can't understand the pun that matches the sound.

>[Luzwell https://twitter.com/Luzwell/status/1484670319277514752]: I came to the conclusion that all the "culture" stories on Twitter were all from textbooks, and I thought, "I see, we were all talking about common memories. I see, we were all talking about common memories".
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485422645974016008]: I see what you mean. I know what [uncomfortable] is. My image of an "educated person's conversation" is one in which both people have a great deal of "knowledge that the other doesn't have," and they bring that knowledge up in response to the situation of the conversation, and the other person says, "That knowledge is interesting! The other person says, "That knowledge is interesting! It is almost the opposite of "joking based on common knowledge."
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485424734636748803]: Saying "You don't know this?" when the other person doesn't know something is like pointing and laughing when the other person drinks water from a finger bowl, to use a table manners analogy. It is like pointing and laughing when the other person drinks water from a finger bowl. It does not mean that you understand manners. You may have superficial knowledge, but you do not understand the proper application of that knowledge. The same goes for culture.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485447846971473924]: I heard that Konosuke Matsushita used the catchphrase "[one day rest, one day education]" when he introduced the two day week.
>In other words, in this case, culture is not "what we all learned at school about the same things," but "what we learned spontaneously after we entered the workforce," and since there is no descent curriculum, what each person learns is different.
 >[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1485451002526695425]: In other words, there is a group of people who use the term "culture" to refer to "what we all learned in school" and another group of people who take it for granted that they will continue to learn [independently] after school and consider "what they gained through that [independent] learning" to be "culture. One group of people thinks that it is natural to continue learning [independently] after school, and the other group of people thinks that "what is obtained through that [independent learning]" is "culture", and the members of one group do not agree with what the members of the other group are saying.
