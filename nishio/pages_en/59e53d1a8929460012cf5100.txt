Life Strategy Games
I think it would be a good idea to make [life strategies] into a worker placement type game.
	Players are given a certain number of tokens each turn (time)
  Three tokens, for example.
 Placement of this
  Going part-time gets you money.
  Paying to go to school gives you skills.
   There are about A to J skill places and you can decide where to put one point.
   D. degree if you accumulate a certain number of specific skills.
  Employment (fixed term/permanent) remains token placed unless expiration, termination, or other reason occurs
   Post is naturally limited.

 stock (company)
  You get 1 gold every round (dividend)
  The first purchase is fixed at some higher amount.
  After that, auction at the timing when someone wants to sell.
 heritage
  There is a difference in the initial starting amount.
  Those who drew the "Heritage" card start with money.
   However, a catastrophe occurs in the middle of the game
   Like incarceration.
   I hear the shares go to zero.
  class card
   Gain +1 knowledge tokens only 3 times during the game
  non-production class card
   Instead of giving nothing, the victory condition changes to "not being the last one".

 Chance Card
  Or a project generation that only people with certain skills can participate in.
