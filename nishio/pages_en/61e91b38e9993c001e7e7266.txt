(2.2.4.1) "Recently notified" is not "urgent"
We often tend to confuse '[recently notified]' as '[urgent]'. 

If you do not write out your tasks, you will feel [anxiety] that you might forget the notified task. This anxiety makes you misunderstood that you must do the task immediately. You may start the notified task by putting aside an important but not urgent task you are doing now.

You should record the notified task first to avoid the [anxiety of forgetting]. Then you can think about the task at your own pace.

The first thing to think is, whether the task is important to you.

If it is important to you, it is OK to accept the request. In that case, the new-coming task takes time from other tasks.
You need to be careful not to take time away from a task in ❷, which is important but not urgent. Stop a task which is not important to you.

For example, if the incoming task is requested from another person, you can negotiate as to stop another ❸ task as a condition to accept the request.
