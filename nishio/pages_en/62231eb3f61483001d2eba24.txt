Re: naming the brig of one's knowledge
from [/unnamedcamp/name your knowledge camp].
For example,
 [Mind Garden]
　[potato fields in brain]
　[my castle].
Such as.

By creating such a metaphor, it is possible to go one step further and speculate on what is being done there. We may be able to see what is missing or unnecessary.
　Things like, "It's a field, it needs to be watered," or "It's a castle, it needs repairs."

However, be careful not to be too drawn to the name (metaphor).
　If the gap between what you are actually doing and the metaphor grows, you should expand or modify the metaphor.

 Of the three above, I was uncomfortable with the castle, and dare I say it, the garden, but I was also somewhat uncomfortable with that, and after thinking about it for a while, I realized that "all three are outside my body."
 In my case, it's in my own gut.
 There is a [dark cave] and there is a [subterranean lake].
 　It's not quite to scale with the real physical body, but it's still pretty wide.
　Sometimes [a flower] blooms there.
　Unlike [the field metaphor], I don't take much care of the flowers themselves.
　　We need to make sure that the underground lake doesn't dry up or the water doesn't get muddy.
　Unlike a farm, we don't expect to have a regular harvest.
　　[I'm lucky if it's in bloom.
　　Around here, I don't make a living writing books, so maybe it's more of a hobby.
