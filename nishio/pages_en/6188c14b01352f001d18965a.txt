Spread or not spread.
[https://gyazo.com/97148e6116f6dc1e9c732c917538e036]

　Those on the left think they "spread" from A to B.
　　In fact, with respect to concrete example c, it is not included in A, but in B
　The range of observation of the right person is different
　　B is not very widespread in this observation range.
　　Especially with respect to specific example d, it is not included in either A or B.
　　Hearing the left person's claim that "it has spread", he takes the liberty of interpreting it as a claim that "d is included in B", and then argues "No, it has not spread, and d is not included in B".
　From the left, "I didn't claim that 'd is included in B'" and "it's [a straw man argument] to criticize what I didn't claim."
　A bird's eye view of the whole picture.
　　Claims of "spread" don't usually mean "spread in all directions."
　　The fact that "some parts have not spread" does not negate the claim that they have "spread."
