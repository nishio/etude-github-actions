 I'll bring my MacBook to work tomorrow.
 
 But even if I do it tomorrow, the weight will be the same tomorrow since I'll be bringing the Thinkpad back today anyway.

 Trigger. When I was organizing my manuscript, I suddenly thought, "Oh, I've written a lot about the object-oriented differences between Java and Python, but I haven't mentioned that Java is limited to single inheritance and Python is OK for multiple inheritance.
