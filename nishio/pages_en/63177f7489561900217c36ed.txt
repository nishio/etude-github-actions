Bloom where you are.
In Japanese, when we say, "Bloom where you are placed," it is unclear who the placing entity is.
The original poem clearly says, "Bloom where God has planted you."
	The author is the theologian [Reinhold Niebuhr - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9B%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E3%83%BB%E3%83%8 B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC]

Some people use this phrase to mean something like "even if you are dissatisfied with the company you joined as a new graduate, stay active in that company," but I think this is a mistake.
	In the original [" God has planted you in a special place. Once you know it, your personality will shine through as you share it with others. We call that "radiance" our "flower."] He writes.
	In other words, this "place" refers to "something special just for you.
		By no means does it mean "a company I happened to graduate from".
	Know it, he says, and it will bloom.
		In Japanese terms, "[knowing] one's destiny" comes close.
		If I were to rephrase it in a modern way, I think it would be closer to "You bloom as you are.
