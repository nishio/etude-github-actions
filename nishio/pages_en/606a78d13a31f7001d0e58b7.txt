Keep bad thought patterns verbalized.
When I am in a [bad thought pattern], I cannot accept it when others point it out to me.
Therefore, it is necessary to verbalize in advance which bad thought patterns are present and to be able to recognize them yourself when you fall into them.

In the future, the program will point it out. It is less emotional than being pointed out by a human.
