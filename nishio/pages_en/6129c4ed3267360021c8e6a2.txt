Manage Kozaneba development in Kozaneba
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1431285498996158474]: I've been trying to manage Kozaneba's development on Kozaneba for a while now, and I've been thinking that reason has decided to "do this next" and put a WIP tag on it. I'm rather ignoring tasks and doing unrelated things. I've got three patterns here, "rational to do next," "ease driven," and "uncertainty reduction move."

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1431286643755864064]: At this point in time, it would be a reasonable move to finish duplicating and deleting the place and call it a day, but it would be fun to figure out how to make a Scrapbox Kozane. But the fun part was figuring out how to make a Scrapbox Kozane, and then realizing that I could read Gyazo as is. The uncertainty reduction move is to verify if the hypothesis is correct after realizing that "Gyazo can be read as it is unexpectedly.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1431286942931456003]: So, even after I found that it can be loaded, I actually tried to make it look like Scrapbox, and even started adjusting the size contrast with regular Kozane... It's completely fun-driven!
