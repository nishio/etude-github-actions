branding
	The most core function is "to move and organize fragments of thoughts", so I brought "moveable".
ã€€Short form movidea

Why reimplement?
	Trial and error results in code complexity, which is an obstacle to adding new features.
	After reading [/shokai/Scrapbox development process], I thought the following ideas were important
		Focus on Impact
  I can't get close to "something that looks like it belongs somewhere."
  Don't add features unnecessarily
  I won't let it bug you.
	 Increasing the amount of code gets in the way of prototyping the next feature.
ã€€Minimal functionality with minimal code

Not to do
 No Canvas
  Free handwritten additions are not implemented.
  Not implementing lasso selection.
  why?
   When we created Regroup, the first thing we tested was whether it was possible to smoothly add handwriting, assuming an iPad + Apple Pencil.
   We found out to what extent it was technically possible (quite possible), but not so much in terms of user needs.
   The realization of this is generating strong technical constraints, so it is better to seal it once and find another way to do it.

To do
 testing a microphone
	Using [styled-components
		Last time it was Canvas, so it was defined in JS as far as style was concerned.
ã€€This time we'll use the DOM, but it's not nice to separate it into CSS.
	[ReactN] + [immer]
  Last time I made it while learning React, I started making it using the built-in useState system.
  ã€€But since it's "an app that puts stickies on a giant whiteboard", the parent App component will have most of the state
   I learned later that [ReactN] was better suited for my purposes.

What's Next

ã€€Cover the verification of the mistake with a test case before implementing the selection move.



Verification.
ã€€Can you make stickies without Canvas?
ã€€ã€€Important technical points
ã€€ã€€ã€€[âœ…Can the font size be adjusted automatically?]
ã€€ã€€ã€€Dragging, well, you can do that.
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€I'm concerned about interference with text selection.
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€Last time I made an experimental sample with hard code, but later I started using that after the [JSON import function] was created, so this time I'll make it first and use it as a test case.
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€Include a version string in the data.
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€1: Make the exported JSON from the current Regroup readable
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€The question of whether the data structure should remain the same as before is not considered now.
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€âœ…[2021-07-14Movidea Development Diary].
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€2: Use it to create test cases
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€3: Data structure changes are easier to make if covered by testing.
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€â†’First [expose ReactN and use it from Cypress

ã€€Can you zoom in and out smoothly?
ã€€ã€€[âœ…Smooth scaling parallelism in DOM]
		[Macbook trackpad scaling parallelism].

ã€€I want to cover the data storage format with thorough testing, since it is hard to notice bugs or lost data when they occur.
ã€€ã€€You can't protect them with a mold.

Last time I made it without testing and started testing with jest-electron in the middle of the process.
ã€€It was difficult to make it testable because it was not designed with testing in mind and it was full of asynchronous processing.
ã€€It ended up not being covered in the test.
ã€€This time [exposing ReactN and using it from Cypress].

Last time it was iPad + Apple Pencil assumption, this time it is MacBook assumption.

Last time, the world coordinate system of the sticky was tightly coupled with that of the device, but I think it's better to separate them.

Group Structure
ã€€Pointer to child element
ã€€Drawing order?
ã€€doorplate
ã€€ã€€This is not a pointer.
ã€€ã€€Not even a child element.
ã€€ã€€Can it be a child element?
ã€€ã€€ã€€You shouldn't.
ã€€ã€€Mere text?
ã€€ã€€ã€€You can renew as many times as you like.
ã€€ã€€ã€€In the menu like edit title
ã€€ã€€ã€€So you should know that this is not your average sticky note.
ã€€ã€€ã€€What to do when it opens
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€It used to be a nameplate sticky, but not this one.
ã€€ã€€ã€€Wouldn't it be nice if it showed up as a "group title?"

ã€€ã€€ã€€What should happen when you dismantle ðŸ¤” this
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€If you don't have a title, just demolish it as is.
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€When there is a title, it is an intellectual product and should not be lost
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€Do you want to make it a sticky note?
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ðŸ¤”When you group it back together again?
ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€How about just selecting stickies and copying and pasting them without making an elaborate UI?
ã€€[folded items are one step larger].
ã€€[What should happen when a compressed sticky is decompressed?]
ã€€ã€€Last time I closed it with a menu from open, and opened it with one click from closed.
ã€€ã€€Let's try to toggle between "default open" and "default close."
ã€€ã€€ã€€Distinguish by borders?

done

âœ…Use normal menu [2021-07-15Movidea Development Diary#60eff1fcaff09e0000c6d303].
 context menu
 ã€€Last time I did [balloon menu].
 ã€€ã€€Is this appropriate?
 ã€€ã€€The menu wording is written horizontally, so the buttons are too long and narrow to be placed side by side
 ã€€ã€€It's better to have a vertically aligned menu like the old context menu.
