I want to write a book in Scrapbox
When [writing] a book in Scrapbox, writing long sentences on a single page kills the advantages of Scrapbox, but if the manuscript is spread over several pages, it is difficult to get the "feel of reading on paper. Therefore, it would be better to write each section on a separate page and then embed it in the table of contents page.

 [# Chapter headings]
 	[# Clause heading X]
  	↑Up with special deco-#.
  	←I want to retrieve and render the contents of the page titled "Section Heading X" in this section.

   Use a Chrome extension to get the whole page, wait until it renders, and then extract the DOM of the body part?
