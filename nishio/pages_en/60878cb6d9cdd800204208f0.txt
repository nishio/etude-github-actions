DX and Agility
>[tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1385826623451111424]: I think I'm starting to understand why I'm so stuck on the word [DX]. I think the word "digital" does not include the word "[agility]", so I feel that the essence of DX, "gaining agility through software that is easy to change", is not understood by people other than software engineers.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385840764366716929]: in low tech companies that can't outsource software, "work hard at [operations]" is more agile than "software updates", so there's no way to get the message across.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1386898398054215681]: In the world, there are "[companies that cannot outsource software]", "companies where the information system department can tinker with software ([in-house outsourcing])", and "companies where each department can tinker with software There are "companies where each department (even non-engineers) can tinker with the software".
 >[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1386898496595193856]: "Was this system created by the Information Systems Department?" No, it was created by us, the members of the Personnel and Labor Relations Department.

 >[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1386899189070667776]: When I see this kind of thing around me, I feel that "companies that can only outsource software changes are slow" is a normal thing, but from the response I've seen on Twitter, it's still not recognized. I'm not sure if it's still recognized by the response on Twitter.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1386901874427580416]: Ah, I see. I wonder if Cybozu's system of "no personnel transfers against the will of the employee" (i.e., supervisors do not have the authority to make transfers) is possible because of the agility provided by the software.

>[tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1386902468089421825]: "IT availability comes and goes" and "there is no place for software talent to move to" was a way of thinking until the 90's. Today, thanks to cloud computing, IT can be deployed anytime and anywhere. Today, thanks to the cloud, it is possible to deploy at any time, IT availability is constant, and software talent can be deployed anywhere.

If each department can do this within their own department, the communication costs associated with in-house outsourcing will be reduced.

  > I see... if the group companies are large and there is a rule that you can only use what is within the group, there will be no free competition in the market, so in-house outsourcing will be slower than regular outsourcing.

>[tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1386909447067369473]: When I hear about Cybozu's HR department building their own system, it reminds me of the story about Facebook hiring programmers for marketing and HR. I don't know how true it is, but it reminds me of the story that Facebook hires programmers for marketing and human resources, otherwise they can't improve their systems.

>[chachay https://twitter.com/chachay/status/1386916686281027586]: In this arrangement, I think the job system is for people who are particular about the format of documents (but the format is well designed and finely updated with high expertise), and the membership system is for people who have a flexible workflow from a broad perspective (which is covered by the operation). I think it's more like a membership system that allows flexible workflow from a broad perspective (covered by operations)....

>[tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/1386918559545057284]: in a world with extremely strong labor unions, no software, no outsourcing or subsidiaries, I think so!
> The reality is that if you want to get promoted or move into another position, you are expected to go beyond the JD, and if your JD is to create software, you are expected to do all the work involved in that.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1386924552073060360]: There are two factions: one is the "membership-based employment plus the right to transfer personnel" approach to multi-skilling, and the other is the "job-based employment plus the right to fire" approach to procuring the necessary skills on the market. Cybozu has introduced a membership-based work style with no personnel transfers where there were two factions, and perhaps IT and information sharing are the way to achieve multi-skilling.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1386925183471013895]: the HR department is multi-skilled to develop the system. And I'm sure the promotion of voluntary internal transfers and [parallel work] is causing multi-skilling without mandatory HR transfers.
