Avoid the errors of your country.
Originally titled "Avoid Your Country's Errors. Some might interpret "[the country's] mistakes" to mean "the country is doing the wrong thing, not you."
Rather, we tend to take "the environment in which we were born and raised" for granted, so we underestimate any shortcomings there. There is no country without flaws.
Not only countries, but also families, status, position, and age have similar "[environmental shortcomings]". All of these "environmental shortcomings" create "[environmental shortcomings]" in a single person, and if not carefully defended against, they create an intolerable monster.

Typical of the current "environmental shortcomings/deficiencies due to the environment" in Japan is the distortion in the future forecast of the world economy: [which countries are driving the world economy today].

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Avoid the errors of your country.

Water shares the goodness or badness of the strata through which it flows, and man shares the goodness or badness of the climate in which he was born. Some owe more to their birthplace than others because of the favorable sky at its zenith. There is no country, even among the most civilized, that is without its own peculiar shortcomings, which other countries condemn for boasting or warning. It is a triumph of cleverness for such a country to correct or conceal its own shortcomings. And the less it is expected, the more it is appreciated. There are also family shortcomings and shortcomings due to position, office, and age. All of these in one person, if not carefully defended, make an intolerable monster.
