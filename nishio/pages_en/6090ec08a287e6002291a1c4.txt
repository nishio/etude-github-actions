 *1318638033* Difference between abduction and induction
 I am not familiar with philosophy, so I did not understand the difference between induction (induction) and abduction. Abduction is "Given observed facts X1, X2, . Xn", and deduction is "to derive X{n+1}, which has not been observed yet, assuming that hypothesis H is correct". What is induction?
 
 For example, some texts give as an example of function the idea that "there is only mint in this box" from the observed fact that "I took one candy out of the box and it was mint, and then I took another one out and it was mint again," but that's forming the hypothesis that "there is only mint in this box." So it's clearly abduction. So is abduction a concept that includes induction?
 
 It is hard to believe that Aristotle did something that an amateur philosopher like me would notice after a little thought, so I reject this hypothesis.
 
 If the conclusion is not "There is only mint in this box," but "If I take out another box, it will still be mint," it can be easily understood. It is easy to confuse between forming a hypothesis by abduction and then deducing it, and directly inducing it, because the input and output data are the same, but in the former, a verbalized hypothesis is created by abduction, while in the latter, a verbalized hypothesis is not created.

 Aristotle understood this triangle and made three classifications, but during the subsequent "period when abduction was forgotten," the combination of abduction and deduction may have also come to be called induction. It can only be because input and output are the same and the concept of formal knowledge was not major.
 
 I think this kind of hypothesis can easily explain it! ï¼žPhilosophy expert

 <body>Hello, according to what I have read, Perth proposed abduction. <BR>Before that, he called induction any method of reasoning other than deduction. The following entry has a quote from that book<br>. <br>http://d.hatena.ne.jp/next49/20100628/p1</body>

 <body>Today. <BR><BR>I wrote what I thought might be an example of abduction in a buzz comment (I wrote it in reference to an example from Ikuo Uozu's book - the example of white beans and bags by Perth). I wrote what I thought might be an example of abduction (I wrote it referring to an example from Ikuo Uozu's book - the example of white beans and bags by Perth). I hope you will find it useful. </body>
