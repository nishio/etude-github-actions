New Seasons
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1473261429369507852]: Now we implicitly assume that "seasons" are "spring, summer, fall, and winter", but it is possible to have a state of "high virus season and low virus season" like "dry season and rainy season". I was talking about this.

But in winter, for example, there are areas where heavy snowfalls make it impossible to get around, and humans should be able to adapt to the situation where "there are seasons to go out and seasons not to go out.
