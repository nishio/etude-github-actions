Side Stud - Clip Bar - Clip
[https://gyazo.com/6fc55b2abd302d8fe28b457610771298]
Pattern of grabbing the [clip bar] that grew from the [side studs] with the [clip].

The clip plate as shown above interferes with the clip on the clip bar, so it is easier to assemble by attaching the clip plate to the clip bar and then sticking it into the side studs.
