Time Resources and Tomato Harvest
 When we talked about capital earlier, you mentioned financial capital, [knowledge capital] and [social capital], but we can't overlook time as a resource that is limited in quantity.
  And time, unlike the other three, can't be stored, so if you don't stay motivated, it's going to hang around for nothing.
  By analogy, time is a perishable vegetable.
  Oh, and if we say tomatoes, it'll connect with [pomodoro].
  That is, counting by the number of time boxes in a pomodoro-like state of concentration.
  There is a limit to the number of tomatoes that can be harvested in a day, and they can't be carried over to tomorrow because they rot in a day.
