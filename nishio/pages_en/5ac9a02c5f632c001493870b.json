Life purpose is created through abstraction of daily tasks.
	They say, "You need to clarify [your life purpose]," not create a new one.
 What do I consider good and what do I want to avoid in my daily routine tasks?
 It is something that is [gradually clarified] by observing it.

[抽象化]：
	You said, "I had choices A and B, and I chose A. Why is that?"
 	Clarify the "part of Option A that you feel is intrinsically valuable" in Option A.
 If it's A and B, you pick A. If it's C and D, you pick C. What do they have in common?"
  Clarify commonalities between the preferred alternatives
 Why not B's and D's?"
 	Clarify what is being interpreted negatively.
