 I'm sleepy, so I'll make it easy.

 We have created a device <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/gasso/20100521">gasso</a> that, when pressed against an iPhone, can take information about which figure it is, which way it is facing, and where it is located. With this device, you can use the figure itself like a game controller by placing it on the iPad and moving it around, create a picture book that changes its story by placing it in a specific location, or have three people each fight with their own character on a map called the iPad. The dreams are expanding!
 
 I'm sleepy, so I'll talk more about it another time when I feel like it.
