(4.3.1.4) ❹ Make questions
[❹ Make questions]

In Paul Scheele's original explanation, step 4 was "[activation]." In this step, he refers to four actions:

	"to [make concrete questions]"
	"to mature"
	"to [find answers]"
	"to make a [mind map]."

I divide this step into step 4 to 7.

First, I explain about making questions. In the step, you make [concrete] questions about the contents of the book. For example, "Activation? What is that?"

The purpose of reading was originally "to [collect information]," and it changes into the more concrete purpose of "find the explanation about what 'activation' is."

Before reading a book, it is important to [clarify the purpose] of reading. However, you need information to [clarify] the [purpose]. It is the "[chicken or the egg]" problem. Especially when you are going to read a book in an unfamiliar area, you do not know what is in the area. You can not make the [perfect] purpose [from the beginning]. You need to collect information to make the purpose [concrete]. You refine the purpose [gradually] after you [collect information].

Let me explain a bit more concretely about what to do in this step.
To make concrete questions, you read the book for about 5 to 15 minutes. [Paul Scheele] calls this action a "[post view]." It is a reading method to quickly look at sentences in large chunks and pick only 2 or 3 sentences which you feel important.

You may want to look for the answer to the question. However, [Paul Scheele] says you should not try to find the answer yet. Instead of looking for the answer to the question here, you concentrate on making questions.
