AI teaches keywords
[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1637306195718582273?s=20]: [search used to be] a human typed "[keyword]". Now [ChatGPT] asks for [description] and creates a sentence with keywords scattered around, thus assisting in the discovery of [keywords]. Now I do the backtracking by doing a [Google search] with the keywords, but soon the machine will do that itself.
I looked it up because [GPT4] said "Fortune has only bangs" was Vergilius, and it looks like "Fate sides with the bold" is correct. The meaning is close, so it's great that you come up with this one.
So, the empty page is now full: [Lucky Goddess has only bangs].

  I think I saw somewhere in the diary, "In the past, searches were done by putting in keywords and the description came up, but ChatGPT can find keywords by putting in a description," something like that[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
  　[AI can teach you words based on their meanings] or something[/villagepump/Haruhi.icon].
  　Thanks! [/villagepump/nishio.icon]
 　　You couldn't find it because you assumed it was a search and put the keyword "search" in the search box...(meta)
