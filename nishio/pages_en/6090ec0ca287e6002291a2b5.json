 *1374588295*I turned 32 years old.
 Wife: "Write down that you're 0x20 years old."
 I said, "Eh, that's too goofy."
 
 
 I have finally reached the age of 0b100000, and once the sixth bit is up, I am no longer considered "young" by the standards of the Young Scientists' Association of Information Science and Technology. As I reach the turning point until the age of 0100, when I can become a young person again, I will continue to do my best in the future.
 
 As for the direction of my efforts, I would like to place more emphasis on the unexpected than ever before.
 
 
 My wife and I have been married for three years now, and nothing much has changed. My wife's education has gradually brought me closer to being a real person, but it seems that two years is not enough at all.
 My wife says, "He's 3 now (we've been dating for a little over 3 years), so I feel like he's finally getting the concept of tidying up. At 43 years of age, he is rebellious, and at 48, he is an adult...it is a long road ahead of him. I would like to continue to devote myself to it.
