I'll just do one line.

	The months-long task of "translation" was "[too] big a task" and was broken up into 25-minute [pomodoros].
	And yet, before you know it, it subconsciously turns into a mistake like "if you want to perform it, you have to do one pomodoro".
	People unconsciously make [tasks] bigger.
	It's easier to put it off under some pretext.
	Pomodoro is also a "means" and "tool", not an "end".
	Remember, the goal is to make the translation go as fast as possible.

	Similar to [if you don't have MP for 25 minutes of magic, just hit 3 minutes of magic], but slightly different.
		This is a "no motivation to start before the work begins" condition
			[work excitement], so "start doing something related" is beneficial.
		In this case, I have a [sense of accomplishment] and [satisfaction] by finishing a task that takes many pomodoros to complete.
			Not to be satisfied with that state of affairs, but to take it one step further.
			Never be satisfied with the status quo.
