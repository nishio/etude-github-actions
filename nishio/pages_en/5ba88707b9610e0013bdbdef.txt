Text extraction from PDF
2022-03-29 3-line summary:.
	$ pip3 install pdf2txt.py
	$ pdf2txt.py -V -o <outfile> <infile>
	I'm thinking of making a new script, so I'll add the details when it's ready.

2018/09/24 1-line summary: clone PDFMiner.six repository, generate CMap, then setup.py install

When I wrote [natural language processing with word2vec] before, I used [PDFMiner https://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/].
I had been using the scripts from that time for mere text extraction, but I wanted to try various new things.
As of 2018, PDFMiner only supports Python 2, so use [PDFMiner.six https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six], which supports 2/3.

summary
	I want to use PDFMiner.six because I want to use it with Python3
 CMap generation is necessary to handle Japanese PDFs
 	I don't know how to generate it when installing with pip, so I clone it from the repository.
  It says to `make cmap`, but it says `make: Nothing to be done for cmap.
  Explicitly hit the command written in the Makefile (below) #CMap re-generated
  	Maybe I could have done make cmap_clean, but I haven't tried it.
	$ python setup.py install
		If you piped it in first, uninstall it.
 $ pdf2txt.py -V -o <outfile> <infile>
Now you get a clean text file.

remarks
	With [pdftotext], which is bundled with [poppler], the conversion appears to be straightforward, but there is an unintuitive disorder in the line order. (Perhaps the confusion is caused by irregular bounding boxes such as footnotes or chapter headings at the end of the page.)

Hmmm, you're embedding CID fonts. [CID issue].

This is what happens with [pdftotext] bundled with [poppler].

It may look good at first glance, but the last line, "No, I don't. Even if I introduce a reference book, I can't convey what I want to convey in the limited time" is a continuation of "I can't convey what I want to convey in the limited time" eight lines above. The sequence of "Kawaki," "Tanjiro's," and "'Idea' Note 2" is also incorrect.

The same ranges are properly aligned in PDFMiner.
> I have tried to communicate. However, in the limited time we have, we cannot convey what we want to say.
