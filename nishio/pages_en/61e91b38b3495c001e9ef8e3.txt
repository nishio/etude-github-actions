(6.2.2.1) Trigger by question
Questions prompt verbalization. This principle made the framework. The framework is a bunch of questions. For example, the "lean startup" suggests filling the following value hypothesis sheet before starting to make a product.

Value hypothesis sheet

By filling in the blanks, you are encouraged to answer a lot of questions, such as:
 "What kind of user is assumed for this product?"
	"What kind of desire does the user have?"
 "What are the challenges to satisfy that desire?"
	" What kind of characteristics of the product will solve the problem?"
