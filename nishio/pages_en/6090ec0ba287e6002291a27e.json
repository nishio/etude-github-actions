 *1356097637* How to Create Hypotheses for Lean Startup
 In case you haven't read "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4822248976/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=running-lean-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative= 7399&creativeASIN=4822248976">Lean Startup</a>" In a nutshell, for those who haven't read it, "Lean Startup" is about "improving products quickly by shortening the cycle to test hypotheses.
 
 There are many explanations on how to test a hypothesis. But how do you create a "hypothesis"? We have organized how to create a hypothesis.
 
 ** Q1: Have you ever experienced something different from what you expected?
 →Is it a failure? Success?
 
 →What caused it to fail?
 
 (Note: If you blame others or the economy, etc., which you cannot control, your thinking will stop there. It is important to attribute as much as possible to things you can control.)
 
 →How did you make the most of it?
 
 →If you are not making use of them, why are you not making use of them?
 
 ** Q2: Have you ever felt a discrepancy between your ideal and reality?
 
 (It should be this way, but in fact it is not! I feel like I should be doing this, but in fact I am not!)
 
 → When comparing Ideal A to Reality B, what is the advantage of Reality B over Ideal A?
 
 (If A is superior in everyone's eyes, it should change to A. In reality, reality B must have some advantages. What is it? Can't we have a good point?)
 
 →(You are making good products, but customers do not appreciate them.) Isn't there a gap between the value that customers want and the value that you think they want? Have you observed what customers want?
 
 ** Q3: Have you ever felt that something was missing?
 
 →What is missing?
 
 →What is it that you don't understand?
 
 →What is the most worrisome task?
 
 ** Finally
 
 This "summary" is being developed and released as a "minimum practical product" in the Lean Startup sense, with a time investment of 1 pomodoro (25 minutes). If there seems to be demand for it, we would like to improve it.

 *1356100546* Clarify the purpose of reading the book.
 Clarity of purpose is more efficient than proceeding without clarity.
 
 That being said, I think I often have trouble understanding "how to clarify".
 So I organized a list of questions about the purpose of the task of "reading a book".
 
 ** Q: Is reading that book a pastime?
 
 For example, in the case of reading science fiction novels or comic books, I think we often read them for entertainment.
 If it's entertainment, you don't need to be efficient. The goal is to have fun, so read in a way that you enjoy.
 
 
 ** Q: Is the book something you want to read?
 
 For example, there are many cases in which "I have to read" is stronger than "I want to read," such as meeting materials that must be read, assigned books for writing reports at school, textbooks, and so on. It is important to know whether you "want to read" spontaneously or not.
 
 
 ** Q: What do we need to know (if it's a book we have to read)?
 
 What is ~?" The vague task of "reading a book" is transformed into a clear task of "researching 'what is ~'" by verbalizing questions such as "What is ~?
 
 For example, not many people read a dictionary from the beginning, and even if they try, they usually lose heart quickly (according to the author's experience). However, there are not many people who say they have never used a dictionary profitably. The reason is that when they read a dictionary, they have a clear goal "to look up 'what is'" and the task ends when that goal is achieved.
 
 In the same way, reading a book you don't want to read off the top of your head breaks your heart, but it is less likely to break when you are picking up and reading to achieve a clear goal.
 
 ** Q: (If it's a book you want to read) Why do you want to read it?
 
 Let's verbalize the reasons.
 
 
 ** Q: (I want to understand the book!) For what?
 
 If it is because understanding itself is fun, then this is entertainment.
 
 If not, there must be another purpose. What is it?
 
 
 → (I want to be able to do ~ specifically!) Then you can measure whether you have understood it or not by whether you can do it or not. If you are losing heart in the middle of this pattern, "I want to be able to do ~" is probably aiming for something too big from the start. You have to start with a smaller goal and gradually achieve it. Even the bravest of men start out with slime.
 
 
 → (Because it might be useful to know...) If you think so, and then you have a stack of books without any motivation to read them, you are not that convinced by the idea that "it might be useful". The more you pay the cost of knowing, the less attractive the state of affairs after knowing looks, so you lose motivation.
 
 
 ** Q: Shouldn't you stop reading that book?
 
 →(Well...)
 
 →(No, learning the content of this book is worth the time! I just don't have the motivation!)
 
 
 ** Q: How about more detailed tasks?
 
 I'm not motivated to read or learn because it's "a task that could take hours to accomplish"?
 If so, why not do a smaller task that can be done in about 30 minutes?
 
 If you have not even opened the book yet, first read only the cover, table of contents, and chapter titles to figure out what the book is explaining and where it is written.
 
 If you have already done so much as flip through the book, you could do "Let's make a notebook of the most important parts of this book" or "Let's blog about the most important parts of this book".
