 *1299595019*Successive Pomodoro
 I did as I was foolishly told by Pomodoro, "Move the number of Pomodoros you think you can do in a day from your task inventory list to your 'to do today' list." day 2. One thing I learned.
 
 When you have a task list full of things to do, you may be thinking, "Which one should I do first? And if task A is not urgent and you don't feel like doing it, you put it off until tomorrow, and tomorrow, and so on. Because there are plenty of other tasks to do.
 
 But when I put it on my "to do list today," after doing them in order from the ones I wanted to do, there's one left at the end that I don't feel like doing, and yet it's the only one left on my "to do list today. I've put Task B, the "Oh, I have to do this too" task derived from the task I did earlier, on my inventory list to do tomorrow because it's not urgent. I think this is the important part. Task A and Task B are equally important, not urgent. So in my past task management, I would do the newly emerged task B first. Then task A would remain on the task list for days and days, and begin to emit a foul smell. The fact that I keep putting off starting the task makes the task look boring.
 
 I had no choice but to start Task A because it was the only thing left on my "to-do list today," but when I started it, I found it to be interesting in its own way. Even if the task itself is not interesting, it is a challenge to see if I can finish a task that I estimate I can do in 25 minutes in 25 minutes! Challenge! It can be played as a "game. In this way, even if the task is uninteresting, one pomodoro minute is steadily solved every day.
