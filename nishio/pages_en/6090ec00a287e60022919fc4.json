 *1246755732* Sunday Diary
 Ummm, my back hurts...
 
 I got an email that vivipri shipped on Thursday, but I haven't received it, so I'm sure it will come on Monday.
 
 hungry
 
 I'm hungry.
 
 Let's go to Kinshicho by bicycle. I'll buy a light at Veggie at Subway on the way.
 
 I came to Yodobashi to withdraw money. It's crowded. 1204
 
 
 I got 32 gigs of black, about 70,000.
 
 
 I went there after reading the article on Rabakyu, so it was smooth. I will link to it later.

 Bought 1306
 
 how to input Japanese? from iPhone

 <<
 I decided to pay in a lump sum because this is what it seems to mean. I bought it with cash because it is 10% for cash and 8% for credit card.
 
 And this: <a href='http://labaq.com/archives/51212551.html'>RabaQ: New notes and additional information I learned after pre-ordering the new iPhone 3G S</a>.
 
 If I had not known in advance that "subscription to the W-White option is mandatory," I would have spent a lot of time on site saying, "Oh, why is that? Since I knew that, I could have simply said, "You must subscribe to the W-White option," "Yes, you can cancel that right away, can't you?
 
 In my case, the explanation was, "We don't provide copying service at the store, you have to use your own PC for copying.

 *1246785687* Playing with the iPhone Camera
 When I first learned about the iPhone camera about a year ago, I thought it would be a lot of fun, and now that I finally have an iPhone of my own, I've been playing with it and taking all kinds of pictures.
