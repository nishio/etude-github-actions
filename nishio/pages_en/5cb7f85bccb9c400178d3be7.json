local optimum
	The entire production process is interconnected and influences each other [system].
	Looking at just one part of it and making improvements will not improve the overall performance.
		Splitting and optimizing doesn't make sense.
  Denial of [divide and conquer].
	We need to identify [bottlenecks] and work on them.
	[Goldratt] thought that all [systems] would need to do the same.
		This is [an overgeneralization].
	The production process of physical things is [DAG] because of physical constraints, but the general system is not.
