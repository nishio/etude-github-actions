Avoid issues of honor.
The first half is not clear.
[If you have one fool, you can avoid having a second one]. That's a good way to use [fools].

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Avoid issues of honor.
xlvii Avoid "issues of honor."

Avoiding the "question of honor" - one of the most important purposes of prudence. In a person of great ability, the extremes are so far apart that there is a long distance between them, a middle ground of constant attention, that it takes time to break through. These situations are easier to avoid than to work through. They are a test of our judgment, and it is better to avoid them than to conquer in them. One incident of honor may lead to another incident of dishonor. Some men are easily made, by nature or by state, to assume such duties. But for those who walk by the light of reason, such matters require long contemplation. The courage it takes to tackle this problem is more often not to tackle it than to overcome it. If one fool is prepared to take his place, he can escape being the second.
