Crockian period
The days of using a croquis book for [mind mapping]. Started in [2011].

Because it is inconvenient to carry them around, they are placed both at home and at work, causing the problem of "I thought it was written here, but it was over there" (violation of the "one pocket principle").
I discussed this issue with my wife, and the result was [the Moleskine phase]. I decided to use a large A4 size Moleskine because the spread would be A3.
