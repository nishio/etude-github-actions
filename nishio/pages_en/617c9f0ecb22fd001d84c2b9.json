Instead of speaking to many, speak to one and let the many hear you.
There was a classic that said, "Don't try to speak to many people, but speak to one person and let the many listen.

ã€€(Nishio's translation) A good person talks [to one person], even if there are many people. And others naturally listen to it.

>[ysaito8015 https://twitter.com/ysaito8015/status/1454170410040320001]: [Tsurezuregusa], paragraph 54...? / The story of a good person is told by many people, but only when it is said to one person is it heard by the people themselves. But if a good person comes out from among many people and tells a story as if they could see it, they will all laugh at him and laugh at him.

modern translation
>If you are a person of character, even if you are speaking to one person in a crowd, even the people around you will listen. Those who are not a person of character, with their guts on display, will interrupt and make up a story as if they had just seen it. It is noisy and annoying when everyone is laughing along with them.
