 *1228658878* left eye itchy
 My left eye is itchy, I thought it might be an inverted eyelash, but it only itches when I go outside. I've been thinking that I've been sneezing lately...is this hay fever? What is pollen in this season? Or am I allergic to something else instead of pollen? Why only my left eye itches is a mystery.
 
 *1228659026*Eat triangle for engineers
 Failure is the staple food, "I SUGEE" is the side dish, and the announcement is the miso soup. Triangular food is important.

 <body>"No!" and "I SUGEE" are both subjective, so sometimes miso soup is needed to avoid being too much on one side. </body>
