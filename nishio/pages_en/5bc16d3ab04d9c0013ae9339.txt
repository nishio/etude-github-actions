Flow and Stock
[Flow" and "stock" refer to whether most information is "referenced only once" and "flows away" or whether it is organized, maintained, and "referenced repeatedly. [The "synchronous and asynchronous" cutoff is highly correlated, but not equal.

	Where information is referenced only once and flows away.
	A place where information is repeatedly referenced and organized

	Chat, a place for [synchronous communication], is a typical flow
 	But [asynchronous] mail flows pretty well, too.
  	Most tools do not have [permalinks] that can be shared with others for past emails.
   No permalinks, so you can't [point] to a past email and say "I told you in this email".
	[Scrapbox] is a tool that can be used synchronously, but is very much a stocking place

	Stock is [time transcendent].
