　Thoughts.
　　Think only about the difference D=A-B since all you care about is the final score difference
　　If the back hand does not interfere, the first player wants to take ceil(N/2) pieces from the larger side of D.
　　The back hand naturally gets in the way. The biggest hindrance to the first hand is the biggest D
　　Therefore, the correct answer is the one taken alternately from the one with the largest D.
　Official Explanation
　　careless mistake
　　 >D=A-B
  The difference between those scores would be A+B.
