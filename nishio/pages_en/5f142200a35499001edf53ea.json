Listen to the problem, not the solution.
Commentary by David Rusenko
	Asking users "[what features do you want]" or "[what do you want]" is meaningless because they won't know if they want it or not until they see the actual product
	If a user suggests that a feature like this would be nice, dig into the "what [errand] they want to accomplish" behind the statement!
