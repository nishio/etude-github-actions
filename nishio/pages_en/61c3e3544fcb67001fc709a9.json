Strategy Room Excavation LOG
　Once made a map titled "Strategy Room" with plastic sheets and sticky notes (date unknown).
　I was probably trying to get rid of that thing on the wall when I moved out of the office.
　　Described in Moleskine on 2016-02-07.
　　He had once tucked a bundle of sticky notes into his notebook, but they were bulging and in the way, so he moved them somewhere else.
　　I've lost track of where I moved to.
　　There is a partial copy.
　　You didn't take any pictures? You didn't take any pictures (why...)
　I did a cross search of Scrapbox and got a hit on the home organization memo.

     	What was [the strategic map]?
     	Did you bundle up on the move?

			[20180408Note on task abstraction sticky] Is this it?
			code::
			 Not completed, so more to come #TODO
    And an explanation of "task abstraction" itself #TODO

　　　There were!

　Conclusion.
　　Sticky note was at home folded and partially transcribed to Scrapbox, but the link to it was not clear
　　Every two to three years, the need to refer to it comes up.

Why "Room"?
　Mind Palace Metaphor
　There is a room where things related to long-term strategy are placed.
　　You don't have to be there all the time.
　　　?
　　　Before the physical office move, it was on the wall.
　　I go into that room every few years.
　　　This time I had trouble finding the key to get in.
　[room metaphor].
　The process of generating a "strategy room."
　　[Clean Space Experience] p.34-
　　　In the process of researching the idea that "Sokutsugi is not good for Atari," I found that the process of generating this idea was described in [Clean Space Experience], and when I reread it, I found that this was the process of generating the "strategy room" itself.
