squat
2021-06-23
A while ago I finally got to do one [full squat] without touching anything.
　A full squat here means
　　Spread your feet shoulder-width apart.
　　Knees no further than the toes
　　Arms folded in front of you
　　Keep your heels on the ground.
　　Lower your hips to the bottom.
　Contrary to my initial image, it was not leg strength that caused my inability to squat.
　　Range of motion of the hip joint
　　Ankle range of motion
