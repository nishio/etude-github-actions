Hardworking and intelligent
It's titled "diligent and intelligent," but in Japanese proverb, it's a "[hurry up and get around]" kind of story.
He mentions that "[haste is the fault of fools]" and "[wise men] fail because they procrastinate," then tells us to "hurry slowly."

[It also fits with the idea that "good and slow are better than good and fast.

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Be diligent and intelligent.
53

Diligence performs promptly what the intellect excites slowly. Haste is the fault of fools. They start on a task without knowing the crucial points and without preparation. The wise, on the other hand, often fail because they procrastinate. Foresight begets deliberation, and rash actions often invalidate quick decisions. Promptness is the mother of good fortune. He who leaves nothing until tomorrow is one who has accomplished much. [Slow and hasty" ("Festina lente") is the motto of the royal family.
