　I used to use a rotating head electric toothbrush in the shape of an A
　　But my dentist pointed out that I'm not doing a very good job of cleaning out my periodontal pockets.
　　I talked to my wife and she recommended TePe.
　TePe Supreme has tapered hairs that protrude about 3 mm
　　This cleans between the teeth and into the periodontal pockets.
