Flask to HTTPS
There are cases where you want HTTPS to speak to the development at hand.
I looked up how to do it.
During local development, [webpack-dev-server] was also HTTP, so it was an afterthought.
(I was too quick to assume that the error was due to another cause.)

$ openssl genrsa -aes128 1024 > server.key
$ openssl req -new -key server.key > server.csr
CSR: Certificate Signing Request
$ openssl x509 -in server.csr -days 365 -req -signkey server.key > server.crt
CRT: Certificate
$ flask run --cert server.crt --key server.key
code:: 
  * Serving Flask app "server" (lazy loading)
  * Environment: development
  * Debug mode: on
  * Running on https://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  * Restarting with stat
  * Debugger is active!
  * Debugger PIN: xxx-xxx-xxx
 Enter PEM pass phrase:
I can make it HTTPS with this, but it seems better to make it without passphrase, because I'm asked for passphrase every time I auto-restart after editing the code, I'll try it next time I need it.
