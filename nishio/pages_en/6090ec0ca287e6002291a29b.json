 *1363000476* Algorithm for graph recommendations
 I wrote an explanation of the algorithm for the graph recommendation feature in our product on the company blog: <a href='http://developer.cybozu.co.jp/tech/?p=3874'>Behind "Recommended Graphs" | Cybozu Inside Out | Cybozu Engineer's Blog</a>. I tried to explain it as clearly as possible without giving mathematical formulas. If there is demand, I may write a version with formulas.
