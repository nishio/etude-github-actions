 *1192160611* I want Hatsune Miku to sing a demented song.
 Because they chose only wild songs like Gandara and Devil Man songs, the low gender factor kinky voice doesn't suit them, and they ended up with a high gender factor sissy voice, which doesn't make the most of Hatsune Miku's stupidity. The music selection here should be more dim-witted.

 Development in Django Shiawase
 I love it when I get scolded.
 Traceback is soooo tight!
 You can see local variables!
 Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.

 I thought it was an eroge song, but I found it on YouTube.
 
 *1192190722* If I were to write a song for Turbogears.
 
 When four hearts are united, one ideal has a million powers!
 
 I know, right? <a href="http://www.jtw.zaq.ne.jp/animesong/ke/gettar/gettar.html">Getter Robot! </a>
 
 Django is wonderful. After all, it has two syllables.
 Turbo Gears is hard to put in lyrics.
 With these lyrics, it's like, "â™ª Did you see it, the weirdness, the turbo gears?"
 
 *1192194013* Weekend
 
 I need to work hard this weekend and write a Jython book. Not much progress.
 But thanks to my hard work, Jython is now Japanese compatible. All I have to do now is to donate the Japanese codec I wrote. I'll do my best this weekend.
 
 *1192208323* Miku
 
 I found that I could make a one-minute dialogue plus a song in about 90 minutes.
