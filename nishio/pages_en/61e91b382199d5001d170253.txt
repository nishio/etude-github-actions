(5.2.2) Record anything you think
You may be stimulated by looking at the pieces you wrote before, and come up with a new thought. (*16) Record anything you get. Even if it seems unrelated to the theme, record it. You may find a relationship later. If you do not record it, soon you forget it. (*17) You can add pieces at any time, including the phases after this.

Footnotes:

 (*16) Especially in the case of time-distributed writing, it happens frequently. For example,:
  "Oh, one month ago I was thinking this way. It's a little different from now."
  "Oh, I wrote similar content multiple times. It should be important."
	It is an interaction with yourself in the past. It is a discussion over time.

	(*17) 
		For example, we come up with something about another project. Sometimes we recall the task to be done today. I write it as a new piece and put it on the corner of the desk. It is related to the technique called "[parking lot]." Conference facilitators often use it when dealing with remarks away from the agenda.
		By writing it, we feel relieved. You don't have to use your brain to remember it. You can use 100% of your brain for the theme you want to organize now.
