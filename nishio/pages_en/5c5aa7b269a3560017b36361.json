Group stickies without categorizing them
	In the KJ method, you group stickies." "You classify stickies?" "No, I don't classify them, I group them." "What?"
	It is not communicated that [classification] and [grouping] are used to mean completely different things.
	Commentary by Jiro Kawakita: [Do not classify].
	Maybe we should dare to designate "classification" and "grouping" as NG words to find new words.
	Classification:
		Assume an existing [framework], [framework], [four quadrants], [axis], etc., "[structure]" and place stickies according to that assumption
 Grouping:
 	Without assuming any structure, find "[possibly related pairs]" among the sticky notes and place them nearby.
 	Repeat this process to create a "group of stickies that seem to be related to each other.
 	Work [to create structure] based on sticky note relationships

	Assuming structure" is contraindicated in the KJ method.
		The KJ method is intended to [discover new structures
		"Assume a structure" is "[assume a structure]."
		Assigning a structure and placing stickies according to that structure does not create a new structure.

Specifics.
	'I've put together a sticky with my experiences in running a dating agency. I am going to divide these into male, female, and other perspectives." "No, you can't. Please look at those lined up stickies and pick the one pair that you think has the strongest relationship."
