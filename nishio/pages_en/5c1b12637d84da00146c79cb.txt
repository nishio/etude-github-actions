Spontaneity and Involvement
We often say that [spontaneity] is important, but that doesn't mean it's not good to take actions that are not spontaneous.

A good percentage of what I do is initiated by [being involved in].

I think there might be some better choice of words.
This is my [unresolved issue].

If you get caught up in something and you take it all on, there's no spontaneity.
If you are "saying [no]" to some after making a selection, is it "getting involved" = "[proactive undertaking]"?

I casually used [initiative] and [spontaneity] above without making a very clear distinction, but perhaps we should make a proper distinction between the two.
It's not like "spontaneous" because it's a case of picking and choosing and getting involved, and the trigger is generated by others, but it's "proactive" because it's my decision to participate or not.
