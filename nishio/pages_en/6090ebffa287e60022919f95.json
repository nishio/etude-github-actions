 I think we were able to show that the bureaucracy, not just the IPA, has an image of being hard-headed, but that it is soft-headed enough to come up with the option of creating a Twitter account and carry it out.
 
 
 I heard that the deadline for the first half of the year for the Unexplored Project is the day after tomorrow. Well, even if you can't make it for this one, there are still many more openings.

 Life is a God-given game.
 
 Enemies are balanced so that they are just barely beatable if you really try hard. The experience value system that allows you to improve your efficiency by using your ingenuity, even though simple work is inefficient. The tension of not being able to reset the game. But you don't need to worry too much because it's much harder to die than Siren. Reset is a bad idea even in normal games.
 All characters appear with deep humanity and history, an overwhelming reality.
 The graphics are too beautiful. They are probably running at infinite frames per second with infinite x infinite pixels. Maybe infinite colors can be used. The sunsets are really beautiful.
 Almost infinite variety of background music. Free song selection. You can also play your own music.

 You're not ready to throw it away when you've just been able to participate in such a divine game.

 4: Wasn't the pixel length and frame rate determined by Planck's constant?

 Hey, hey 4, don't make me laugh!
