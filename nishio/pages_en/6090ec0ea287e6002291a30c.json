 *1417614613* HTTPS is faster than HTTP? That's because it's SPDY!
 <a href='https://www.httpvshttps.com/'>HTTP vs HTTPS Test &#8212; Does encryption make websites slower or faster? I saw on Facebook that HTTPS is faster than HTTP, why? I tried it on Chrome, and it is indeed faster. Why?
 
 SPDY. References: <a href='http://www.iij.ad.jp/company/development/tech/activities/spdy/'>SPDY and HTTP/2.0 standardization for faster web display | Latest Technologies and Initiatives | IIJ</a>.
 
 You can check if SPDY is used <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spdy-indicator/mpbpobfflnpcgagjijhmgnchggcjblin/related?hl= en'>SPDY indicator - Chrome Web Store</a> I installed and tried it and got the message "SPDY 3.1 is used".
 
 When I looked at chrome://net-internals/#spdy I saw the following: Force SPDY Always to true or SPDY Enabled to false to make the conditions the same for comparison, but I couldn't figure out how to set it up.
 >||
 SPDY Enabled: true
 Use Alternate Protocol: true
 Force SPDY Always: false
 Force SPDY Over SSL: true
 ||<
 
 Fortunately, I had "IE11 for Windows 7 which does not support SPDY" at hand, so I tried it here and it said "Oops. Your browser is outdated and cannot provide accurate test results. Please install the latest version of your favorite browser. Please install the latest version of your favorite browser." When I ignored it and ran the test, there was no significant difference in speed between HTTP and HTTPS.
 
 In short, this benchmark is not comparing HTTP and HTTPS, but rather SPDY without SPDY and SPDY with SPDY. It is not sincere if you don't specify that.
 
 
 
 After writing this much, I checked the site that mentions this site and found <a href='http://gigazine.net/news/20141202-http-vs-https/'>"HTTPS(SPDY)" or "HTTP" to experience which can connect faster, "HTTPS vs HTTPS Test" - GIGAZINE</a>. HTTP vs HTTPS Test" - GIGAZINE</a> was found, and it turns out that at this point, the HTTPS button says "HTTPS(SPDY)". At this time it is not written. Why .......
