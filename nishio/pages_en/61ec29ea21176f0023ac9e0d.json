[Understanding the System] and [Understanding the User]
　　Understanding of what kind of [pain points] various users in the world are facing.
　　Understanding of "how the system is designed."
　　Users may make misguided requests because they don't understand the system, but the creator may also make misguided designs because they don't understand the pain points of all users.
　　That's why it's important for the creator to observe [users' honest reactions].
　　　Ego search as a means to that end.
　　　　Is it? (conclusion for now anyway)
　　作り手自身がユーザーになることも大事[/villagepump/yosider.icon][/villagepump/kuuote.icon][/villagepump/nishio.icon][/villagepump/takker.icon]
