 I'm almost in tears because of my own gdgd situation.

 I was told that a work system called
 Maybe I should not say, "I'm going to finish my work as soon as I can..." but instead go home after 8 hours and use the time I have left to write.
 I may do so tomorrow.

 I see. You said that the same content is used for benchmarking, taking advantage of the fact that it is used in different languages.
 And because it is CC, it is perfectly acceptable to reproduce the code used for benchmarking.

 Tomorrow, I will discontinue my activities at the lab after 9 hours (8 hours + 1 hour break) from the time I arrive at work. I will go to Cafe Renoir <a href="http://www.ginza-renoir.co.jp/renoir/010.htm">Akasaka Mitsuke</a> and write until 23:00. No matter how hard I concentrate, I can rest assured that I won't accidentally miss the last train.
 
 *1192352899*I'd like to say a few words about Second Life.
 First, open this page and see what year it is and the screenshots. You can read the whole text if you feel like it, or you can search for "NHK" and just read there.

 Then look at the screenshot of this page a year later.

 If I remember correctly, I had been working with Python for about six months at the time. We had a disagreement about why octopuses fly, so I wrote a script in Python to simulate string tension and aerodynamic drag and experimented with it, and I learned an interesting story about "Breitenberg's car," so I added a lot of it to the world so that it would evolve (I think it was about 8 frames per second). It was indeed very heavy, and I think it got down to about 8 frames per second).
 
 It was a very enjoyable year.
 
 It makes me sad when I see people trying to make Second Life popular and DISing that avatars are no good because they are not popular with the Japanese. There was a domestic software that can be scripted in Python and extended with a few dozen frames per second on a 6-7 year old machine with avatars made by Japanese modelers using Japanese origin hexagonal Daioh and metasequoia, 6 years ago.
 
 I've been through that with all my might, and now I'm wondering if it's time for a second life in a foreign country.
 
 There was a discussion about Mr. Sasada's award, asking if it is possible to create a state where Mr. Sasada can devote himself to Ruby development at government expense, but at least the unexplored is no longer possible. When this project was underway, the rule "the same organization can be employed no more than twice" should have been established, making it impossible to continue after the third year. After all, there is no mechanism that can continuously pay for "a project that is not immediately profitable but interesting.
 I don't know how much it costs to promote Second Life, but if we had 100 million, we could have continued this project over here for 3-4 years.
 
 I feel like it's a waste, or a thing, or an uncluttered, hazy feeling. When I look at Second Life.

 I wondered what it was, but it was "Toranoana".

 I think I'll buy a massager.
 
 *1192371965*The Way Home
 Somewhere on the way home, there must be a gas that is blowing out that is making my brain go crazy. The one that was in Delphoi.

 The first part of the "みっかん(みかん)" sounds like "Mikkanku no surimasu- let's put it on gohan (rice cake)".

 <body>Just to be clear, Second Life itself has been around since 2003, and at first it was a flop. It started to gain popularity when they started exchanging money for real money. So, although the starting point was the same, the rise in popularity since then can be attributed to a difference in strategy. I heard that the idea itself has been around since the 1990s. </body
