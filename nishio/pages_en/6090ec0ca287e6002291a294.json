 *1360330738*English for messages in JDK7 (-J-Duser.language=en)
 I've found many blogs that say "env LC_ALL=en javac" will make it English, but that doesn't make any difference. I remember that I used to be able to do this with LC_ALL=en, but it seems that since JDK7, it has been doing some extra work, like looking at the OS language settings. It seems that to force output of messages in English, you can specify javac -J-Duser.language=en or java -Duser.language=en.

 $ javac Nothing.java
 javac: ????????????: Nothing.java
 ????: javac <options> <source files>
 ????????????????????-help??????
 
 $ javac -J-Duser.language=en Nothing.java
 javac: file not found: Nothing.java
 Usage: javac <options> <source files>
 use -help for a list of possible options

 If you're going to be nosy, why don't you just look at the encoding of the console and make it out so it doesn't turn up?
