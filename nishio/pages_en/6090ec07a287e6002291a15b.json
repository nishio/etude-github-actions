 >>
 The probability of thyroid gland disease increases significantly with age up to 20 years, depending on the radiation dose (2), The lifetime risk of thyroid or thyroid gland disease disappears and is no longer considered to be an effect of radiation (2).
 <<
 
 They don't have to worry about anyone over 40.
 
 >>
 In healthy adults, urinary excretion of stable iodine is maximal within 1 to 2 hours of taking a dose. Thereafter, urinary iodine excretion decreases gradually with time, and by 72 hours, almost all of the iodine is eliminated from the body.
 <<
 
 >>
 If taken within 8 hours, it is expected to have an inhibitory effect of about 40% (34). However, if taken after 24 hours, the effect is reported to be about 7% (34).
 <<
 
 It doesn't seem to help much if you take it after the bombing, once a day, though:)
 
 >>
 If you have to consider taking stable iodine on the second day, evacuation should be a priority.
 <<
 
 That seems to be what they mean.
 
 >>
 - When making a decision regarding the use of stable iodine tablets, the benefits and disadvantages of taking them should be fully considered.
 - Consideration should be given to the possibility of adverse reactions when large doses or prolonged continuous use of stable iodine are used.
 - Persons who are at risk of serious or life-threatening side effects from taking stable iodine should not be allowed to take stable iodine tablets.
 - The use of stable iodine in newborns and fetuses in the second trimester of pregnancy may adversely affect the development of intelligence in the future, so care should be taken to avoid high doses or prolonged use of stable iodine. The following is a brief summary of the information on the subject.
 <<
 
 He said that there are some side effects, so children and pregnant women in particular need to be careful.
 
 >>
 The recommended iodine doses in WHO and many other countries (Ref. I) are 12.5 mg for newborns, 25 mg for children aged 1 month to less than 3 years, 50 mg for children aged 3 years to less than 13 years, and 100 mg for children aged 13 years to less than 40 years.
 
 The dosage for subjects in my country is (omitted) 76 mg of iodine for those aged 13 to 40 years. WHO recommends 100 mg of iodine for subjects between the ages of 13 and 40 years, or a single dose of at least 30 mg of potassium iodide for an adult should be sufficient to suppress the accumulation of radioiodine in the thyroid gland (34). (34), (2) that the pharmaceutical potassium iodide pills currently being prepared by local authorities contain 38 mg of iodine per pill and can be taken easily and quickly (hereinafter abbreviated).
 <<
 I heard that.
 
 I am of course not an expert, and I make no guarantees about your future, so you have to decide what to do at your own risk after listening to my opinion! My opinion about people who say "I have to drink isodine because it's radioactive!
 - If you're confusing isodine with potassium iodide, you're an idiot, and if you know what you're talking about and you're arguing that it might work because it contains iodine, well, be my guest, because there's no experiment to negate that.
 - If it's over 40, it's just stupid because it's never effective in the first place.
 - If you haven't grasped the whole "you need to keep drinking because your body will be out of it in two days" thing, then you're an idiot.
 - If you don't understand how much to drink, you're an idiot.
 - If you are trying to give it to children or pregnant women, don't do it because it can cause intellectual disability!
 - What's all the fuss about living in Tokyo, which is more than 10 times farther away than the radius where the evacuation order was issued in the first place?
 That seems to be the case. Well, of course, if drinking isodine makes you feel happy and immune to radiation, you can drink it. In that case, it would be better to dilute the isodine as thinly as possible, so that the ratio of disadvantages to advantages will be better.
 
 **Rotating power outages
 
 <a href='http://www.tepco.co.jp/cc/press/11031225-j.html'>Press Release 2011｜TEPCO News｜TEPCO</a> Impact of the Tohoku - Pacific Ocean Earthquake on TEPCO Facilities [as of 5:00 pm] March 2011 March 12, 2011
 
 All the news is about nuclear power plants, but quite a few thermal and hydroelectric plants are also shut down. I wonder how long it will take these guys to get back up and running, and how much power they were supplying...
 
 <a href='http://www.tepco.co.jp/cc/press/11031217-j.html'>March 12, 2011: Possible power outage due to tight supply and demand and request for further power conservation</a>, supply 36 million kW, demand 37 million kW, 1 million kW short. The <a href='http://www.tepco.co.jp/cc/press/11031227-j.html'>Avoidance of rolling blackouts due to tight supply-demand situation</a> seems to avoid the possibility of power outages? But how is UFR going to be a drastic solution to the supply shortage? It won't, will it? If we were discussing such things as:.
 
 <a href="http://s.nikkei.com/g1xnUc">TEPCO, rotating blackouts from 14th "will last at least a week" Nikkei Shimbun 3/12 20:21 / Nikkei</a>.
 >>
 At the press conference, Executive Vice President Takashi Fujimoto stated, "Demand for electricity is expected to be 41 million kilowatts on the 14th, while supply will be about 31 million kilowatts, a shortfall of about 10 million kilowatts. The duration and scale of the rolling blackouts have not yet been determined, but "they will probably last at least a week. The scale will be about 5 to 10 million kilowatts," he said.
 <<
 
 I knew it wasn't a drastic solution......................1/4 of the demand is not enough.... And somehow the supply is decreasing. I wonder if it can't be flexible because other areas need electricity on weekdays. So I wonder if the "rotating blackouts on weekdays" will continue for the time being until the power plants resume operation and supply is sufficient. We need to think about how we will work assuming that there will be no electricity for a percentage of the weekday business hours.
 
 By the way, TEPCO's press release site tends to be updated later than those of Nikkei and Sankei, so when I go to the press release after reading the news, there is nothing there! I often go to the press release after reading the news and find nothing there! I wonder if they are understaffed.

 <a href='http://ideaction.ldblog.jp/archives/4204207.html'>Lists things to prepare for before a planned power outage. Summary / Spread the word] #jishin #84MA #prayforjapan #jisin : Idea Action <Idea Action ⇔ Action Power></a> Good summary, but dropping breakers is not necessary for this planned power outage as it is to prevent short circuits and ignition due to faulty outlets etc. In my opinion.
 
 ** During power outage
 - Odakyu <a href='http://www.odakyu.jp/'>Odakyu Electric Railway</a>
 >>
 The operation of the limited express Romance Car will be suspended for the time being, and some lights in the station will be turned off and the elevators and escalators will be shut down. The number of trains in operation may be reduced or drastically reduced due to the expected difficulties in securing the necessary power to operate the trains.
 <<
 
 -<a href='http://www.keio.co.jp/news/update/announce/nr110313v01/index.html'>Notices｜Keio Group</a>.
 >>
 On Monday, March 14, the Keio and Inokashira Lines will operate approximately 50% of their normal frequency throughout the day.
 In addition, from 9:00 to 13:30 and from 18:00 to 22:00,
 The service is completely suspended west of Chofu (between Chofu and Keio-Hachioji/Takaoyamaguchi and between Chofu and Hashimoto).
 <<
 This is going to be tough to leave...
 
 -JR and others <a href='http://sankei.jp.msn.com/life/news/110314/trd11031400220000-n1.htm'>[rotating blackouts] Private railways in the Tokyo metropolitan area will reduce the number of trains, Keio by 50% - MSN Sankei News</a>.
 >>
 JR Yamanote and Chuo lines are expected to operate normally. For other conventional lines, JR East says, "Depending on the time of day and section of the line, there may be cancellations or changes to the timetable.
 <<
 I heard that JR is able to run on its own power generation. It says that there may be some suspensions, but it seems to be OK: <a href='http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/news/110313/biz11031322070030- n1.htm'>[Great East Japan Earthquake] Train service reduced, convenience stores cut off for 24 hours. ... rotating blackouts, direct impact on daily life + (1/2 page) - MSN Sankei News</a> - MSN Sankei News</a> - MSN Sankei News</a> - MSN Sankei News</a
 >>
 　JR East generates 56% of its own electricity and purchases 44% from Tokyo, Tohoku, and Chubu Electric Power Companies, and while a short period of rotating blackouts is not expected to cause major disruptions to operations, the company has not decided how it will respond and may have to reduce the number of trains it operates.
 
 　On the other hand, private railways such as Tokyo Metro and Keihin Electric Express Railway depend almost entirely on TEPCO. Even if the supply to a substation in a blackout area is interrupted, operations can be continued by supplying power from other substations," according to an official. However, if a substation is located in a blackout area, operations will have to be suspended.
 <<
 The second half, either they can continue operation or they can't! Metro's official release just says "there is a possibility of major schedule changes" and no information at all....

 <BODY>If you have time to be silly, do some research and give some explanations, you idiot! <BR><BR>Conclusion, isodine should be applied to the body. <BR><BR>Conclusion, isodine is applied to the body, kelp is applied to the body. The reasons are as follows. <BR><BR>I did a lot of research and found that isodine contains something called Povidon iodine, which is not very efficient in absorption and has a bit of toxicity. <BR><BR>As far as I could tell, there was only one article that mentioned povidone iodine:<BR>"Disaster medicine By David E. Hogan, Jonathan L. Burstein"<BR>305 In the WHO's 1999 Iodine prophylaxis guidlines on page 305, it mentions the need to determine the dose required when applied to the skin (it also mentions that application to the skin is effective). <br><br>Many other articles suggest not taking large amounts of poydon iodine unless it is too much (since it is also used as a water quality improver, 3-5 drops should be fine, don't worry). :<br>http://www.portland-or.com/survive/index.html<br><br>Regarding ingesting (drinking/swallowing) iodine, iodine tablets (widely sold for water purification), tincture for water purification), tincture of iodine, or Povidone-iodine solutions (like the Betadine 〓 brand solution): Cresson H. Kearny, the author of Nuclear War Survival Skills, Original Edition Published September, 1979, by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a Facility of the U.S. Department of Energy ( Updated and Expanded 1987 Edition) states on page 115:<br><br> Elemental (free) iodine is poisonous, except in the very small amounts in water Furthermore, elemental iodine supplied by iodine tablets and released by tincture of iodine dropped into water is poisonous, except in the very small amounts in water. If you do not have any potassium iodide, DO NOT TAKE IODINE TABLETS OR TINCTURE OF IODINE.<br><br><br>There has been some interesting research, though, with both humans and dogs into topically (on the skin) There has been some interesting research, though, with both humans and dogs into topically (on the skin) applied Povidone-Iodine (10%) solution (such as Betadine 〓 or Povidex 〓 solutions), and also with tincture of iodine, to test the absorption rates of But, it was found not to be as quick in providing thyroid blocking as oral Potassium Iodide (KI) or KIO3, nor as consistent Questions remain of skin irritation, determining the amount of Iodine solution to apply, where best to apply it, how long to apply it, and how to apply it. Also, insufficient testing has been done on specific groups, such as infants, children, and then often, at lower levels of protection. Also, insufficient testing has been done on specific groups, such as infants, children, and pregnant and nursing women to know how effective it would be and the full range of complications that could be expected with repeated applications. For instance, the skin absorption of iodine products in neonates with inhibition of thyroid function has been documented in the past. The use of Povidone-Iodine is the most frequent cause of this type of intoxication. Another study showed that Povidone-Iodine did not significantly influence neonatal thyroid function if they were used to a full term neonate only once and even to a wide skin surface. <br><br>So, unless the situation is very bad, it may be better to limit ingestion to rinsing the mouth or through the skin, rather than ingestion by the caliber of the mouth. </body>

 <body>I was annoyed by people saying things like "everyone should drink isodine" without providing a source, so this entry is a bit wordy, but please forgive me. </body>.
