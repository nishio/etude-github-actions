Diversity Management
 For example, suppose you have an engineer who has trouble getting to work at 9:00 a.m. and is repeatedly late when you try to force him to come in. If you assign him to a meeting that starts at 9:00 a.m. and he is late, many organizations will say it is his fault.
 But even if he has these shortcomings, if he is a highly qualified engineer, he can be placed well and work profitably for the organization.
 In other words, whether he creates or damages value depends on the skill of management.
