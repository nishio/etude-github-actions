Scrapbox is a notebook
 The [metaphor] that "[Scrapbox] is a notebook" is very [useful].
 When I think of "[groupware]," I feel that it should be used by a group of several people, and using it by one person seems to be an exception.
 If it is a "notebook," then it should be used by [an individual] first and be comfortable being used by one person.
 Then, after the information has accumulated in the course of personal use, it is shared with others after the fact.
 Co-editing.
 As ideas are exposed to the eyes of others, they are transformed into something more useful.
