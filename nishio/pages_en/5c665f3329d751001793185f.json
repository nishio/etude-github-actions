The Big One.
	People feel fulfilled when they have a sense of connection to something greater.
	The "Great One" is an entity that transcends any one individual in size, duration, or capacity.
	I know some people get a spiritual feeling, but that's the principle that gives birth to religion.
	The concept of "God" and the community of those who follow that supposedly divine intention, "Love thy neighbor," is "the Great One."
	Traditions that have lasted for thousands of years and historic buildings are also "big things."

Used well, it can enhance an individual's life, but used maliciously, it can...
[How to Send Students to War] is an example.
Both "For Your Country" and "Be a Historical Man" are connections to something greater.
