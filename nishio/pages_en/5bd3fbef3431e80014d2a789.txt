OCR
Bookscan produces PDFs with OCR applied, so I thought that was fine and did not consider it in detail, but Google Cloud Vision's OCR performance was far superior.

 >(Bookscan) The second book, also by Katsuhiko Eguchi, is a management philosophy based on various memories of Konosuke. How can we succeed?
