　　　Added 2022-02-03 I'm drawing a direct collation as if it were a symbol-symbol collation, but isn't it a collation of felt meanings?
　　　　No, it's not. It's not good to try to paint with this kind of picture.
　　　　>Symbols are needed in any case for direct matching (p.112)
　　　　　Because experience without symbols is an ambiguous entity with no clear boundaries that cannot be manipulated and compared.
　　　　　The "experienced meaning" to which a symbol refers is checked against the "meaning of the symbol" to which another symbol refers.

　　　　　If we're going to paint a picture of these two comparisons as a first step, it seems more appropriate to make a collation between the perceived meanings.
