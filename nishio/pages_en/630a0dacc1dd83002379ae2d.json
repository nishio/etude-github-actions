`laboratory in cyberspace, in ghost in the shell style, cinematic atomosphere`

I really wanted it to be in cyberspace, but AI didn't seem to have any imagination when they said it was a lab in cyberspace.
ã€€Maybe I should have been more specific and said something like "translucent holographic 3D display"?

I told him that I made it with StableDiffusion, but since I started [C3: Computer Created Cats] after I made this background, I got an idea to make another cat-covered background.

Draw a cat at random.
