Age-related misperception of superiority is old age.
Unlike in the past, when superiority and inferiority were determined by strength alone, nowadays [axes are diversified], there are more [relationships without superiority or inferiority], such as "Mr. A is strong in this matter, but Mr. B is strong in that matter. The idea that you are superior to someone else in that situation is often simply false. And when that "misconception of [superiority]" is caused by being older or being a senior, it is called [old age].

		The thought that superior "alumni status, seniority, or elder status" arises because of "being an alumnus, a senior, or an elder," etc., is the cause of old age.
		So by being painfully aware that "I will lose my position," "I have lost my position," and "I never had a position in the first place," one becomes immune to the disease of senility.
