RoboMasterS1 dark driving movie
[https://youtu.be/KeFs8z0oW4M]
	I saw a piece once that was shot with LEDs on a Roomba with a long exposure.
	[RoboMaster S1] has LEDs and can be programmed to control them, so it should be easy to do something similar.
	When I was discussing this, I heard that it could be done with [Comparative Light Composition] instead of long exposure, and I thought, "I see," so I tried it.
	I think they should have run with colorful flashing LEDs anyway.
