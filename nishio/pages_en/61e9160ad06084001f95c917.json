Attribute expressions in iconic notation
from [/villagepump/attribute-expression with icon notation].
[/villagepump/nishio.icon]I learned about this when I saw this
　Operation to mirror all but a small portion of [/blu3mo-public/Scrapbox].
　　The public/private flag is expressed in icon notation.
　Scrapbox itself does not provide a way to add attributes when you want to add Boolean attributes to a page.
　There is a way to use "whether or not it contains some specific string."
　　If we [use the icon notation as a one-way link], we can avoid [the problem of too large links] on the related page, and we can also describe the meaning of the flag, killing two birds with one stone.
