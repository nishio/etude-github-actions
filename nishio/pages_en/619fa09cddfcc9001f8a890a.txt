	I read "An Introduction to Anti-Philosophy."
 This book was compiled by an editor who asked the author, a philosopher, verbatim. The author was concerned about "the same content coming up over and over again," but was told by the editor that "it is rather easy to understand what is important over and over again," which he found to be true. There's a similar thing in mathematics. I think that important things should be written more than once, but for some reason I think about making the same content appear only once, and then I worry about the order of the story.
 Well, that aside, the orally summarized portions of the book are very readable.
 There are two ways of thinking about the philosophical question of "why something exists": "becoming" and "making. Both Japan and ancient Greece believed that things come into being and "become" naturally. On the other hand, [Judaism] held the belief that "the Creator made the world.
 [Socrates] repeatedly denied the existing Greek philosophy, but did not create a new system himself. His disciple [Plato], perhaps under the influence of Judaism, believed that there existed an ideal "Idea" and that the real world was "made" in its image. After Plato, this idea of "making" became a strong force in Europe. One reason for this may be that [Christianity] used the framework of "nature" and "the transcendent who created it" for its own theoretical armament.
 In [Descartes], too, the idea is that a transcendent who has changed the form of "[reason]" creates the world by "thinking," so it is a continuation of the ground. At the time, Galileo was being put on trial for religion, so it was dangerous to contradict the Church's ideas. The idea was that human reason was correct because it was "guarded by [divine reason].
 A century or two after Descartes, Kant thought that we should get rid of "[the] hindsight of divine reason." This is what he refers to as "what is the Enlightenment? It is to get out of the [state of] underage that man has brought on himself. A minor is a state in which one cannot use one's reason without the guidance of others" ([What is Enlightenment]). Instead of taking God out of the picture and saying, "It's right because it's reason," [Critique of Pure Reason] considered how far one can go with pure reason alone, and what is too much to say.
 So, various philosophies after Plato have all dragged Plato's idea in that "the transcendent creates and therefore exists," and [Nietzsche] said that this is not right. His first study was "[The History of the Formation of Greek Tragedy]," and in the process he had the opportunity to come into contact with pre-Platonic thought. At the time, Darwin's theory of evolution was emerging, and some thought that if organisms change themselves to adapt to their environment, then human cognitive functions must have "become" adaptive to their environment as well.
 He believed that the "[will to power]" to "be stronger, to be greater" was the reason why existence "came to be" as it is now. He did not need to posit a transcendent being such as "God" or "Reason," and his idea was catchily expressed in the phrase "[God is dead].
 After this, we talked about Heidegger and Nazism, and then about Husserl, whom the author loves, but it seems that the author started to add more and more things to the conversation, and it became difficult to understand the details of the conversation. I am sorry to say that the story is now finished. Since I had read the book in e-book format, I did not feel that there were only a few pages left, and I was very surprised because it was written as if it was still in the middle of the story.
 So even though I don't know much about Heidegger and Husserl, the book was very easy to follow up to Nietzsche.
 Last time I read "[Introduction to Philosophy]" by Kitaro Nishida. Next, I intend to read "[Textbook of Philosophy]" by Yoshimichi Nakajima.
