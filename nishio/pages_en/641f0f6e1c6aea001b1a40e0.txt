Toward Effective Information Sharing and Tacit Knowledge to Language
There were references to a number of documents that were somehow loosely related, so I summarized them all in GPT4, summarized, summarized, summarized, and then had the page titles made up as I went along.

[GPT-4.icon][GPT-4.icon][GPT-4.icon][GPT-4.icon]
	Toward [Efficient Information Sharing] and [Tacit Knowledge into Language

[information sharing][nishio.icon].

[GPT-4.icon][GPT-4.icon][GPT-4.icon]
	The future is expected to be one in which the language model encourages the expansion of documents from query analysis, while taking into account the difficulty of converting [tacit knowledge] into [language] and the importance of documents, as well as the increased efficiency of [the person being asked to leave notes].

Query [$ \simeq ] Question [nishio.icon].

[GPT-4.icon][GPT-4.icon]
 The person being questioned keeps notes, which increases efficiency and accepts repeated questions.
 Tacit knowledge is difficult to be aware of and may be difficult to verbalize
 Documentation is important and could move in the direction of being expanded by the language model
 A future in which LLM summarizes readers' queries and makes suggestions for document expansion is anticipated.
 Careful use of "documented" and "undocumented" functions, proper documentation facilitates maintenance

[GPT-4.icon]
 [/villagepump/the person being questioned leaves a note]:.
  Discussion of cases that differ from endorsement
  Veteran engineer feeling
  Talk about avoiding duplicate explanations.
  Few opportunities to be on the receiving end of questions due to lack of ability
  Synonyms: written by someone who doesn't understand
 [/yuta25/You should ask people the same thing over and over again].
  You can ask the same question over and over again.
  It is more efficient for the person asked to create a memo (Wiki)
  Listeners do not take notes and ask questions again
  The person asked can record accurate information.
  Repeated questions increase the likelihood that the person asked will realize the importance of documentation.
 [/mrsekut-p/the person asked leaves a note].
		Documentation by the person being questioned
  Those in the know often get the same questions over and over again.
  It is more efficient to explain in writing rather than verbally
  Write it down once and give it to them, and if they don't understand it, update it.
  Questioners focus on understanding and no longer need to take notes
 [/sta/ tacit knowledge is hard to be aware of].
 	Tacit knowledge is determined by others and circumstances and is difficult to be aware of
  What a person thinks is tacit knowledge may not necessarily be tacit knowledge
  Some people have difficulty with metacognition and may not recognize tacit knowledge
  Tacit knowledge that is difficult to verbalize also exists.
 Important Pathways
  Documented" functions include "you may use", but "undocumented" functions should not be used.
  Even if the code is implemented and working, if it is used without permission, it will be difficult to maintain.
  Documents are important and will not disappear
  Language model may move away from query analysis toward expanded documentation
  A future in which LLM summarizes readers' queries and makes suggestions for document expansion is anticipated.

> "Don't ask people the same thing over and over!" but that's not true. It is more efficient for the person being asked to write a wiki, so the person asking should ask the same thing many times without taking notes. >> Verbalize what you don't understand and let the other person answer.
