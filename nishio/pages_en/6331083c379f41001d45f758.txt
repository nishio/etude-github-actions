>"Within the scope of the R&D areas set by [Cybozu Labs], you are guaranteed to be able to devote at least 50% of your work time to R&D themes that you set yourself. In a nutshell, we say, 'You can do whatever you want half the time,' but if you look closely, you may find yourself doing what you like 100% of the time (laughs)" (Aono) [src https://japan.cnet.com/article/20367070/2/].
