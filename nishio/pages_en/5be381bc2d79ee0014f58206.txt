Communication is not good
When I say I'm not a good communicator, people say, "You give so many lectures and stuff?" I'm not a good communicator.
	1: Putting your thoughts into words and sending them out to an unspecified number of people
	2: Listen to the other person's ideas and communicate your own.
 3: Capture the other person's emotions
There are many kinds of what we call communication; I'm good at 1, but not so good at 3.
