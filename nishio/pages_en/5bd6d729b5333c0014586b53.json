Group Selection and Movement
	Multiple slides can now be moved together.
 But [highlighting multiple slides] isn't done yet, so I'll have to move it around to see which one is selected.
	There is a bug that leaves a highlight (red plate for) when a single selection is made.

	Enforce the rule of "expressing that you are a group by placing them close together" in a [KJ method] way.
 That way, you don't have to select the group in the first place with a rectangular selection or a lasso tool.
  Being a group = being placed in close proximity
  The only thing left is how to set that threshold.
	The current method of designation is not very intuitive.
 	Simply the distance to the nearest slide at the start of the drag is the threshold.
 	Intuitively, I'd like to drag it closer.
