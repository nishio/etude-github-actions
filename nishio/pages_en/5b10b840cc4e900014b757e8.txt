A mass of raw data and meaning
[https://gyazo.com/fa8b22f43b2e239ee8fedd15a0cc721a]

	Discussion on how to [organize] [information] in Scrapbox #Information organization
 Especially "20180525 notes" or "Notes from the 5th something meeting."
 This is "[raw data]" that I wrote down what I thought I should write down on the spot
 It's not formatted for me to read back to myself.
  It's not "[read]."
  The [tasteless] title is proof of this.
  The reason it doesn't have a title that gives you an idea of what's in it is because it hasn't yet reached the "[mass of meaning]" that would allow you to give it a single title.
 So the first thing I do when I read back the "raw data" is prepare for the next time someone else reads it back to me.
  To cut out a chunk of meaning and give it a title that is easy to understand.
  If you're not comfortable rewriting or erasing raw data, leave that untouched.
  On a new page, we can just extract the important parts.
 After the mass of meaning
  It is only when it becomes a mass of meaning that it becomes "[kenkai-kun]" that comes to life ([even if]).
  Mr. Knowledge meets and becomes friends with related knowledge.
   Link as in Scrapbox
   For example, this page is tagged "organizing information".
   Knowledgebase users can later find "pages with the same tags", i.e., "Knowledgebase users with the same interests", using the Scrapbox functionality.
  Sometimes, knowledge kuns with differing opinions meet and spark new discussions.
   As a result of discussions, they change slightly from each other or coalesce to create a new knowledge kun

   This is how it gradually develops and creates a society ([network of knowledge]).

 Giving a title to a group of lines in Scrapbox is the same as giving a [nameplate] to a group of sticky notes in the [KJ method] #Making nameplates
