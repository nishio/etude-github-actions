The "key is balance" is not a goal, but a start.

Suppose you have two options, A and B, and you are wondering which is better.
This is [a false choice], and there is a better possibility of a choice that is neither A nor B.

The idea that "the key is balance" is a step forward from assuming there are only two options, but it's not the goal.
　Is it possible to achieve balance?
　How do we know the proper balance?

The [resolution phase] is the first step where you change from two choices to [a third option].

Implicit in "balancing" is the assumption of a [trade-off between the two attributes].

Balance is not the goal, it's the start.
[balance].
