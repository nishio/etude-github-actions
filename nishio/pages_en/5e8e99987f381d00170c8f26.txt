In buying a new iPad for my wife, I looked at the state of my current iPad after 2 years of use to choose which storage size to get 2020-04-09
I've got PDFs, etc. in Dropbox and then I have them stored on my device with "offline access" to read them on the train, etc. without worrying about communication, which is of course bulky, next is Kindle.
RoboMaster is big because of the video taken with the robot's camera in it, but it's never good when you take it out, and the two below it are apps I downloaded to try out but haven't used.

So, as it stands, I can get by with 128 if I delete the garbage, and 256 is like doubling the safety factor.
