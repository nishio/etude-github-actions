Kozane Method and Outliner
https://rashita.net/blog/?p=12582
>Kozane is 1/4 the size of a B6 card, which can be used as a notebook. There is a difference in the contents that can be written on it.
> A record as an accumulation of information must be well organized so that even a "future self" (i.e., a different person) can read it, but this is not the case with kozane. Fragments or symbolic words are sufficient. Moreover, such fragmentation is easier to manipulate.
> Kozane does not need details. In fact, they are even a hindrance.
