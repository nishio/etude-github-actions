Directors and Executive Officers
	Director is a position defined in the Companies Act
 	Officers under the Companies Act = Directors + Corporate Auditors + Accounting Counselors
 	A stock company must have at least one director

	Officers under the Corporate Tax Law
 	Broader concept than corporate law
  Persons who are deemed to be substantially engaged in the management of the company.
		A person who is not an officer under the Companies Act but is considered an officer under tax law = deemed officer
  Remuneration paid to directors under the Corporate Tax Law = Director's remuneration
		Executive compensation is treated differently under tax law.
  	It is not permissible to increase executive compensation and recognize a loss when the company makes a profit.

 Executive officers are not officers under the Companies Act.
 	I am an employee.
  Like "department head," etc., it is a title not specifically prescribed by law.

	A director may also serve as an executive officer due to lack of manpower or other reasons
