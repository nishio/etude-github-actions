more haste, less speed
What is this "turn"?

"Mononofu no Yabashi no Yabashi no Boat ga Fukyuu but Hashigaya ha Mawaru Seta no Nagahashi."
When crossing Lake Biwa, there were two ways to cross: by boat or by detouring and crossing by bridge. The story goes that crossing by boat would be delayed or capsized by a gust of wind, so it is better to use a bridge.

Especially in the case of warriors, the damage in the event of a capsize is greater than that of ordinary people because of their heavy luggage. In addition, if a large number of people board multiple boats and wait for the slowest person to arrive, delays, which have a low probability of occurring, will occur more frequently than for individual travelers because "if it happens on any one of the boats, it will affect them.
