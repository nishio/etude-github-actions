 Thoughts.
 　N=18
 　Since the operation can be repeated infinitely, first consider the "set reachable by repeating the operation"?
 　　Is it subtle because it also requires a minimum number of times required?
 　Can repeat compatibility in any order
 　Flip over if it's an odd number away from the original position.
 　2^18 is less than 10^6, I'd say that's within the computable range of multiplying by 18.
 　　No, it's a permutation, so 18!
 　If the constraints were not met when the first and second cards were set, they will not be met thereafter.
 　　But you can't search while pruning branches with this, because it would be a full search in cases where everything has the same value.
 　　This kind of case could be quickly obtained by finding the minimum value.
 Official Explanation
 　[bit DP]
 　I'm not sure of the specifics.

　　>Minimum value of the operation when the already aligned set is msk and the last value is lst
　　The set of used values is 2^N, so express this in bits
　　I don't know if that is enough to keep the "monotonic increase" and add to it, so I'll hold the last card as well.
　　O(N 2^N)

　Use [the order of operations does not matter] with respect to the area before the boundary.
