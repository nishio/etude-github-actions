(3.5.7.2) Use personal experiences
There are also merits that you can use your personal [experience]s to make question cards yourself.

For example, I learned "Come back to Sorrento" in a junior high school music class as a choir song. I sang "♪Vide'o mare quant'è bello!" and I did not understand the meaning of lyrics. "Vide" is a Neapolitan word, meaning "see." There are words "videos" and "visuals" as the English word which has the common root. "Mare" means "sea," there is the word "marine."

For me, "♪Vide'o mare ~" is a vivid memory with melodies, but for most readers, it is not. Such personal information is the advantage of making your learning materials yourself. In the 20 rules to structure knowledge, there are "Rule 13: Refer to other memories" "Rule 14: Personalize and provide examples" "Rule 15: Rely on emotional states." By associating with your other memories, experience, and emotion, you can memorize easier.
