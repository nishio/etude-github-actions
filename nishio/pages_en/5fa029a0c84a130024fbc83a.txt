Thoughts.
　1: all gcd's are 1
　2: One and the other sum, gcd is not 1
　3: Element is less than 30000
　Hmmm, I can't image it, but from condition 2, 1 can't be a factor.
　If there is a 2, then one or more odd numbers exist. And any addition other than 2 is even.
　It is easy to show that there is no size 2 solution
　Consider the time of 3
　　If there are two, the other two are odd.
　　If there are 3, the rest is 3n+1
　　Odd, 3n+1, and a multiple of 5
　　　25.
　　Therefore, 2, 3, and 25 are solutions
　Think of a time when 4.
　　One even number in the remaining three.
　　If there are 3, then the sum of the remaining two is 3n+1
　　If there is a 5, then the remaining one is 5m.
　　Hmmm, that's going to be a lot of splitting up.
　2+3+25=30=2x3x5.
　 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 = 210 well distributed...how?
　You're thinking too hard about the constraints.
　　The condition that all gcd's are 1 holds for 2 x 3, 3 x 5, and 5 x 2
　　But in this instance, condition 2 is impossible.
　If condition 1 is not present
　　Easy, just make them all even numbers or something.
　　Put two odd numbers to satisfy condition 1.
　　 Condition 2 holds for all but odd numbers.
　　For condition 2 to hold for this odd number?
　　　Odd prime numbers, both sides must have something in common
　　　Let a, b be two odd numbers and c be the sum of even numbers
　　　Need common divisor for a+c and b, b+c and a
　　　　No, because if these two terms match, condition 1 is broken.
　　　　What if a=3n, b=5m?
　　　　I think I can find it with no problem, but I'd like to code it and check.
　　　　c cannot be a multiple of 3 or 5, but it can be an even number, so just adjust as appropriate
　　　　If c's remainder at 3 or 5 is determined, so are a's and b's.
　　　　The [Chinese Modulus Theorem] guarantees that there is a number satisfying the condition up to 30.

　Official Explanation
　　I overlooked the severity of the restrictions.
　　　If you're choosing 2,000 pieces with less than 3,000 elements, you can't take the "mostly even" option.
　　I assumed that the sum is a multiple of 2, which led me to a method that consists of numbers up to about 4000.
　　　The official explanation method is to assume that this is "the sum is a multiple of 2 and 3".
　　If the sum is a multiple of 2 and 3, and the components are multiples of 2 or 3, then "2: One and the sum of the others, gcd not 1" is satisfied
　　If 2 and 3 are in the components, then "1: all gcd's are 1" is also satisfied.
