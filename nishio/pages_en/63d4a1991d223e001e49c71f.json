Cutting from complex pages
 I'll try my best to verbalize what I thought when I cut out from a complex page[/villagepump/nishio.icon].

 　1: "I'm deeply indented here, and I want to cut to the chase because I'm concentrating my talk on a potentially useful topic" (red, A).

 　2: "If I just put this on a separate page, it won't make sense," so I'll duplicate the story up to the point where it appears, once in the foreground (blue, B).
 　　I had to make a glue line on the original page once [glue line is needed for cutting out].

 　3: Think "I need a title to put on this chunk."
 　 That title is made from A, not B (Orange, C).

 　3.5: (Added) Cut out at this time
 　 [https://gyazo.com/7f8847f4c8a752988d0696cc3692af70]
   At this point, only the "new page title" C remains on the original page
 　4: If it's just title C, it's just a keyword placed abruptly - I don't know what it means, so I'll add some content here to fill in the gaps (pink, D).
