 At that time, embassies of various countries were evacuated to Hakone and Karuizawa. The location of the embassies was communicated to the U.S. through the neutral country of Switzerland.

  Gen Tanabe retired from Kyoto Imperial University on March 31, 1945, and immediately moved to Karuizawa, where he did not come down until after the war.
