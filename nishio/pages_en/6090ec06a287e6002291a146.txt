 *1297652901* Even with a reflectance of 0.77%, the reflection is rather large.
 Since I had a seat change at work, the lights started reflecting on my monitor and I was suffering from eyestrain, so I decided to put a sheet on my monitor. I couldn't find a good size non-glare sheet, so I bought a glossy sheet with a reflectivity of 0.77%...

 In fact, it's getting worse...orz
 
 Lesson learned: It doesn't matter much if the reflectance value looks very small.
 
 
 
 I'd much rather stick a plastic bag from a convenience store on it...
