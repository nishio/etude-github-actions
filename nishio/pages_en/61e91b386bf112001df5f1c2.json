[Monte Carlo tree search - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search]

	For balancing exploitation and exploration, UCT ([Upper Confidence Bound] applied to trees) algorithm was introduced by Levente Kocsis and Csaba Szepesvári.

	I explain about [Upper Confidence Bound]([UCB1]) algorithm in [(2.2.3.2-2) UCB1 algorithm].
