How to use social capital
I have talked about how [financial capital] goes away when you spend it, [knowledge capital] doesn't go away when you spend it, and [social capital] requires a knack for using it, but if you use it well, it increases. #Money goes away when you spend it.

 When there is a demand D and a supply S, value is created by an intermediary M who knows both and causes them to combine.
 In the case of commodity trading, M corresponds to the market.
 In that case, the commodity is separated from the producer and distributed independently.
 However, knowledge, especially knowledge in the sense of solution capability rather than information, cannot be distributed separately from people.
 Similarly, for a variety of reasons, demand on the demand side can often not be distributed in isolation from the consumers
 Therefore, there is a type of transaction in the world in which neither a market in which "suppliers display their products and consumers buy them" nor a market in which "consumers post jobs and suppliers apply for them" can be used.
 Providing lubrication for that type of transaction is value creation, just as markets create value by creating lubrication for commodity transactions.
 So the intermediary M is the supplier at this time in the form of [matching] value provision.

  If we design the system so that intangible capital is attracted to M in exchange for providing that value, positive feedback will turn around.
 	What are the conditions and how to design them are the current concerns
  I think it's a requirement that after the D and S transaction occurs, there should be an increase in Happiness for both parties.
  	Because trust in intermediary M will decrease if the transaction does not lead to a positive outcome.
  	Therefore, the act of introducing S to D, to anyone, lowers D's trust.
   On the other hand, if you introduce a not-so-good D to S, it lowers S's trust in you.
   So M needs to do its best to scrutinize and screen and filter out the participants who are not good.
