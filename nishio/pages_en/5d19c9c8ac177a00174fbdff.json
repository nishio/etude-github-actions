Lasso selection bug
		Dotted lines disappear by clicking or starting a new drag, but the highlighted state of selected stickies does not disappear
 	No group selected?
	The latter is simply an omission of implementation.
	In the former case, the implementation of highlighting the selection grabbed the selection at the time of LassoTool initialization, so the code to remove the highlight is running against the initial selection (`= []`), so the highlight is not removed.
