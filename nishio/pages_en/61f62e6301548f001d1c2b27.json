Avoid worrying about others.
Under the guise of concern, there are others who only offer advice even though they are not involved in the project. Do not waste your opportunity by listening to such "concern.

If "concern" doesn't help your project, don't listen. Do not be the person who says such things.

Avoiding Worry
lxiv 

Such prudence brings its own rewards. It escapes much, becomes a midwife of comfort, a midwife of happiness. It neither gives nor receives bad news unless it helps. Some are deafened by the sweets of flattery, some by the bitterness of scandal, some by the daily annoyances without which they cannot live. It is not a rule of life to prepare oneself for a lifetime of trouble in order to give someone, no matter how close to you, a temporary pleasure. Moreover, it is a common saying that when the obligation to another involves putting oneself at a disadvantage, it is better for the other to suffer now than for oneself to suffer later in vain.

Avoid Worry.

Such prudence brings its own reward. It escapes much, and is thus the midwife of comfort and so of happiness. Neither give nor take bad news unless it can help. Some men's ears are stuffed with the sweets of flattery; others with the bitters of scandal, while some cannot live without a daily annoyance no more than Mithridates could without poison. It is no rule of life to prepare for yourself lifelong trouble in order to give a temporary enjoyment to another, however near and dear. You never ought to spoil your own chances to please another who advises and keeps out of the affair, and in all cases where to oblige another involves disobliging yourself, ’tis a standing rule that it is better he should suffer now than you afterwards and in vain.
