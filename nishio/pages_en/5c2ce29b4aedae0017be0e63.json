Krechevsky 1932
Krechevsky 1932's experiment that rats "have a hypothesis and learn by testing it" instead of "learning from the results of random trial-and-error"; when rats are asked to learn "the dark side is correct" and then "the light side is correct" in a choice between two alternatives, they first choose the dark side and fail 100% of the time Then, the next behavior is to choose a specific side (like the right side), and the percentage of correct answers increases to only 50%, and then the behavior to choose the light side is produced.
Conversely, if a task that cannot be learned is learned with a random mixture of "right side or left side" and "light side or dark side," it will behave for a while, for example, by trying the right side, then trying the dark side this time because it cannot be solved with that side....
