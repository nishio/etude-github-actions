	[Shenzhen Means of Payment]

Day 0 (8/9)
	15:55NRT→20:00HKG
	Designed to communicate locally via WeChat
		I had been using Mattermost until just before the event, but there was a possibility that we might not be able to connect locally (a fear that was unfounded).
		It is better to increase the volume of information distribution, but it is not good to push out the communication channel, so a separate chat room was created for chit-chat.
		Dice and rock-paper-scissors stamps by default, good.
		I was asked after a while if there was a "pinning" function. I answered "No, if you need it, you can use the pinned chat to "forward" the message," but it never went into operation.
			Only important communications can be channeled to the contact chat.
			There can be adult-only chat.
				(Maybe even a kids-only chat).
	[Weibo]

	Demonstrations in Hong Kong had intensified even before the tour.
		For safety reasons, take a ferry directly from Hong Kong Airport to Shekou Shekou in Shenzhen
	I had bought a data SIM in advance for local communication, but did not have a SIM replacement pin, so I borrowed one.
	When I arrived at the Hong Kong airport, I suddenly received an SMS.
		It seems to be an AU service that says, "In this country, you can get free internet for 24 hours a day.
		[Free World Data Flat-rate Campaign].
		Good service.

			Ginger juice, lemon-like drink, dried tangerine peels, sweet and salty.
		In this natural, I was thinking of keeping a diary in Chinese to practice my Chinese as well.

			After this, the amount of input information was so large that Chinese was not fast enough to record it, so I went back to Japanese.
			Also, WeChat communication among people who came to the area was more important than writing to people in Japan.
	Arrive at hotel around midnight [Facebook https://www.facebook.com/ukai.yu/posts/10219343666923124]
	VPN Information
		They recommended ExpressVPN for 30 days free, but I was too tired to do that on the first day!
	Coke in the fridge is 25 RMB, 375 yen
		A 500 ml Coke costs RMB 5 in the city
	Q: Do I need to tip the bed-making staff? A: NO
	Q: How do I drain the bath water? A: Turn the drain cap-like thing on top of the valve.
	Whether the room needs to be cleaned or not is toggled by a button, just like a light switch.

Day 1 (8/10)
	Breakfast dining room is an operation where you verbally say your room number.
	I immediately locked in my room card key, but after authenticating it at the front desk with my room number and date of birth, a new card key was issued.
	I asked a local person to send money to Alipay, but when I tried to use the money to send money to Tokoroten and each other to test the operation, we both got hit. see [Shenzhen means of payment].

		He said the cause is unclear and it may not be a good idea to be in development mode.
	Create a hero
		There's a RoboMaster cartoon on Netflix.
		"affordable is important in education"
			The context of small drones, that it is important for education to have access to them yourself.
			　I understood that it is important to be able to buy inexpensive products, own them, and tinker with them as much as I want, instead of spending limited time at programming schools with expensive products that cost tens of thousands of dollars.
	You can also program drones in block language and Python.
		Somersaults are also one line
			It's an easy mechanism to do great things by adding a middle layer, PHP-like.
		Images taken below from the drone are sent to a computer, where the position is estimated and misalignment correction information is fed back to the drone.
			The cloth that is drawn underneath has a black and white pattern on it, which probably acts as a marker.
			Drones collided with each other during the demonstration.
			The fabric was flapping in the wind from the drone itself, which may have caused the crash.
			If the floor was like a gymnasium, they would have taped it, but since it was a hotel conference room, I guess the situation is that they couldn't fix it.
	Actually split into teams of 5 players each to play against each other.
		Can be operated with manual controls.
			As a result, you can teach them how to operate the system and play against each other on the spot without much advance preparation time.
			We're lowering the hurdle for the first step.

			The cord seen in the back is the recovery point.
				Hit points are recovered when the camera is ready to recognize the mark.
			Other special items and other items can be used by scanning the mark.
	Writing a program allows you to create "custom actions".
		Writing programs to accomplish things that would be difficult to accomplish with manual human manipulation
		Writing the program makes my robot stronger.
		It's truly "Learn to win."

		The graphic data showing that Japan, and the older generation in Japan, underestimates China compared to the rest of the world, and the glimpse I saw of bookstores made me feel a sense of urgency to see this with my own eyes. I will go see the exhibition tomorrow.

	My impression of Shenzhen书城 [Facebook https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10218956377636958]
		I don't get the impression that the "technical level is very high." Rather, my impression is that it is both high and low, and that there is variation.
		It seems to me that the Japanese publishing industry has been optimized to "publish books that sell" (i.e., introductory books for amateurs), making it difficult to produce highly specialized books, whereas the Chinese market has not been optimized in this way. Related: [setting the wrong KPIs].
		I think this trend of optimization has been strengthened by the shrinking of the Japanese publishing market, so it may not happen in China in the foreseeable future.
		In China, the number of Chinese readers is much larger than in Japan, and this may be a reason for publishing technically sophisticated content with a small target audience without much concern. In terms of not having to be sensitive to the volume of intended readers when selecting a theme, a comparison could be made with the dojinshi market, such as the Gijutsu Shokuten (Technical Book Exhibition).

	This is the biggest gap when compared to Japan.
		[https://gyazo.com/6f397bfa895e4a48c81637f0fac2184c]
		There's a military section.
		In Japan, illustrated books for young children include Self-Defense Forces vehicles, and the printing of additional copies is stopped (i.e., no more copies can be printed and distributed).
			[The nature of the illustrated "Hataraku Kuruma" issue - Who is a threat to free speech - Agora http://agora-web.jp/archives/2040906.html]
		While in Japan it is considered taboo and its distribution is halted, the configuration of this bookstore suggests that it would normally be distributed in China.
		If publishers fear the risk of stopping reprints, they are less likely to publish books that mention those kinds of topics.
			As a result, there is little way to know what the rest of the world is up to, etc.
			The lack of knowledge increases fear and even more so emotional repulsion: [knowledge is the antidote to fear].
		Shelf

			This flat green book is labeled "Future Wars."
				"Future Wars: Science and Technology in Global New Collision" (Science and Technology and Global New Collision)
				Originally published in English as "Future War: Preparing for the New Global Battlefield" ([Amazon https://amzn.to/303ItLe])
				The Japanese translation is "Future War: Can the U.S. Military Win the War? " ([Amazon https://amzn.to/305qALQ])
				 It's a title that makes me wonder if it's being translated properly.
			[3 photos https://twitter.com/kyasbal_1994/status/1160380997361266688]
				I'm curious to see what "The Great Japanese Defeat" is all about.
			What kind of books did you have?" The first thing I remembered was "Clausewitz and Sun Tzu's The Art of War were lined up."

			Paying 50 yuan for a bomb at a convenient store, you can feel like you've splurged about 5,000 yen, but it's actually 750 yen, so it's cosy!
	Twitter must have decided that I was not Japanese because I tweeted in simplified Chinese, and for some reason started showing ads in Hangul (lol).
	It's never good to praise something to the detriment of something else.

	Visit to 编程猫(CodeMao) for Japan-China exchange
		Hackathon with a group of local students [video https://www.facebook.com/yasulab/videos/10156423463650869/? __tn__=H-R]

		The IDE of the 编程 cat is quite amazing.
			[CodeMaoIDE]
		It was interesting to see the creators play a game with the Chinese students during the ice break where they were told to be in groups of numbers.
			The phenomenon of one person being left out after being told to "pair up in twos" is slowly and incrementally generated.
			Reduce the number of people by a little bit, like "eight" or "five.
			Those who were not selected leave the program after losing, and those who were not selected continue.
			Of course, those who actively form groups win out.
				Bias in favor of positive group formation.
				The management can observe who is not good at group formation.
		Language barriers
			This person is a native speaker of Japanese and speaks some English, and the other person is a native speaker of Chinese and speaks some English.
			Would we be able to form a team and communicate properly in this state? I was worried.
			I was thinking of helping out as a Japanese-English interpreter who can read Chinese if needed.
			When the lid was opened, the students were conversing directly by converting Japanese and Chinese using Baidu Translate.
			It is logged and rather preferable to verbal conversations.
			I expected that there would be clerks and security guards who did not speak English, so I tried to learn some of the local language, but the locals rather used translation hardware or automatic translation on their phones, which made me feel sorry for being so weak-minded.
			　Yesterday at the RoboMaster venue, I pronounced "洗手间"(toilet) with my mouth to the security guard and he didn't get the message, but it was poor thinking not to come up with "let your phone pronounce it" or "write it down and show it to you" there.
				>Jerry Chen Google Translate works fine, but i think is helpful to learn the basics in the local language wherever you go.
				>Nishio Hirokazu 不错，It is better, but it is not "must" anymore. I must keep in mind it is not necessary for activity of new age students
			>A team consists of one Chinese and one Japanese person each, so the group that is not good at English can use translation software in real time for the hackathon.
   > It's a great time. Even if you don't have language skills, you can create something together for the same task with almost no loss of time.

	　I've noticed a few examples of children saying, "Don't you have to go all the way overseas to do that? I realized that for adults who are already free, overseas is "a place to do things you can't do in Japan", while for children whose freedom is still restricted in Japan, it is "a place to do things you can't do in Japan".
	I told him that it would be better to look at medium-sized modules such as coin identification modules or receipt printer modules instead of small electronic parts or large finished products in an electronics town, and he pointed out that it is not cost-effective for stores to put such small and large products on the shelves, and that it is also not safe for buyers to pay for them after checking their operation in escrow. I was also told that it is easier to find modules on aliexpress than in stores, and that it is safer to pay after confirming the operation through an escrow transaction.
	Of course it is good that larger libraries in urban areas are improved, but for children living in rural areas, they want their local libraries to be improved, right? Libraries are a system where books are collected in one place and moved by humans, and as the logistics system evolves, it will be the books that move, not the humans.

			Unlike cash, the person who paid has evidence of payment.
			No risk of cash theft
		I understood that this was the case.
		Just as the creation of the information communication layer called the Internet has lowered the initial investment costs of the information business and made it easier to start a business, the creation of a cashless layer will create another new business.
		alipay is not a "store payment method" but a unified money distribution layer that says "you can pay stores and transfer money between individuals all the way".
		　I'd like to tell my past self who thought, "Why don't you just use SUICA?" and say, "Tell me when you can use SUICA to pay your allotment or give money to your friends."
		For example, the company cafeteria at Cybozu now has a Suica reader, and each person pays by operating a button on the reader, but if the Suica layer is replaced by Alipay, the device can be a QR code.
		　This means no more rental costs for reading equipment.
		You can create an Alipay app on top of the Alipay layer. When scanned, the app will ask for access rights.

		Crystalline vibration is basically a crystal oscillator, but if a modifier is added, the meaning may change. I wonder if a voice surface crystal oscillator is a type of microphone that uses Rochelle salt crystals to convert voice surface waves into electricity, since voice surface waves are waves that travel over the surface of an object.
			Apparently not. A [voice surface resonator http://www.konuaer.com/lmportCrystal/SAW.html] is a SAW resonator, which generates surface waves by forming comb-shaped electrodes on the surface of a quartz crystal in alternating directions. This makes it possible to create a transmitter with a sharp frequency response and short wavelengths in accordance with the pitch of the comb. The linked R315M datasheet states 315MHz.
