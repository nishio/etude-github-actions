(5.2.3.1-2) Group organization
"Group organization" is divided into the following three further steps.

 ❶ [Label spreading]
 ❷ [Label gathering]
 ❸ [Nameplate making]

Of these, "label spreading" is a task to spread pieces of paper on a desk. I already explained it in [(5.2.1) Spread so that you can see the whole at a glance].

"Label gathering" is a task of moving pieces closer to what is likely to be related and creating groups. I briefly introduced it, but I explain it in detail later. 

Finally, we make "[nameplate]." After we create groups, we bundle multiple pieces of paper into one pile. Then we attach a "nameplate" which explains pieces in the group.

For example, suppose you have 100 pieces at the beginning. After you make groups, which have 3 to 5 pieces per group, bundling them reduces the number of objects to about 25. It goes to a more manageable quantity.

Nameplates are the explanation of pieces in a group. It is to [extract] only the important part of "too much information." It is related to [(1.4.3.2) Hide non-critical parts = Extract important parts]. The process is a kind of [abstraction].

For these 25 piles, you repeat the label gathering again. Then it goes 6 to 7 piles. By repeating this process, "too much information" finally goes into a few piles. Now you can roughly understand the overview of 100 pieces which you wrote. It is a process to [grasp the whole picture].
