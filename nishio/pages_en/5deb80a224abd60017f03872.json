Export Tool
	Regroup is not currently willing to use the write out method itself.
		I'm on Facebook.
	The export tool on the iPhone, if everything is automatically saved in the first place, wouldn't there be a need to send it piece by piece?
		One huge text area, or...
	No, it's not. By the fact that once you write it, you can't rewrite it again (not necessarily, but it's a hassle), you're afforded to write more and more without going back and forth.
		When you think something you wrote earlier is different, you don't go back and correct it or delete it, you write, "No, it's not."
	 I mean, I'm having a conversation with myself from a while ago.
	 	[Do not erase]
 There are cases in which you can erase what you have written and cases in which you cannot erase what you have written, and only in the cases in which you cannot erase what you have written, you become an uneditable entity.
		On the other hand, unlike "recording what is spoken", the output is fed back as text.

	I thought it would be better to make it as a separate app so that it can flow into stickies in the future, since the export tool, as it is now, lacks the benefit of gachanching.
		And for stickies, I can't "paste the exported item into Scrapbox" without a way to convert it back to text format again.
		If you group stickies and enter the "order to follow," they will be output as bulleted notes and can be posted directly to Scrapbox.

 If I can export in Scrapbox format from the export tool, I'd like to be able to paste and format my Facebook and Slack logs as well.
	 It would be nice to be able to make a sticky note of what you've written down, but that's not a priority either.
