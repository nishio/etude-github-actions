Etymology of [knowosphere
>The noosphere is a philosophical concept created and popularized by the Soviet biogeochemist Vladimir Vernadsky and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin. Vernadsky defined the nousphere as a new stage of the biosphere and described the earth as a "sphere of reason. The noosphere represents the highest stage in the development of the biosphere, and its defining factor is the development of mankind's rational activity.
> 
> The word is derived from the Greek words νοῦς (nous, spirit, reason) and σφαῖρα (sphere, space); lexical analogues include atmosphere and biosphere.... A second generation of authors has further developed the concept by Vernadsky, mainly of Russian origin, creating related concepts (noocenosis and noocenology).
> ... Although this theory is currently scientifically rejected and not even proven, in recent years it is often used as a metaphor for "knowledge accumulation" on the Internet. Eric Raymond, an open source activist, has published a book entitled "[Homesteading the Noosphere]" ("Homesteading the Noosphere").
