　Create a summary in tanka
 [57577.icon]Amateurs quickly run out of characters, but the formulas that history has created are weapons.
 [57577.icon][Amateurs who try to follow the formulas cut down on particles and chop them up].
 　It's too obvious and funny.
 　 [57577.icon]For now, let's just enjoy the frame as a puzzle without removing the particles from the future.
 　 [57577.icon] A word order swap puzzle occurs when a fixed form is filled without removing a particle.
 　 [57577.icon] You need a vocabulary that fits well without garbage like "for now".
　You wrote [57577.icon] that I should make it a daily habit, but honestly, I'm [not good at] continuity.
　　[57577.icon][- I wonder if the fine tuning of the GPT-3 will help].
　　[57577.icon]I have a fantasy of making GPT-3 a fine tuning corpus.

　　　WW is too free.
　[57577.icon]I tried to put "compose a tanka poem" into AI and was scolded to "write it by yourself"[nishio.icon].
　I feel like I'm just describing the facts.
　[57577.icon]From the beginning to the end, everyone sees the poetic form of tanka poetry at the same time.
　　I see what you mean.
　　[57577.icon]Select and design the text type of the string as you see it at a glance.
　[57577.icon]The sense of choosing "Beto Beto Hikaru" instead of the familiar "Kirakira Hikaru"!
　[57577.icon][- Will your work improve with socializing? Look at a blank piece of paper rather than a person's face]]
　　Is it a good idea to cut this "person" head? [nishio.icon].
　　[57577.icon]Works don't get better with association. Look at a blank piece of paper rather than a person's face.
　[57577.icon][- Build a strong individual first, and then we will go together into the unknown.]
　　I wonder if it is better to say "Let's go together into the unknown 7" or "Let's go together into the unknown 7" in order to keep the pattern.
　　In layman's terms, the latter seems to sit better[nishio.icon].
　　Ah, well, it's better to solve this with an expanded perspective instead of trying to work this out with a tweak of a particle.
　　[57577.icon][Build a solid individual first, then we can climb the mountain together that has yet to be seen.]
　[57577.icon][Most people who give me shit rip are the ones who don't do their own work well].
　　Programming is the same in this area.
　[57577.icon]It is said that if you have one million yen, you can publish a book of poems, and the first book of poems is published at your own expense.
