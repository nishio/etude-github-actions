Write a sentence and then give it a title.
A hypothetical proposed method of useful intellectual production at [Unnamed Camp].
I've done a lot of work on my own, and this could be pretty good.
　[Titling later is a KJ method of nameplate making].

When I think, "I'm going to write about X," I tend to write "X" in the title and then start writing and keep the title
However, there are cases where I think about the title after I write it, and it doesn't turn out to be that title.
I've always started writing with an appropriate title like "Ahhh" when I can't think of a title at the stage of starting to write but have something I want to write about.
Doing it anytime, that is.
Maybe the X should be placed on the first line of the text, not in the title position.

PS
　I made sure to title it UNNAMED.
