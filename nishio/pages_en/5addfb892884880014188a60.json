Rusantiman Empathic Content
	The type of content that resonates with [lusantiman] will be sympathized with by people who have the same lusantiman
 On the other hand, it's not sympathetic to those in power who don't have lusantimania.
 	On the contrary, you'll be judged as one of the many lusantiman-infected and kept away.
