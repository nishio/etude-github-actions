Grab the slide and go
I want to -> I could [spatial arrangement of slides with laser pointer].

	Movement by Trigger
 	I can think of two ways.
  	Pull the trigger to grab and release to drop
   Trigger click to move mode, click again to put it there.
  I think the former is more natural.
   Distance can be controlled by swiping up and down while grabbing.
   	UI used in [Virtual Virtual Reality
	Trigger will only take one piece, so swipe in front of it to suck out multiple pieces, then spit them out elsewhere #Suck it out
 	The problem of not being able to figure out what has been sucked out of the system.
  	Why not just display it around the controller?
	How to move to another location
  Swipe left or right while grabbing to fly?
  	Users need to remember where anything swiped left or right will jump to.
  breathe in and breathe out
  	Users need to know that they are being sucked out.
