   Lazy work that runs counter to maximum production
   Causes of Failure to Work
   	1: Misconception that increasing efficiency creates unemployment
    	more production means more demand
      [nishio.icon]Really?
     The overuse of workers is easily debated.
     	For every one overworked thing, there are a hundred deliberately not working.
      This is the reason for the low wages.
      [nishio.icon]Is that right?
    2: Imperfect management methods encourage idleness.
    	natural slowdown
     	daily wages
      	If the pay is the same as the slower person, try to work at the same pace as the slower person.
     systematic laziness
     	Work slowly and make it look to the employer as if you are doing it at a considerable speed.
      The employer decides off the top of his head that the daily wage of a bank employee should be at most this much.
      Deception occurs between labor and management.
      When there are those who work hard, others have to work harder for the same wages, so they are restrained from working.
      Keep precise records of the work done by each worker, raise the daily wages of those with good performance, and quit those with poor performance.

   	Develop a science for each element of a foreman's job, and quit the old, eye-rolling way of doing things.
    In the past, workers chose their own jobs and learned as much as they could on their own, but now they must be scientifically selected, trained, educated and developed.
    Management and workers work together to make sure that all work is done in accordance with the principles of developed science.
    Tasks and responsibilities are divided almost equally between managers and line employees.

  Implementation of scientific management methods and their effectiveness
  	knowledge
   	Should the knowledge gained be implemented immediately or wait for the study to be completed?
    	In general, once a certain idea is made, implement and test it as soon as possible.
    Reform is done at a moment's notice.
    	Little by little, slowly.
     One at a time.
     Until that one worker is fully convinced that there is a benefit to the new method, he or she will not work on anything else.
     When 1/4 to 1/3 of the workers are converted to the new method repeatedly, the workers of the old method will see the benefits that the workers of the new method are receiving and will want to join them.
