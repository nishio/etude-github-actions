Reading the Roman alphabet with neural nets
I was talking to my wife about how I did [embedding hiragana and katakana] yesterday, and she suggested that it would be interesting to teach romaji, so I made it.

It is a multilayer perceptron with 4 alphabetic characters as input (embedded in vector and 16 dimensional), 256 and 128 dimensional intermediate layers, and 37 dimensional output with 10 dimensional*3 embedded vector of kana characters, with OneHot for output length and input consumption.

When they don't learn well, it's usually the teacher's fault.

>nishio → nikio
	Nice try Nikio... I hope you at least answer what I taught you...
		The learning data included only Kunrei-style romaji, so "si→shi" was taught, but "shi→shi" was not.

> ni → mi
> shi → ki
> si → ki
> o → Pi
> nisio → nisipi
	You're starting to sound like a high school girl.
	 I wondered why "mikipi" when used individually becomes "nisipi" when connected, and found that the way the training data was created was wrong.
  Initially, the training data was entered as "nish" and the first two letters of "ni" were added randomly after "ni" so that "ni" was returned.
  On the other hand, when testing, if the given string is less than 4 characters long, it is marked "ni$$" with a sentence end marker after it.
  Since "$" is not included in the training data, the first time "$" is seen at the end of a sentence in the test, it causes confusion.
  As a result, the nisipi
  I've also mixed $ into the training data and now I can read nishio properly.

>chopin → Chipin
	I thought it was odd that you could read nishio but not read this as chopin, so I did some research.
 	> chi → chi
  > cha → chichi
  > chu → chichi
  > cho → chichi
  	In the guess result output section, when outputting more than one kana character at a time, I mistakenly repeated the first character, which was an implementation error on my part.

Check if all questions are answered correctly.
	　> du -> du (A: zu)
  > du -> deux (A: deux)
			They were bullying the students by asking the same questions with different answers they were looking for.
   Not sure if it's a "zu" or a "de," so it's interesting to mix them up and make it a "de."
