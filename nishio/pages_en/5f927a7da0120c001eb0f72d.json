　Thoughts.
　　At best 10^6 vertices, at worst 10^3 times processing.
　　If you check every vertex every time, you won't make it in 10^9, but you don't do that.
　　If we do a width-first search, the process will be completed in 10^6 orders of magnitude, which is OK.
　[公式解説OK]
　 I was unconsciously rewriting the problem.
　 For all black squares, if there is a white square adjacent to the black square, it is black" is the same as "For all black squares, if there is a white square adjacent to the black square, it is black
　 [The white square adjacent to the black square is turned to black.]
　 　Sure would have bothered me if I hadn't noticed this rephrasing.
　 　In the latter, once a black square is processed, there are no more white squares around it [and it never needs to be processed again], which is the principle of reduced order.
