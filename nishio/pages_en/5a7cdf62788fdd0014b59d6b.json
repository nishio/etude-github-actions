Thomas Schelling [Dynamic Models of Segregation https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf]
 There are two races.
 If the percentage of shapes that are the same as yours in the 8 squares around you do not fall within a certain range above and below a certain level, you become dissatisfied and move out randomly
 [Racial segregation] conditions occur.
 Surprisingly low thresholds occur, even when moving with less than 33% homogeneity.
  It turns out that "I want to be in the majority" is pretty strong.
 Even if there were no discrimination at all, the current segregation would be maintained.
 Conversely, if you set an "attitude of actively seeking [diversity]" by moving out with a homogeneity ratio of 80% or higher, the isolation status decreases

 It's involved in [knowledge acquisition strategies] in the form of more and more separation as people from the same company get together.
