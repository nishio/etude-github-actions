double-loop learning
The story is that we need not only an optimization loop such as [the PDCA cycle], but also a loop that questions whether the goal of that optimization itself is correct.
A concept proposed by [Chris Argillis] and [Donald Schoen] in [Organizational Learning] in 1978.

> [Single-loop learning] is to solve problems according to a [framework] of ideas and behaviors that you already have in place.
> Double-loop learning means abandoning existing frameworks and incorporating new frameworks of thought and action.
> A concept proposed by American organizational psychologists Chris Argillis and Donald Schoen in 1978 in "[Organizational Learning].
> It is difficult for an organization to survive and adapt to its environment with only single-loop learning.
> Unlearn [stereotypes] in past [successful experiences] by themselves, learn new knowledge and frameworks from the outside in a double-loop learning process, and then repeat and reinforce it again through single-loop learning.
> It is said that only organizations that can continue this cycle repeatedly can maintain [their competitive advantage].
