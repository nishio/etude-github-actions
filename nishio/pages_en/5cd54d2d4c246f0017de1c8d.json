Even one person needs to co-edit.
	What I think about using [co-editable] Scrapbox alone.
	Sometimes edit the same page at the same time from iPhone, iPad or PC
		PC is good at keyboard input.
		iPhone is good at taking pictures with the camera
		iPad+Apple Pencil is good at diagramming
	So co-editing is necessary.
