 I need to reprint the logs I wrote on Twitter as soon as possible, otherwise it will be difficult to look them up later.
 
 Alcohol made NASA paralyzed of motivation. Misconstructions ugh lol - 9:37 PM Jul 8th from TwitterFon

 I'm not sure if the reason it's not crisp is because there is no change in density in the macroscopic view that eliminates the scaling of the squares <img src="http://gyazo.com/efb81ce08906769124d622dd 636d7874.png"> - 11:14 PM Jul 8th from web

 Got out of the bath. Let's do this next: http://d.hatena.ne.jp/j0hn/20081017/1224241667 - 12:21 AM Jul 9th from web
 
 
 I prefer this to the messy original: <img src="http://gyazo.com/3be67d3522da76e35cef7cc63a264384.png"> - 12:34 AM Jul 9th from web
 
 
 Incidentally, the angle of rotation of the circle is 31 degrees (prime number), not the golden angle, and the radius is increasing by 2, and the hue is rotating by 60 degrees. After all, unless the angle of rotation is an integer fraction of 360 degrees, there will be another spiral besides the actual spiral, for example, "(360+)12 degrees if you go forward 12". - 12:39 AM Jul 9th from web
 
 
 It is interesting to note that the spiral changes as the "near side" changes in the middle due to the square root relationship of the radius: the spiral changes.

 This is what happens when you remove the square root of the radius: <img src="http://gyazo.com/3635dd68b0c2c581209bb496db1e1ddb.png"> - 12:45 AM Jul 9th from web
