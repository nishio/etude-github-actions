 I don't like it much.
 
 <hr>
 Fixing the bug of the seven divisions and so on. I was told that it would be easier to understand if I painted the color, so I painted it, but I didn't want people to say "Mondrian? I didn't want people to say "Mondrian?

 I want to draw Penrose tiles. I can draw paths, but each vertex of the path is a coordinate value, so it's a hassle. I should implement turtle graphics.

 Clean clean clean. It's a fundamentally beautiful mathematical structure.

 But it's a little different.

 Trying to get what I wrote in Inkscape to embed directly. Firefox on the left and Inkscape on the right.

 A very unfortunate announcement: Inkscape is renaming gradients arbitrarily. Currently, you have to group parts created with Inkscape and specify the id names in the XML editor, and then open the output SVG of the part and restore the fill information from Inkscape's renamed names. It is not very easy to use.
 
 But well, the synergy of the combination of SVG + Inkscape + Python + lxml is amazing.
 
 **1246545074*Organize leverage memo
 I'm in the process of organizing my notes from various books (leverage memos), which I printed out in A4 size and put in a super-organized notebook, but I dared to leave the back white and use it for notes, so eventually I will need to replace it when the notebook is full. At that time, I will review the text and make changes.
 
 Many times I have had to cut back, leaving only those areas that seem important. Aim." should be "Aim. should be "Aim." and "If Hogehoge ga Fugafuga, then you should do piyo piyo! Then you should do piyo-piyo!" and so on.
 
 <hr>
 I was reading the leverage memo and noticed something I hadn't noticed when I did <a href='http://favotter.matope.com/status.php?id=2368585055'>this</a>, so I'll add this:...
 >>
 Since 90% of everything is junk according to Sturgeon's Law, the statement "This is junk" has only about 1/22 as much information as its negation. However, the statement of a person who always praises has zero information content

 <hr>
 
 I changed "can't start it forever" to "can't start it forever." Shrinkage!
 The term "men in their 30s and 40s" was changed to "men in their 3, 40s."
 
 
 Golf.
 
 
 It is now 8 pages plus 5 lines. Let's print it when we shrink it by 5 more lines.
 
 I'd rather you did." to "I'd rather you did."
 Most of the time, "most of the time," is "most of the time." because it is obvious that it is not 100%.
