generate_karabiner_conf
 I didn't want to edit the Karabiner configuration file by hand, so I wrote a program to generate it.
		2018-08-20 Generate Orz array
	I wanted to use [shio-shift] alone with Karabiner, so I made it so that it can be created in different configuration files 2020-09-19

setup file
	SIMPLE_KEY_CHAINS.txt
 	code:SIMPLE_KEY_CHAINS.txt
 	 a u wo vu
 　Original key, no shift, shift left, shift right
 　? is blank
　SPECIAL.txt
		SIMPLE_KEY_CHAINS.txt is difficult to work with when symbols and shifts are involved, so there is a separate file for symbols.
		code:SPECIAL.txt
			1LEFT ^slash #Hateful
  ^ is shift
 Ideally, it is easy to understand that the data is generated from [keylayout] data
 　I made it and will use it for a while.
