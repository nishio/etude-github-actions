You're still carrying it.

An anecdote about [Zen] monk Hara Tanzan of the Meiji era

> One day they came to a stream without a bridge.
> A young woman stood a short distance away, staring at the stream with a troubled look on her face.
> "I will carry you on my back."
> With the woman on his back, Tangshan stepped into the creek and successfully helped the woman to the other side of the river.
> Then, once on shore, he quickly went on ahead, leaving the woman to thank him.
> 
> Not at all at ease was another fellow trainee who was watching this.
> "What is a Zen monk in training doing carrying a woman on his back?"
> The thought never left my mind, and my anger at Tangshan's actions was forever smoldering.
> It didn't go away for a while after we both started walking again, and the agony continued.
> And eventually I couldn't bear to keep it in my mind, and I opened my mouth in a reproachful way to Flat Mountain.
> "What was that? You are a trainee, aren't you? What was that about giving a young woman a piggyback ride?
> 
> Then Flat Mountain showed a surprised face and immediately started laughing.
> "I put that woman down long ago and you're still carrying her on your back. Ha-ha-ha."
> 
> Which one was [obsessed] with women?
