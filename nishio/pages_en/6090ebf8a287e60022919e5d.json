 Lately, or rather yesterday and today, I wake up at 6:00 in the morning without an alarm.

 Reference++.
 
 Even I, who has never written more than four digits of code in Ruby, know that Ruby has an interactive interpreter called irb. I mean, there are more features that "language X has that language Y doesn't" than people think. If you have a developer with a certain level of expressive power and a certain level of competence, you can incorporate the good points of other languages.
 
 Well, aside from that, if you research the advantages and disadvantages of multiple languages and write a blog about it, there is a very good chance that someone in the know will tell you a lot about it, so everyone should do more multi-language comparisons.
