When MoveFlag is incremented

> Q1: Can MoveFlag move flags to MoveFlag?
> Q2: If MoveFlag has an increment token placed and is at least {2} and the source command has 4 flags placed, can that command be selected as the destination for the other flag?
> Q3: Also, if the above can be done, is it possible to move when there is a deadlock situation where two move source commands are filled with 4 flags and each other chooses the move destination

ã€€The following is a detailed description of the MoveFlag effect.
		1: Choose one command other than this command (X).
		2: Select one flag above X (A)
		3: Choose one command other than X (Y).
		4: Move A to the end of Y.
		5: Repeat 1-4 {1} times.
	Q1: Can I use MoveFlag to move flags to MoveFlag?
		I can do it.
	Q2: When there is an increment token placed on MoveFlag and it is {2} or more, and the source command has 4 flags placed on it, can that command be selected as the destination of the other flag?
		The two moves are done sequentially, so even if X has 4 flags on it at first, if the first run of MoveFlag reduces the number of flags on X to 3, then X can be the destination on the second run.
	Q3: Is it possible to move in a deadlock situation where two move source commands are filled with 4 flags and each chooses the move destination?
		If X and Y each have 4 flags, no move can be made that exchanges X and Y flags.
		The two moves are done sequentially. Note the "first run."
			If X and Y each have 4 flags, then on the first run, neither X nor Y can be chosen as the destination because they already have 4 flags.
