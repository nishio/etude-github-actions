BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation
>Vision-Language Pre-training ([VLP]) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to video-language tasks in a zero-shot manner. Code, models, and datasets are released at this https URL.

roughly speaking
　The approach of "collecting pairs of images on the Internet and their descriptions and using them for training data" is noisy because the descriptions are often not appropriate.
　The proposed method improves the training data by first creating a description from images, comparing it with the description on the Web, and selecting the better one.
