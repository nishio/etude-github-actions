In composing the tree, there is a difference between going from general to special or from special to general.

[Jiro Kawakita] argued that [top-down] data [classification] assumes [existing structure] and hinders the discovery of [new structure]. He emphasized the importance of assembling data [bottom-up] and created the [KJ method].

On the other hand, Buzan's [Mind Map] and Barbara Minto's "The Art of Thinking and Writing" recommend a top-down tree structure.

The card itself is also assembled from the bottom up. First, concrete examples of blind spots that were noticed or perspectives that changed are collected, and then abstractions are made.
