Import from Scrapbox
 API [/help-jp/API]
 I was thinking that we could leave the real-time nature to Scrapbox, but I don't want to have to authenticate with a Google account.

Importing the Whole
 Using all of them is too much quantity.
 I'd like to pick a few and make them less.
 It is appropriate to use links from specific pages
 	[1-hop link] or [2-hop link]

Import in [Regroup] of individual pages
	About [Automatic placement of stickies
	If it's not a bulleted list, then just lay out each line as a sticky note in a lazy row.
 	When you're in a lazy line, you know the left end is next to the right end.
 What is appropriate when there are bullet points?
 What if there are bullets within bullets?
 Consecutive lines should be placed as close together as possible.
 	Blank lines need not exist as stickies.
			(or the degree to which they want to be placed nearby is weakened by the number of empty lines).
 Tree parents and children want to be placed close together
 I'd like to be placed near my tree siblings as well.

Import from Scrapbox
 　First, I added the ability to make a sticky with a non-empty line.
 　I really want to keep some of the original structure.
			Import with Scrapbox URL
 　I was going to do Regroup directly from the export tool, but I think I'll just go through Scrapbox.
 　　[Filling in Regroup from Export Tool]
		I want to merge instead of creating a new one.
		　After spatial placement of imported items from Scrapbox
		　　Write back to Scrapbox
		　　Re-import changes on Scrapbox
 	A distinction should be made between the auto-placement state immediately after import and the state after subsequent layout.
 		If it's already in place when you reimport, you don't have to move it, and you don't have to add it.
 		Should I use line permalinks to determine identity if I'm reading from Scrapbox?
 		It would be nice to be able to delete all the imported but not moved items at once.
