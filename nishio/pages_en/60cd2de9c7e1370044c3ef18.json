Losing motivation to defeat your delusional self.
[Duolingo]の雑談

I started Korean as "I have tried to learn to read Hangul, but I can't remember the difference between vowels", but I'm making progress very slowly at a "better than nothing" rate.
Maybe if you have the feeling in your mind that you should be going at this speed in school, NHK radio, etc., you may lose [motivation] for being too slow compared to that.
I'm not diligent, so I don't study other things, so I only have [my past self] to compare myself to, and when I compare myself to my past self, I can say, "I understand more now than before," so maybe that keeps me positive.

　The original title was "Speed Comparison," but after a while of writing it, it was changed to "Losing motivation to [my delusional self]."

　[the difference between "aiming at a certain point" and "going in a certain direction"].
　　The difference between continuing to progress in the way you learn a little about the language and aiming for a delusional "fluent-speaking self".
　　Metaphorically speaking, aiming for a "self that can continue to learn" is also aiming for a point.
