　Thoughts.
　　Since the rotation is 90 degrees, the problem can be split into two independent problems in the x-axis and y-axis directions by splitting the problem with a rotation instruction.
　　　[divide into X and Y].
　　The part followed by the forward instruction can be replaced by a number.
　　Given a set of numbers, the problem is to add or subtract them to a desired value.
　　How do you solve this...
　　 At worst, there are 2000 numbers, there can be 2^2000 different expressions.
　　When there are many identical numbers, they can be processed together.
　　　Example, when there are 100 1s, the reachable range is an even number from -100 to 100
　Official Explanation
　　You are right to divide it into X and Y.
　　The range of possible values is 16000 and the number of steps is 2000, so it is possible to DP in time.
　　The division into X and Y makes N^2 become 2N.
