Justice does violence.
When people gain the belief that they are [righteous], they are confident enough to commit [violence] against others.

It seems that the "JK who bought a car" incident itself was a hoax, but the mass hysteria that often occurs on Twitter, such as "there are no/few people who say "dis-dis-dis", but there are a large number of people who criticize those who say "dis-dis"," gives the feeling of a witch hunt in the 21st century.
