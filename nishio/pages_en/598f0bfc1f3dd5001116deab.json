 [Kinta Nakayama] "A Framework for Decision-Making, Execution, and Evaluation, which is Missing in [Lean Startups]" #Decision-making Frameworks

	Lean's MVP (minimum verifiable product) concept was unclear as to "how big is smallest," and there was a problem that if the risk tolerance of the person making the decision to release the product was low, the product could become sneaky and large.
 The method described in this book, simply put, is "6 hours x 5 days, 30 hours [time box]" to validate the MVP.
  Prevent unlimited growth by limiting time resources.
  The program starts at 10:00 and ends at 17:00, with a one-hour lunch in between, and breaks in between for the first three hours and the second three hours, respectively.
  P72 More prolonged sprints were also experimented with but were not effective
   Distractions due to intervening weekends
   Taking the time to do this makes you more attached to your ideas and makes it harder to learn from your customers.
 In addition, by limiting the number of man-hours consumed before determining the success or failure of a project to "7 people x 5 days," it becomes easier to negotiate to invest that in experimentation.
  It is difficult to approve a project that may suck up unlimited resources, but it is easier to GO if the criteria for suspension are clear.

 P59 Example of an industrial pump; it is not even possible to build a product prototype in five days.
  Think about what can be done in 5 days by reversing the process.
  We can measure customer response with brochures, experiment with just the nozzle part with a 3D printer, and so on.
 P76 Importance of enough whiteboards, human short-term memory is not very good, so turn to spatial memory
  IDEO CEO Tim Brown, in "Design Thinking is Changing the World," says that having a list of project documents allows for quick pattern spotting and encourages creative [synthesis].
  Two movable whiteboards can be used for partitions.
