Docker for Mac
Using Chainer on a Mac is not supported, and I decided to use Docker because of the hassle of porting it when I want to run it on a server after I've created something.

$ brew install docker
$ brew cask install docker
$ docker run -p 8888:8888 --name ml -it asashiho/ml-jupyter-python3
	[Docker is useful when studying machine learning - Asa's Alone http://dr-asa.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/08/21/185301]
 https://hub.docker.com/r/asashiho/ml-jupyter-python3/~/dockerfile/
	When executed, Jupyter Notebook starts up.
 After Ctrl-C, the container does not disappear, but is stopped.
 	$ docker start /ml
  $ docker exec /ml pwd
  /notebooks

If you want to access data files, results files, etc. from the outside, Bind mounts instead of Volumes seems to be the way to go.

$ docker run -p 8888:8888 --name ml -it --mount type=bind,source=/Users/nishio,target=/notebooks/home asashiho/ml-jupyter-python3

memo
	Chainer is not included.
	pip is old
 	You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
		# pip install --upgrade pip
	I'll be about 30% slower.
