Elf and Inheritance Tax
[elf] and [estate tax].

The High Elves can invest their assets without inheritance tax and with infinite compound interest in a single generation. ...... Over time, all capital will be concentrated in the Elves. This is far more frightening than a bad cheat skill. A world where capitalists, money lenders and banks are all monopolized by the Elves.

I'm not sure if it's a story about a [corporation] or something that lasts forever without dying. I think that [corporation] will never die and all the assets will belong to the corporation in the end.
