accumulate
 "[The only way to go to a great place is] to accumulate small things." [Ichiro].
 Continuously pouring resources is a prerequisite for significant [deviation] from the average.
  Requires a large amount of money or strong enthusiasm to keep pouring resources
  Money buys weak enthusiasm from others and pours it in.
  Given that, the resource needed here is "[enthusiasm]."
 A necessary but not sufficient condition
 	The expected value of divergence is very different between repeatedly going in a fixed direction and repeating a [random walk].
		In a two-dimensional random walk and a random walk that rejects when x is not going in the positive direction, the latter will have a larger x
  	What probability of rejection would result in the same degree of deviation from the mean?
		The distribution of deviations from the mean in the absence of rejection is [chi-square distribution].
