Diary 2022-05-20
A sigh of relief after [Study Session 4 of "Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning"].
　I'll watch the recording next week and add to it.

No need to put a "diary" tag on the diary page.
　All you have to do is search.

I was tired or suddenly sick and slept from 5-7am.
　(Some believe it is simply lack of sleep.)
　I wasn't aware of it, but the temperature changes were so drastic this week that I thought my autonomic nervous system might have been compromised. (According to my wife)
　 Well, I'm sure it's falling apart when you're not sleeping as much as you should be.

I lay there for a while after dinner, but I'm feeling much better, 9pm.

I'd write directly on the well what I thought might grow if I spread the seed on the well, but it doesn't grow, or I'd forget to transcribe it later and it just sinks, what a waste!
　Seeds planted [/villagepump/where you can communicate without worrying about spoilers].
In shared spaces, pages can mysteriously decrease
　[/villagepump/mystery of declining well pages].
　The "backup to a local file system or private project" I wrote here should be taken rather seriously.
