 *1273495568*[Kaizen] Absentee ballot at post office.
 I tried to pick up a package when I was not at the post office, but for some reason it took so long. The reason was that the attendant looked for the mail using the old address on the front of my driver's license, not the absentee slip. I'll tell them that my address has changed next time.
