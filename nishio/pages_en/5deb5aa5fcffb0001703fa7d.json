Change URL structure
Change URL structure
	I had forgotten all about it because I was the only one who used it before, but before other users used it.
		It needs to be changed to `#/<user>/<mapName>/<options>` or something like that.
	Actually, while I was using it on my own, the system granted editing privileges when the map name ends in EDIT.
		`#/<mapName>edit`
		This implementation needs to stop before sharing editable links to others.
	I had the above thoughts as of July, but changed my mind when I looked back in December.
		`#/key=<key>`
			Unless you need to put the hierarchical structure in the URL, avoid it.
			I don't need to put the user in the URL, same idea as [Gyazo].
			Not "easy-to-understand URLs," but since it's unclear that easy-to-understand is really necessary, simplicity is the priority.
			Actually, you don't even need `key=`, but it's a combination of existing URLs.
		Readonly and other settings can be made on the object pointed to by key.
			For example, if you have given an edit permission link to an inappropriate person, you can remove the key from the DB.
			In the future, it would be nice to be able to [freeze changes], etc.

			It is difficult to [view a list of maps you have created].
				I'll think about this when I need it.
