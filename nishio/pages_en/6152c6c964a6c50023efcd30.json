FAQ
 Q: Wheel zooms in and out too quickly
 A: 
 	The wheel and touchpad have different appropriate sensitivities, and Kozaneba is set by default for the touchpad.
 　It would be best if it could detect when a user is using the wheel and switch, but I am not sure how.
 　This identification function is named `kozaneba.is_touchpad` and is customizable, so if you are interested, please experiment with it.
 　If you are not interested in the identification method, and you are fine with the judgment that it is always "not a touchpad" because you use a wheel, you can use `kozaneba.is_touchpad = () => false;`.

　2021-09-16, "Add the ability to pull arrows together in a user script."
　On 2021-09-17, "Added to the menu because of the frequency of use of the double-headed arrows," and "Also, the menu for adding arrows up to now clearly states that the right one is the head."
　　These three have been transformed into a menu of images.
