(5.4.2) Trigger to repeat
It is valuable to repeat the KJ method. However, to people who are starting the KJ method from now on, saying "you should repeat it" makes the [goal] ambiguous and far away. It is not good. You do not have to repeat from the beginning. For example, if you are making a presentation, the goal is to finish the slides and publish it.

If you publish the slide on the Internet, you may be asked to give a lecture or write an article for a magazine. The project of this book starts with those [trigger]s. 

It is not limited to large projects. If you publish the slide on the Internet, other people can mention it. It triggers you to recall the slide. The frequency of the [social trigger] is higher as the [social value] of the slide is higher.

When you see your output is mentioned, you read it again, and you may want to re-organize it. The feeling is a chance to do the KJ method again.
