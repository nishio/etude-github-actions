	>[For those who live by the value of "text = stock communication"], if it doesn't look like stock communication, it won't be valued, and TEAMS is optimizing against this.
	>[chat] to a subtle design for digital natives who want flow communication.


	>Because the UI is of a culture that wants DMs to fly by the seat of their pants, I think it's a good tool to take traditional internal politics and slide it along with it.
	> teams is a very good UI, better email to migrate the company with the existing email culture as it is.
 	>However, the UI is extremely difficult to use for a company that already has a chat culture
