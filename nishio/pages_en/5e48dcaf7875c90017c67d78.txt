Multiplication doesn't work.
code:ts
  type m_MUL<
    REV_N extends DIGITS,
    REV_M extends DIGITS,
    POWER extends DIGITS | [],
    > = (
      ADD<
        mm_MUL<REV_N, REV_M[0], POWER>,
        {
          0:
  
          m_MUL<REV_N, REV_M[1], [0, POWER]>,
          // Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
  
          1: [0, []]
        }[REV_M[1] extends DIGITS ? 0 : 1]
      >
    )
