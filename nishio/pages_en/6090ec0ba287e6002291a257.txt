 *1344051762* Participating in the 18th Unexplored Results Report Meeting
 <a href='http://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/2011/2011_1/seikahoukokukai/'>Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan: Unexplored: FY2011: "18th Unexplored Project" Results Report Meeting</a> We are here. This time, I have created a public group on Facebook, which is quite nice; it is friendly to people who read it later because it allows a thread for each presentation without having to put in the effort like on Togetter.
 
 Groups are here: <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/104276283052914/'>18th Unexplored Results Reporting Conference</a>.
 
 You can post links to individual threads (<a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/104276283052914/permalink/104300506383825/'>Development of a compiler for the programming language egison </a> and so on), and links posted in threads become thumbnails, which is useful in many ways.
 
 The only problem is that "you can't write without joining the group". We approve participation applications as soon as we notice them, but it seems to be difficult to notice that you can't write without joining the group. Please feel free to join the group even if you are not at the venue, so please feel free to click the "join" button.
 
 Now if only there was a mechanism to automatically repost posts to this group to Twitter, but I haven't found a handy way to do that yet.

 Project map to clay. I copied the shape of the first one I put down, and since it shows things that are too bulky, I can cut off that part to get the same shape. If the accuracy is good enough, I can copy the shape of the figure and customize a part of it to my taste, or combine it with other characters. My dreams are expanding.

 *1344092000*Vicon Revue Good and bad points.
 I've only been using it for a week and I'm still a newbie. I have prepared an entry to write about the good and bad points and will add to it as soon as I think of something.
 
 ** Bad Points
 - I think you went overboard with the 2048x1536 resolution.
 - I think there is about a second of the process of recording the results of the camera shot, and I think there is a refractory period of buttons for some or all of it. Manual shutter operation is poor.
 - It takes 23 minutes to copy a day's worth of 3800 photos to disk and 7 minutes to convert them to video. By the way, the image size is 1.15 GB.
 - The USB connection contact is bad, or it does not connect or disconnects on its own.
 - A little over 30,000 yen is expensive.
 - What is the advantage of paying more than four times as much when <a href='http://www.kingjim.co.jp/sp/recolo_ir5/'>Recoro, an interval recorderï½œKING JIM</a> can be bought for 7,000 yen? (However, Recoro "can continuously take about 2,000 pictures at 3-second intervals or 365 pictures at 24-hour intervals with two AA batteries," so the batteries will run out in a few hours.)
 - Someone might be offended that it's voyeurism.
 - On a Mac, in some cases the drive doesn't show up on the desktop, but it's still successfully connected. I thought it wasn't connected, so I unplugged and unplugged it several times. It was blinking green. I should look at /Volumes.
 
 ** Good points
 - I can reevaluate my behavior. I got angry at myself for spending time on the train to work on the first day doing silly things like Twitter, so I got ready to study English with podcasts and read e-books, and my time on the train to work on the second day and beyond was better utilized.
 - I was bored with the lack of change in my videos while I was at my computer at work, so I wanted to change the way I commuted to work from time to time to give it some variety.
 - There are rumors that it enhances recall and image memory, but my experience has not yet been verified.
 - Even if it leads to an improvement in ability, it has not been tested whether it also accelerates, for example, recalling what one has read in a paper, or whether it accelerates the speed at which one reads or understands.
 - I get asked about the battery a lot, but I've never run out anyway.
 - It has a fisheye lens so the angle of view is wide (but there are fisheye lens attachments for cell phone cameras for sale, so why not buy one?)
 - There's a manual shutter button that takes pictures on the initiative and a privacy button that stops taking pictures for a while.
