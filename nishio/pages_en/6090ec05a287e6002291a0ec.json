 Mmmm, I thought of course I could refer to it, but I couldn't. Why not?
 
 <hr>

 @miyagawa It's a warning, so you should be able to reference it. The meaning of warning is that it is not a closure because it becomes a different variable on the second and subsequent calls. see perldoc perldiag

 Thank you! I was blinded by the warning and didn't realize it was showing up.

 @miyagawa perl -e 'sub foo { my $x = 1; sub bar { warn $x++ } bar() } foo() for 1..3' to see what will not stay shared

 <hr>
 my $bar = ... my $foo = sub{...} creates a function object and binds it to the lexical scope name $foo, but the sub foo{...} syntax seems to bind the created function object somewhere else. It did not seem to be a global scope, but it is out of the scope of the lecture material I am preparing now, so I will avoid going too deep into it.

 Then a demonstration of dynamic scope.
