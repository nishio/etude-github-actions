Reading the network display

There was a discussion about wanting to know what a non-creator would read when they see the Interactive Graph displayed on a page that [/villagepump/Quartz publishes Obsidian Vault].

　Two things caught my attention after seeing this
	[https://gyazo.com/68a8e980bb3805f530d7b67b76b97ad6]
　I thought it was interesting to compare each page and see the differences.
		A is a raw writing that has been written in a flow state for an interesting thought topic
		B is a sentence that has been cut out and polished clean
		I got the impression that
	I felt that B was created by abstraction ([abstraction product])
　Is B easy to understand?
　　This depends on the state of knowledge of the recipient.

　　from [how to give knowledge to those who lack knowledge].
　　Understanding X, a product of abstraction, requires knowledge to support it
　　　You can't understand it if you're given just X with no knowledge of it.
			[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected].

　So if you read B in this case and don't understand it, maybe you should read A and then read it again.

　　　The graph visualizes [the path to] X, making it easier to find.
　　Ideally, you'd read all the pages surrounding B and then re-read B to better understand it.

　　　But this is high cost

Expressions in a different order
　Suppose we want to understand some abstract concept X
　　Ideally, you'd read all the surrounding pages before reading it to better understand it.

 　　But this is high cost
 　So read [the road map leading] to X.

 　Graphical visualization made it easier to find.



　Tend to think of pages that are linked from many concepts as "important pages" in the PageRank metaphor
　　But it's often "[a highly abstracted page]"
　　Because [concepts with higher levels of abstraction have a wider range of applications], they combine with more
　　Increased abstraction does not equal good.
　　　[Jiro Kawakita.icon][Don't abstract too much].
　　　The process of abstraction to the minimum necessary is important.
　　　　This sentence is about "in the writer's thinking process"
　　　　I'm not talking about "for informational purposes."
　　　　Abstract concepts are easily communicated or misunderstood, but they have no choice [books are already a product of abstraction], because readers are not used to having the process shared with them.
