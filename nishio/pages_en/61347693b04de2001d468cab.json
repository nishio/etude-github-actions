Disregard what you already know.
[Aging Policy]
When others don't know something you already know, you think, "That's no big deal," and when they know something you don't know, you say, "I didn't know! Thank you for telling me.

Perhaps this is important.
If you're not careful, you'll end up with a bias that emphasizes what you know and downplays what you don't know, rather than the right balance.
