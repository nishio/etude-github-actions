Performance variance and selection thresholds
The first half of what I said in [How to come up with good ideas] at [Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15k-sLm55P04_HGVzHFe9-mpHUlG2-BhT].

Those with high performance variance have an 81% higher win rate than those with low variance in threshold competitions where only the top 1/4 win, but a 17% lower pass rate in tests where the bottom 1/4 flunk. [New product development] and competitions in general are situations similar to the former, while [school tests] are situations similar to the latter.
