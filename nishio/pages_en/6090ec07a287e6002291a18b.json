 *1307535139*"After 30, I memorized 3000 words English vocabulary memorization system" Day 2 Diary
 Previous Article
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110607/1307450595'>I started the "After 30, I memorized 3000 words English vocabulary memorization system"</a>.
 
 ** Physical placement
 I wonder how they manage it physically. I left yesterday with a pile of them on the corner of my desk, but I decided to color the sides with a pen to distinguish them and put them through the ring, since this is a "flag that I will drop and squish them until a month from now and stop being sad" for all intents and purposes. I meant to post a picture but forgot to take it.
 
 **Measurement and Improvement
 Today's measured data: 7.5 minutes for 53 tests; OK 41 NG 12
 
 I saw that the back of "autonomy" said "the right or condition of self-government" and thought "dictatorship?" I added a card for "despotism" because I misunderstood it. The right or condition of self-government is self-government. intrigue has two meanings, intrigue and intriguing, but the English on the back only says the intrigue side. I'll split this into intrigue someone and intrigue against someone. For the other cards, add Japanese on the reverse side, and vice versa. Add information from a different point of view to make it easier to get caught in the brain's web. For example, I saw "especially" on the back of "not least" and it didn't feel right, but when I looked it up on OALD, it said "especially" and I thought that was a better choice. I thought it would be better to use "especially".
 
 OALD is free to use: <a href='http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/'>Free online dictionary definitions for learners of English | Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</a>.
 
 I dare not make the "effort" of "writing repeatedly" or "pronouncing the words over and over again" because it is a pain in the ass. It's too much trouble. For now, I'm trying to measure how far I can go by working to satisfy my desire to "know" and "improve". I'm lazy, yes.
 
 1 pomodoro in the process so far; 12 cards left and 2 added, so 14 cards left.
 
 **Target Update
 If 41 out of 53 cards are successful, that means that the percentage of correct answers after one day is about 80%. That means that tomorrow, I will test 14 sheets and fail 2 or 3 sheets. Since the percentage of correct answers will increase due to the smaller number of sheets tested, it will be easy to achieve the goal of "emptying the study pile within a week".
 
 - We'll do it again tomorrow.
 - Empty the mountain you are studying within a week" - I have a good idea of how easy it will be to accomplish this.
 - "I'll try to remember to review 6/15"?
 
 The goal of "remembering" is not appropriate. What can be done to increase the success rate of "remember to do the 6/15 review? What can I do to increase the success rate of "remember to review 6/15"? I forget to look at it even if I put it in RememberTheMilk. I have been neglecting my notebook for a long time without maintaining it (bad person). I need a place to accumulate information that I must look at once a day. And, it is a lifehack to write down what I should not forget there so that I can remember it. Currently, I don't have an RTM or a notebook, but I see the schedule of Cybozu in my office on weekdays. I should write it down here. I'll have to get into the habit of using this as a bootstrap to check my notebook or RTM, since I don't have much to share...
 
 Postscript. I read one pomodoro's worth of English papers, which I had been meaning to read for a while but had been too lazy to do so. I looked up words I didn't understand in the dictionary, so I wrote them down on a vocabulary card. I'll add more tomorrow or the next day when my "study pile" is empty.
 
 **Discovery of failure
 Yesterday I had written this:.
 >>
 For now, "I'll test tomorrow and measure the time. I'll put the ones I got right in my review pile in two days." I'll put the ones I got right in the review pile two days later. I'm going to review in 2 days, then 4 days, then 1 week, and so on.
 <<
 I completely forgot and put the card that passed the test today on my review schedule for a week from now. I thought I'd forget to do it a week later, so I decided to do it two days later. I forgot already.

 <BODY>Physical locations are distributed in 5 places. <BR><BR>- Three pockets in the bag<BR>- Two boxes in the closet<BR><BR>- In the bag, the most recently needed items<BR><BR>- Pocket 1: A pile to draw from for today<BR>- Pocket 2: Items learned up to yesterday that I am not yet confident about<BR>- Pocket 3: Items completely learned up to yesterday. When you have accumulated a certain amount of material, put a cover sheet on it, write the date of review, put the ring through it, and put it in box 1 or box 2. <br><br><br>Box 1: A pile of vocabulary books with a cover that shows the date to review. <br><br>Box 2: A collection of items from Box 1 that need to be reviewed in the last 15 days, sorted by date. When I wake up each morning, I take out from there today's minutes, if any, and review them. <br>I import from box 1 on the 1st/15th of each month<br><br>and so on. <BR><BR>I wish I hadn't written this anywhere since I established it after I wrote that journal. Let's exchange information next time! </body>

 <body>I see! So does that mean you've bought a lot of rings separate from your vocabulary book? </body>
