>Proposal 1: "Link to Facebook Private Group"
	>Traditional books have not provided opportunities for readers to meet other readers and discuss the book's content. Some books provide opportunities for readers to get together and discuss the book to further deepen their understanding of the book's content by "holding a commemorative event" or "organizing a book reading group. However, even in this way, opportunities for participation are scarce for people in rural areas, and this could be achieved at low cost in the form of creating a Facebook group. This group could also serve as a catalyst to organize physical book readings. I think this is a useful challenge to increase the probability of this book becoming a long seller.
>Proposal 2 "Link to Scrapbox Private Project"
	>Books are a one-dimensional series of sentences, but knowledge has a network structure. If the contents of books are placed on Scrapbox, an information sharing tool that can handle this network structure, and then networked and connected with additional information, etc., it would be a very good nursery for intellectual production. It would also be beneficial for future reprints, revisions, and expansions. It would be more interesting to do it as a public project, but I am thinking of making it a private project, accessible only to the purchaser, as I am sure there would be objections to having all of the book's content available online.
