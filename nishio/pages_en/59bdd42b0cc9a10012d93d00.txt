The Dilemma of Knowledge Use and Acquisition
Demand for the use of knowledge is concentrated on those who know the most (this itself has its own detailed conditions, but let's put them aside for now).
So in order to increase the efficiency of using one's knowledge to create value, one needs to become "the person who knows best. This is often said.
On the other hand, when considering the efficiency of acquiring knowledge, it is better to be around people who know more than you do than to be the best.
I was trying to figure out how to solve this dilemma.

If one organization A is best in field X and second or lower in field Y, and another organization B is best in field Y and second or lower in field X, then both organizations would benefit from being the best and second or lower in both. So one of the reasons that belonging to multiple organizations is beneficial is the efficiency of knowledge acquisition & utilization.

There is no "most knowledgeable person" without limiting the field.
[someone with a lot of knowledge teaches].
[Learn from someone with little knowledge].
