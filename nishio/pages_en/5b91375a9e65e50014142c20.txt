	I'm thinking of adding an Appendix to a future edition of "The Intellectual Production of Engineers" that says "[having legal knowledge is beneficial]" and I think it would be quite interesting as a practical example to introduce in the Appendix.
	Keisuke Sogawa I feel that not only legal knowledge but also money literacy, economics, and engineering + Î± will expand the scope of problem solving
 Of course, it is true that the value of knowledge increases when it is combined with knowledge from other fields, but my point is not so much about the law in general, but rather, "Isn't it bad that we live by selling the products of intellectual production, but we don't understand the legal basis on which those products are protected? Something like that.
 In that light, it's not "it's beneficial to have legal knowledge," but "how are the rights to intellectual productions protected?" would be more appropriate.
