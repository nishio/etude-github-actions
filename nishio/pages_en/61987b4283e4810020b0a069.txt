Is it a contrarian value to avoid a sense of seriousness?
Humans have "the desire to be considered a significant person by others," and [Laozhuang Thought] tells us that "it is not good to be pleased with being considered a significant person by others" (e.g., the first half of the [Gengsang Chu] chapter).

It is not equal to let go after having gained "[a sense of seriousness]" as Lao Tzu did, and to consider it unnecessary without having gained it. The latter may be [sour grapes] or [contrarian values].
