Chatbots are stationery

	Interesting discussion, but comparing coaching chatbots to human coaching feels misplaced. Chatbots are "[stationery] for output alone without [a live person]," and the comparison is paper and pen. When you think, "Let's write and think," you can either write from scratch or answer a question
		>However, questions that encourage reflection in coaching are generally "hard to think about" and are often not deep enough to be asked by a bot. It is only when someone is there to put "pressure" on them that they are finally squeezed out.
	The consideration that there is "pressure" on the human coach and that it is necessary for it to function effectively is interesting and not particularly objectionable. On the other hand, whether it is good for stationery to have pressure is another story, and being different from humans creates new uses, such as using it while bathing, or when you wake up late at night with an idea
	I agree 100% with the idea that new insights come from [good stagnation] and that it is important to answer questions that cannot be answered immediately, but there is more fruit for me if I take the time to answer such questions, rather than trying to control the user with "pressure" on how to achieve that The policy is to make the user understand that
	So we are back to the first point. Chatbots are stationery, not humans, so it is natural to teach users how to use chatbots in a way that is likely to create value, and then have users agree to use chatbots in that way. It is not a good idea for stationery to try to control the user's usage.
