	contract theory
 	>Contract theory is a microscopic theory that focuses on contracts, which are agreements between parties to transactions of goods and services, and explains phenomena that arise because of the costs involved in concluding and managing the performance of contracts, differences in the information held by the contracting parties (Hidden Information), imperfect mechanisms for monitoring the performance of contracts (Hidden Action), and limited ability to process information (Limited Rationality). It is a microscopic theory that explains the phenomena that arise when the parties to a contract have different information (Hidden Information), the mechanism to monitor the performance of the contract is incomplete (Hidden Action), or the ability to process information is limited ([Limited Rationality]).

			[Reverse Selection]
   	[Lemon Market]
    The seller knows the quality of the goods.
    Buyers do not know the quality of goods
    Buyers are only willing to pay for average quality.
    Seller does not produce good quality goods
    Only the worst quality products will be distributed.

			signalling
    [Signalling (economics) - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)]
    Signaling in the Job Market
    	'I got into college and graduated' signals competence.
   screening
   	Unlike signaling, the side with less information is considered a strategy to fight information asymmetry
    In hiring salespeople, employers with little information offer low fixed and commission wages.
     People who know they are not capable of doing well are no longer avoiding percentage pay.
