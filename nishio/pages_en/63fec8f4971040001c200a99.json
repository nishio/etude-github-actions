AI Baltasar Gracian Experiment
Have [GPT3] read [The Art of Worldly Wisdom] by [Baltasar Gracián] at [LlamaIndex].
　I really want to let people read this Scrapbox of mine, or data that is not on the internet (my book or someone else's book).
　However, the GPT3 tokenizer is currently not very suitable for handling Japanese ([information density is inverted in GPT3]).
　So I'm going to do it in English.

 documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('data').load_data()
 index = GPTSimpleVectorIndex(documents)

Response
>It is important to be aware of the power of first impressions, as they can often shape how we view a situation or person. It is also important to be aware of our own faults and to take steps to address them, as this can help us to become better people. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the power of words and to use them wisely, as they can have a lasting impact on those around us. Finally, it is important to be aware of the power of kindness and to use it to our advantage, as it can help us to build strong relationships with those around us. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the power of subtle policy and to grant favours before they are deserved, as this can be a proof of being obliging. Furthermore, it is important to never share the secrets of your superiors, as this can have serious consequences.
>(DeepL)It is important to be aware of the power of first impressions, as they can influence how we view a situation or person. It is also important to be aware of one's shortcomings and to improve upon them in order to become a better person. Furthermore, it is important to be aware of the power of words and to use them wisely. The power of words can have a lasting impact on those around us. Finally, being aware of and harnessing the power of kindness helps us build strong relationships with those around us. Furthermore, being aware of the power of subtle policy and giving before receiving is important because it is evidence of ingratitude. Furthermore, it is important never to divulge a superior's secrets, as this can have serious consequences.

I'm reading from `ccxvi Be Expressive.` to `ccxxxvii Never Share the Secrets of your Superiors.` (216~237)
　The original is a collection of aphorisms, so if you try to summarize it, it's just a series of short stories.
　The query, "Say something funny," is a mess.
　Let's try something a little more question-like.

[** poses a question that did not exist at all in Gracian's time].

Although it may not always be correct, it can be a valuable source of inspiration and can help to stimulate new thought processes and ideas.

>Wisdom is the ability to think deeply and critically about difficult topics, to recognize and understand the complexities of a situation, and to make decisions based on sound judgment and experience. It is the ability to use knowledge and experience to make informed decisions and to act in a way that is beneficial to oneself and to others. Wisdom also involves understanding the consequences of one's actions and being able to recognize when it is necessary to take a different course of action. Additionally, wisdom involves the ability to adapt oneself to one's company, to employ no more force than is necessary, and to recognize that excellence and achievement are the only foundations for immortality.

It is the ability to use knowledge and experience to make informed decisions and act in ways that are beneficial to oneself and others.

I'm reading around here with similarity=0.82, good.

For a set of fragmented texts such as [The Art of Worldly Wisdom], I think it would be better to source each fragment separately so that similarity searches can pick up only what is truly relevant.
　Read the documentation on how to create an index!

[** Cost].
A note on costs
　Davinci is $0.02 for 1000 tokens, or about $3
　70000 tokens for indexing, [- ¥210]4
　Indexing was cheaper because it was Ada [embedding was $0.4 / 1M Token].
　English 278KB
　4,000 tokens per question, 12 yen
　Note: ChatGPT Plus is a $20/month subscription
　　Save 250 exchanges per month.
　　A pretty good line
　　Before I started touching GPT3 directly, I would definitely have used that much, but when I wanted to get more creative, I hit GPT3 directly, so I use ChatGPT less often for that...
　　The advantage of ChatGPT is that it automatically titles and saves logs, and the chat-style UI is convenient to use from a smartphone.
　　I'll put Keichobot's chat UI over [LangChain]...

[** split and read element by element].
code:py
 documents = StringIterableReader().load_data([

By the way, similarity is determined here.

code:py
   items = self._data.embedding_dict.items()
   node_ids = [t[0] for t in items]
