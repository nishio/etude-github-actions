 *1273191909* Heavy talk?
 There are so many examples of the same kanji overlapping the object and verb. I noticed that <a href='http://tadashiinihongo.appspot.com/item/9HKVe/'>"eating breakfast"</a> is <a href='http://tadashiinihongo.appspot.com/item/MONgm/'>"feeling uncomfortable I noticed that <a href=''>"I feel uncomfortable"</a> when it was pointed out in the comments section, but it is indeed very subtle. I was chatting with a normal person yesterday, and what the heck? <a href='http://tadashiinihongo.appspot.com/item/4KPqJ/'>"I'm going on a trip"</a> is a heavy word? I posted it.
 
 *1273236672* Leverage memo on Drucker's Post-Capitalist Society Part I.
 In the past, workers owned the means of production, which was labor. Inventions such as the steam engine created costly but overwhelmingly productive machines, and the time came when the means of production were owned by capitalists who could afford the machines. This was the result of the application of knowledge to the tools of work. Taylor's invention of scientific management methods and the education and training of workers increased productivity. This was the result of the application of knowledge to the manual laborer's job. Just as in the past, capitalists who owned machines were considered to own the means of production because "labor power < < labor power + machines," in the future, workers with knowledge will own the means of production because "labor power + machines < < labor power + machines + knowledge.

 Perhaps this is still only one of about five important stories. The first part, "What is an organization?", the second part, "Politics", and the third part, "Knowledge", are completely omitted from the book.
 
 *1273240407* Drucker's Post-Capitalism Leverage Memo 2
 >>
 I wonder if you realize that the Druckerbot's "knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates" is full of RTs, but it is a state where no one is above you in the organization as a result of constant learning and advanced expertise (and those who cannot do that have already been restructured).
 <<
 
 So I summarized the surrounding area. Some of the detailed wording has been omitted.
 
 
 Modern organizations are organizations of knowledge experts. Thus an organization by equals. No knowledge is ever higher than any other knowledge." p. 76
 You have to acquire new knowledge every four or five years in any field, or you will be obsolete. Otherwise, you will become obsolete.
 Knowledge workers cannot be supervised. Rather, he is useless in every sense of the word if there is anyone who knows more about his specialty than he does.

 So those who feel like they have eaten meat by eating minced Drucker meat detached from its context are useless and subject to restructuring in the knowledge society. You have to cover yourself with hard meat and strengthen your jaw to survive.
