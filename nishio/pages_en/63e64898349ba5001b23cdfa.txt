　[What is the origin of recognition?]
　　Is truth known by experience or by thought?
　　This is "[the] problem of the origin of recognition."
　　The "problem of the origin of perception" occurred before "[what is] truth" in history.
　　 Before discussing what truth is, a debate arose as to whether truth is known through experience? [/villagepump/base.icon].
　　 So[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　 Kitaro Nishida (1870-1945) explains[/villagepump/] that even in the time of [Kant](1724-1804), the question of "what truth is" was still vague, and that the epistemology of [Locke](1632-1704) preceded it, even though what truth is is a more fundamental question. nishio.icon]
		[Locke was the first to systematically discuss [epistemology].
		Locke's problem was primarily one of perceived origin.
		There are three positions depending on how you think about the origin of recognition
 		[Empiricism]
 		[Rationalism]
 		[Mysticism]([intuitionism])

What is rationalism?
　Empiricism and just the opposite position
　Believes that [true knowledge] is given from within by [reason
　The foundation of rationalism was laid by [Plato].
　　[Knowledge] was divided into [knowledge by perception] and [knowledge by reason
　　[Knowledge by perception] varies from person to person and from time to time, so it is not [truth].
　　Truth must be found from within ourselves through reason.
　　What exactly do we do?
　　　[Recall of Ideas]
　　In today's terms, [the idea of identity] is a category ([category]).
　[Descartes' conception of the real instrument is also analogous to Plato's [Idea].
　From [Descartes] [Spinoza] and [Leibniz] derived
　Leibniz was the most thorough [rationalist].
　　[The New Theory of Human Enlightenment" is a critique of Locke's "Theory of Human Enlightenment" from the standpoint of rationalism.

[Kant] "Enlightenment and sensibility, both are necessary. The point is balance."
[Ikuo Nishida] "The question would be how to combine enlightenment and sensitivity."
