Answer questions you don't understand
A "When I look at question-based websites, I see many people answering questions appropriately even though they don't know the answers. Why do people want to answer questions they don't know the answers to?"
B "That's because many people prioritize gaining a sense of superiority by saying, 'I was able to answer a question that this person didn't understand,' over getting the right answer."
C (B also prioritizes superiority...)
