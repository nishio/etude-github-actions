Pragmatic Discussion
[/noratetsu/discussions are conducted with an awareness of whether the direction is pragmatic or not].
I guess an un-pragmatic argument would be something like "how many angels can sit on the end of a pin?"

Since my default value system is pragmatism, I would think that "all answers are equally correct because whatever the outcome of this discussion will not bring value to my life" and "participating in this discussion is not correct because it consumes time and produces no benefit".

Pragmatism in [/arpla/argumentation].

[Linux is utilitarian.]

There is a difference between an argument for utilitarianism and my argument, when I am utilitarian.
　The utilitarian argument is not based on "this is the way it should be" as in the Linux argument, but on "this would be useful".
　My argument, when I am pragmatic, is much different.
　　My utilitarianism means that my definition of what is "right" about things is that they are "beneficial to my life".
　　In this case, even if someone else claims "this is more convenient", it can be rejected with "but it's not convenient for me".
　　I can accept the information that "it would be more convenient for Mr. A" because it is neither positive nor negative for me.
　　The argument of "is it or not?", "A recognizes that it is" and "B recognizes that it is not", so both can be accepted.
　　　uncontested
　　　No need to argue because it ends with "I don't think so, but you think so, huh, I see.
　　　　Fighting where there is no profit in fighting is a negative for the amount of effort it takes to fight, so the act itself is not right for me.
