 Interesting. I like the novel method of expression. It would be interesting if I could write something like this.
 
 
 PS: The biography of this writer, given to me by id:voluntas, is also interesting. <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E6%A9%8B%E8%B2%B4%E6%98%8E'>Takaaki Mitsuhashi - Wikipedia</a>
 
 *1235242625*Housekeeping
 Note: I was told that it is strange that I have to empty the house and return the key on the 28th, but I haven't contacted the moving company yet, so my first priority task tomorrow is to find the contact information of the company that gave me a binding quote when I signed the contract for my new house and see if it's still okay with them.
