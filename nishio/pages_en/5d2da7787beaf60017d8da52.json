Where to access the instances created in [Reconciler
react-paper-bindings creates and returns a Raster instance of Paper.js in Reconciler's createInstance
	Where can I access the object returned here?
	https://github.com/react-paper/react-paper-bindings/blob/50c16e349b0ceb1bf06c08de0ef7981b02985bf6/src/PaperRenderer.js#L317
	I guess I need to look into React's Reconciler specs for this one.
		(The return value of <Raster> in JSX was of course not this instance itself, but an object created by React.)
	Passing references to external variables with ref

	Some commentaries interpret [ref] as a "reference to the DOM," but it is not a reference to the DOM, but to an object created in the Reconciler, which in the context of creating a web app is simply the DOM.
