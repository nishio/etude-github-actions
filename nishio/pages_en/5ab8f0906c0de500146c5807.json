Lecture slides are copyrighted
Everyone has their own way of making lecture slides, but I consider them to be "works of authorship.
Example of a different way of thinking: The speaker's own side is the main subject of the lecture, and the slides are just a starting point for the talk.
Some of these types of speakers are very good, so it must be the "style" of the speaker, not good or bad.

Example of considering a slide as a work of authorship
	Background is white for easy printing by the person who gets the slides
 No animation
 Some information is appended in small print that is not intended to be read at the time of the presentation (e.g., links to source papers)
  The equivalent of footnotes in a book

Why consider a slide as a work of authorship?
	It was the largest lecture I have ever experienced and the audience was, I believe, around 900 people.
 	Audio transmission in a lecture would only get the information to a mere 1,000 people in my time commitment.
 If you write a technical book, in most cases the first edition is 1,000 copies, and my book has a single digit more, but that's not a lot for the time commitment involved in creating it.
 On the other hand, the publication of lecture slides after the lecture can easily reach thousands of people.
 The distribution of slides after the lecture scales very efficiently in propagating knowledge.

Due to the idea of thinking of slides as works of authorship.
	Slides are the main part and the lecture is the secondary part.
 It's like "In commemoration of the release of the new slides, we will hold a commentary session by the author himself.
 For example, if a typhoon hits and blows out a lecture event, I just feel like, "Oh, it's too bad the commentary event was canceled.
