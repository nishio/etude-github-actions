 *1351764289*A word from my wife who read Web+DB Press vol.71
 Wife: "I didn't have much to read this time, so I just read Hamachi-chan's part! (click)"
 I said, "This is terrible."
 Wife: "I suspect that Hamachi-chan is a fictional character, an Internet idol."
 I said, "What, you're going to be a guest at the <a href='http://developer.cybozu.co.jp/tech/?p=612'>'Future of Engineering Summit for Students'</a> on November 10, and you're fictitious?
 My wife said, "It says FOR STUDENTS, can I go?"
 I said, "You're not a student..."

 My plan to "get my wife to write a book review" has suddenly failed... Well, it's true that "How to build a secure and robust website" may not be much of interest to my wife.
