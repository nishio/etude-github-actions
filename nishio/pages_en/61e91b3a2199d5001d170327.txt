(2.2.3.2-2) UCB1 algorithm
The UCB1 algorithm is a popular algorithm in thinking engine of computer go and shogi. This algorithm gives us a hint on how to cope with uncertain circumstances.

In the algorithm, we add terms that positively evaluate the uncertainty and then compare the choices. In other words, we include values ​​like [curiosity] in the evaluation. The curiosity makes us prefer to challenge the less experienced situations. *9

UCB stands for upper confidence bound. In daily life, we express uncertain values in the range form such as "perhaps 10 to 20". A range which includes an uncertain value with a certain probability is called a confidence interval. For example, in the case a value X is in the range of 10 to 20 with 95% probability, we express it that 95% confidence interval of X is 10 to 20. The upper confidence bound points to the larger boundary of this confidence interval. In this example, it is 20. Let's take a look at the diagram.

Fig: Accorging to the UCB1 algorithm, A is better


In ❶, by comparing Task A and B by their average, B is better. However, since this judgment is based on the average of what we have experienced so far, we may fall into the pessimistic misunderstanding. ❷ represents the confidence interval of the benefits of A and B. The confidence interval of A is wider than B. This is because the uncertainty of A is high. The benefit of A may be much larger than the average up to the present time, or it may be much smaller. By comparing on the upper bound of this confidence interval, A is better to choose.

By optimistic judgment like this, we reduce the possibility of falling into a pessimistic misunderstanding, and we balance the exploration and exploitation. Pushing back this idea back to the management context:  you should not judge by what you get on average, but what can you get in the best case.

	*9: This algorithm is known to be "[regret]" (difference of return from the case where the omniscient God chooses actions) is smaller than other methods, so we can say "optimism minimizes the regret."
