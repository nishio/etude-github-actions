Knowledge obsolescence and teaching poses
With age and position, more and more people assume the pose, "I have a lot of knowledge and I am a [teacher]," but when they assume that pose, they don't bring in any [new knowledge].
And knowledge is obsolete, so if new knowledge is not coming in, then more and more knowledge is being lost. [The status quo is regression].
To avoid [becoming old], we may have to keep the attitude of "[I don't know], [I want to know]" no matter how old we are.

[knowledge obsolescence].
