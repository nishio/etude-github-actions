You don't look so smart.
A "People who use the word X don't seem smart."
B "People who make the statement, 'People who use the word ~ don't seem to be smart' don't seem to be smart either."

[boomerang joke]

from [/villagepump/words that seem unwise].
If someone says they feel like they don't look smart, I don't think they need to conform to that at all.
　"Someone X said, 'People who use the word A don't seem smart'" is not equal to "People who use the word A are not smart."[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　 I mean, the real problem is that X may not be smart enough...
　 The statement "People who use the word ~ don't seem smart." doesn't seem smart! (Boomerang!)
