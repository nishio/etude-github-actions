Uniqueness of parsing connections
Given a function f and a function g whose domain is extended, this is not immediately [identical].
If the method of extension is not unique, f = g1 and f = g2 but g1 ! = g2.
It is only after showing [uniqueness] that we can equate a function f with a function g that is [parsimoniously connected] to it.
