	Clear boundaries for participation
 	Recognized as a legitimate member.
  [Legitimate Participation]

 Share information about the activities of the authorized internal organization with the rest of the organization
 	Understand what kind of activities they are engaged in.
 	[Participation in the vicinity]

When I wrote about [dual organization] before, I thought the outer boundaries were free to come and go.
	It was the image of an [open source community] user group.
 But the outer boundary being free to come and go is not a MUST requirement for a dual organization
	For example, if [Cybozu].
 	Within the group of employees, there is a subgroup called the general manager.
  Of course there is a selection process to get into the general manager's group, but there is also a selection process to get into the group of employees.
  	On 2018-04-23 wrote
  	Then they started [recruiting directors internally].
  Information that can be disclosed in discussions at general managers' meetings is made available to employees.
 According to the idea of legitimate peripheral participation, there should be explicit participation rituals (= legitimization of affiliation) at the outer boundaries as well
