	[Thomas Hobbs]

	Natural rights justify the right to use violence against others.
 	A state of war of all against all
 But I don't want to be violent myself.
 So we give up our right to violence against each other.
	We thought that a strong [public power] "Leviathan" was needed to stabilize this state of affairs.

	see [Civil Government Theory].
