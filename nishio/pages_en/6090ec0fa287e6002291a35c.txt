 It has been almost a year since my last post about my recent use of Scrapbox.
 
 Since then, this site has not been updated at all, while articles have been posted to Scrapbox one after another, exceeding 1,000 articles.
 
 I think it's time to properly clarify that "This is no longer a place that is updated, and the one that is updated now is <a href="https://scrapbox.io/nishio/%E3%81%93%E3%82%8C%E3%81%AF%E4%BD%95%EF%BC%9F">Scrapbox here</a >I think it's time to make it clear that this is a place that is no longer being updated.
 
 Hatena Diary has been the longest of the various self-expression tools I have used. Thank you for the long time.
