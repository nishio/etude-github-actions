VSCode Python Snippets
	In doing [atcoder], I've been designing [vscode] project snippets for frequently occurring code, but some [snippets] are useful for other general projects as well, so I wanted to use them.

	　I create a boiler plate full of things in main, but in other general projects, I want to use a part of it, like "Oh, I want to output debugging" or "I want to create test cases for doc test".
	　I'd rather just cut out the generic ones rather than try to do the same code base.
　　　I made it a separate project.

　　I know atcoder has a "must be in one file" restriction for submission, but for general projects, there isn't one, so it might be better to put them in a pip.

	Selections can also be multiplied by regular expression replacements.
