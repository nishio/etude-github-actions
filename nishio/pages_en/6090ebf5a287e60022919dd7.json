 *1201657909* Norovirus
 Oh, I overheard that there was a cold going around, or a cold that was going around in your stomach, but there is a norovirus going around.

 Norro is said to survive for more than 10 days if the temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius, and it is likely to be transmitted if you eat something with your hands that have touched a public object (such as a handrail or a strap).

 Well, let's just wash our hands and gargle properly.

 By the way, "Some land is easy to walk on and some land is difficult to walk on. If the starting point and the ending point are defined, the path is chosen so that the time is the shortest. That is the path that light chooses. It makes me wonder, "How does a photon know what lies ahead of it?" I wonder.
 
 *1201665633*Mercurialを入れる
 Tamarin's source code was managed by Mercurial.
 Older information says it's CVS.
 
 *1201668009* hmm?
 Is it popular to create closures in PHP?

 No, you have enough!
 
 I tried it too.

 *1201679063*[Emacs]背景色を変更
 If you are editing the source code of two unrelated projects (or the same if you are writing one with reference to the other), you are likely to mistake which one you are currently opening and do the wrong operation. I looked into changing the background color to avoid that.
 
 (The background color is in frames, so if you want to use one Django project X as a reference for editing another project Y, for example, you can use C-x52 to add more frames. You can use one frame for reference and the other for editing.
 
 If you have a better way, please let us know.
 
 *1201688319*[AS3]Continued: stack overflow even though it's just a loop
 http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20080129/1201600506
 >>
 I'll take a guess and write it down, but I think the process of popping diff * diff values off the stack during code generation is missing (probably a bug).
 And if you enclose it in try-catch, the correct code is generated, and so on.
 <<
 
 So I put it through disassembler.

 Oh, no. It's popping properly.... As far as I can see, there shouldn't be any problem....
 
 Incidentally, getscopeobject and getslot were used instead of getlocal because a scope is created when enclosed in a try.

 By the way, I took the kun-yomi and kanji meanings from Wiktionary. It's very convenient. I don't have to flip through a thick kanji dictionary.
 
 *1201708924*加湿
 I sleep wearing a mask because I don't think it is reasonable to humidify a room while being careful of condensation, even though the only mucous membranes that need humidity are those of the nose and throat.

 <body>I think there is a color scheme that is easy on the eyes, so I don't think it's a good idea to change the background color in various ways. <BR><BR>I remember reading an O'Reilly book once upon a time that said blackish brown for text and whitish blue to green for the background<BR>(hazy memory). <BR><BR>While I'm at it, it would be interesting to calculate a hash value from the full path string of the file and use it to determine the background color. <BR><BR>On a completely different note, wouldn't it be possible to avoid confusion by using a virtual screen? <br>Some virtual screen software allows you to specify a desktop wallpaper for each screen. </body>

 <body>The direction of a light source is only stochastically determined, but as soon as an observer observes the light emitted by the source, the direction of the light source converges in the direction of the observer back in the past. The Copenhagen interpretation is that the future determines the past. <br>...and I will try to show my half-baked knowledge of the world of quantum mechanics. </body>

 <body>Is it because differential equations with local meaning are derived from variational principles with global implications, and yet they describe our observable world? It seems strange. </body>

 <username>わたなべ</username>
 <body>I recognize that the variational principle is only a locally valid principle, and to give it a global meaning (exactly as Nishio-san thought) is metaphysical and really bad. </body>
