 Convert `Vector3[]` to string using [JSONUtility] and save it in [PlayerPrefs].

[SAVE]
 I don't want to deal with [Unity - Scripting API: File https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Windows.File.html] in raw
 IL2CPP, using LitJson is old since Unity can handle JSON as standard
  https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/JsonUtility.html
 [PlayerPrefs] looks good.

	How do you do file read/write?
 Should I read and write in JSON?
 Where are files saved when read/write on Oculus Go?

This is a more chewed up version of this that I had previously written
>I want to hit the Scrapbox API to get Lines, make them into Draggable objects and place them in the scene.
> I want to save the edited result on Unity on the net and restore it later.
