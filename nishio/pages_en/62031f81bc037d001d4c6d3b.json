It's obvious which is right.
It is a logical leap to claim that "it is obvious that Y is correct" by showing evidence that X is not correct.
It implicitly assumes that "either X or Y is true." This assumption can be false. That is, both can be incorrect.

For example, suppose X and Y are fighting, and Y argues, "X's statement is defamatory, so it is clear that Y is right. By the same logic, X could argue, "Y's statement is defamatory, so it is obvious that X is right. This means that since it is possible for both to be libelous, the latter part, "It is obvious that ~ is correct," is logically correct.

'Showing them they're not right doesn't make you right.
