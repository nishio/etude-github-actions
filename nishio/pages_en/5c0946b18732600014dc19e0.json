Doppelganger World
I enjoyed the question, "Would you be happy if your society consisted only of people like your doppelganger?"

In that case I would abolish voice communication, implant electronic communication chips in everyone's brain, and be very happy to create a world where "what I say and what I think are different" or "what I want to say cannot be conveyed because I cannot put it into words well" etc. never happen.

Response 1: It would be more interesting if it were shaky.
	If you have a system without fluctuations, it is easy to add fluctuations to it when you feel like it. It is difficult to eliminate fluctuation in a system with fluctuation.
 For example, it is easy to create a system that "randomly disables some words" or "randomly replaces words in the communication channel" and see how it interacts, and I would be amused and on board if the other I were to offer to interact with it.

Response 2: I talk about the same thing quite a few times, but each time the situation is different, so I think there is merit in talking about the same thing.
	I am not denying that we talk about the same thing.
 We subjectively perceive that we have spoken about the "same thing" in different situations, but in reality we are thinking about slightly different things at different times because the situations are different. We think "the same thing," when in fact it is "similar."
 Since thoughts are not recorded, they cannot be compared later and are vaguely perceived as "the same thing".
 If they had recorded it, they would be able to abstract a step further by comparing slightly different thought processes depending on the situation.
