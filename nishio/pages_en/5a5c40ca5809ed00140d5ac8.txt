Series and parallel
When connecting cables in [series], it is strongly required not to make a mistake because if even one of the cables is broken, it is a total loss.
In the case of [parallel] connections, it is enough if even one is working, so the emphasis is on having many, even if they are of low quality.
There is a difference in what is required between the [mathematical] way of [tightly] packed [thinking] and the [brainstorming] way of [quantity over quality]. #even if
