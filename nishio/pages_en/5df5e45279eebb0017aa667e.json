100vh, it sticks out vertically.
	I had set the canvas size to `100vh - var(--toolbar-height)`, but when viewed on an iPhone, it was too long vertically, causing the toolbar to be hidden by scrolling.
	100vh seems to be the length including the height of the address bar

	Address bar is hidden when scrolling
	If the app doesn't scroll, the bottom of the page gets cut off when it's set to 100vh.
	The solution is to add `height: 100%` to all of them. and adding `height: 100%` to all of them solves the problem.
	I also added `user-scalable=no`, but I'm not sure if this is required.
