embedded vector
Notation sway absorption:
	A vector with embedded words is called a [word vector].
	Vector with embedded characters [character vector].

What is [embedded] in the first place?
	To [map] a discrete set of [symbols], such as [words] or [letters], into a [vector space] with addition and scalar multiplication.
 Mathematically.
 	>In mathematics, embedding (うめこみ, embedding, imbedding) is a monjection such that the structure between mathematical structures is preserved.
		[Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9F%8B%E3%82%81%E8%BE%BC%E3%81%BF_(%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6)]
		But in this case, the original set is just a discrete set, so there's no particular structure to preserve.
 Therefore, the expression "embedding vector" may not be very appropriate, but it is quite common to call the layer in charge of this processing "embedding layer" in the field related to [natural language processing] using [neural networks], so it cannot be helped.
