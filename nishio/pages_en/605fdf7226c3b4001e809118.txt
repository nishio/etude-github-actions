People up to/from
In relation to [the debriefing is a start, not a goal], I note another person's expression that is interesting.

The original expression is that there are "people to [unexplored]" and "people from [unexplored]," but it is not specific to any particular concrete project, so it will be abstracted below.

This is a type of project that has a [results debriefing session] at the end of a certain period of training, and there are "people up to the results debriefing session" and "people from the results debriefing session.

ã€€(After writing all this, I thought "people up to and including adoption" and "people from adoption" were also possible.
 (Is this the same as "people to pass" and "people from pass" in college? Related: [start, not goal].


[Up to]/[From].
