Power of Attribution
What is going on in your brain when you look at a problem and attribute it to a known data structure?

 Abstraction?"
 　I feel uncomfortable.
 　Problems that can be solved by abstracting the problem and applying it to a known data structure are called "just paste," and they're considered low-quality problems.
 　　Those that only apply to known solutions are also called "typical".
 　　I feel like the process of solving "quality problems" requires you to do something else, which I tentatively call "the power of attribution."
 　　I'm not sure what this "power to return" is and what it is trained by.
	Applied?"
	　You're half right.
	　Maybe it's abstraction that brings a problem closer to a known solution or data structure, and application that brings a known solution or data structure closer to the problem.
