	[A metaphor for thinking] is [a hook for catching fish below the surface of the water].
　　Talk about metaphors for thinking, not for communicating
　　Metaphors for thinking are clues, hooks, and hooks for pulling out what has not yet been verbalized
　　Therefore, its first role is to maintain a connection to "what has not yet been verbalized".
　　By using that connection to hook a second and third hook, we can eventually pull out "what has not yet been verbalized".
　　This "connection" is severed by the [reverse Jenga] collapse.
