Re: date-based vs. event-based
from [/unnamedcamp/date-based and event-based].

[/unnamedcamp/nora.icon]As an example of my personal use, I have created a project in Scrapbox for my diary at this time, and I keep creating pages called "yyyymmdd_event". If you ask me whether it is date-based or event-based, it is event-based, but I am very conscious of the date.
	Create a project for your diary in [/noratetsu/Scrapbox].
		Since almost all pages are of the form "yyyymmdd_event", we do not have a situation where there are pages related to a date in a group of pages that have nothing to do with dates.
		I didn't mention the most important thing, but usually we make multiple pages a day.
		ã€€This "event" is not representative of the day or anything like that, but rather "an event unit page, with a date.
	[/unnamedcamp/rashita.icon]I have the impression that this one is date-based, [event-based].
		Then, [what is date-based], the definition stands (needs to be reviewed).
		yyyymmdd_event" is an object that contains date information as meta information.
			What is the difference between this approach and date-based management?
			The "date_event" method requires that the "event" be verbalized at the time of titling[/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon].
			 If you're trying to keep a record in Scrapbox when you "haven't yet verbalized the events," it's going to be date-based.
			 For example, when you think "Today is an unscheduled holiday and the weather is nice, so let's go for a walk," you can make it "date_walk," or you can make it a "date" page with the event unspecified. It could be "Date_X Considerations" after the fact, after I gloss over what I saw and felt in the course of my walk, or it could be "Date_f" after I find some interesting facility f
			 Because [unnamed experiencing has only date information] to summarize in one line?
