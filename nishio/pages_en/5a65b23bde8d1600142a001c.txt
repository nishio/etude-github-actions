Risk Aversion and Innovator Theory
	there appears to be a connection
 I can experiment #Experimentation required
	What about the linear case?
 What about S-curves?

	Think about the decision to buy or not to buy a certain product.
 If the utility x obtained by buying a product is known, you don't have to worry about it, but in reality, it is unknown.
 Let's express uncertainty and say N(x, e)
 In this case, too, if the relationship between the amount of profit loss and utility is linear, then buying at x is correct.
 But as [prospect theory] points out, there is a large coefficient on the loss side E(x) = x if x > 0 else k * x
 In a situation where the price of the same product is decreasing or the utility x of the product is increasing with the same price, the larger the k, the more delayed the timing of the purchase #Experiment needed
 	The [innovator theory] is reproduced.
 The estimate of x is raised by "others are buying" [principle of social proof].
  Is this a factor that causes bubbles to occur #Experiment required
 Utility of "buying what others have not yet bought

	The negative utility of losing x amount of money depends on the amount of money you have.
  I hesitated to buy a $3,000 technical book when I was in high school, but I am less hesitant now that I am working and have a comfortable income.
