No bad questions.
 The [question] is also beneficial to the respondent
 [Masahiro Maeno, https://twitter.com/irobutsu/status/923685998575304709]
  If the respondent is inclined to "ask [a good question]," the question itself will not come up.

  If the question is, "Didn't I just explain that to you?" then that shows that that part was not communicated.
  If a basic question is asked that you left out because you thought it was self-evident, you will find that there is a gap in your assumptions.
