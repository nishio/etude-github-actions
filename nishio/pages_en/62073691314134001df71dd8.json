Prosperity prepares you for adversity.

It is both wise and easy to gather winter's reserves in the summer. In times of prosperity, favors are cheap and friends are plentiful. Therefore it is better to store them up for the unlucky day. Store up friendly and beneficent persons. The day may come when their price will rise. The low-brow has no friends; he will not recognize them in times of good fortune, nor will he be recognized by them in times of misfortune.
