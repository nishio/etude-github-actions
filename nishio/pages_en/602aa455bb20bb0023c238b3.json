　At first I didn't realize the top half was through and thought there were three 30 degree slopes.
　　I didn't know how to fix it, so I wrote on Twitter and they told me.

		The structure of the part that is visible on the outside seems to be correct; it may take some trial and error to determine where to grow the T-shape from.

		In fact, it is possible that the three eyeballs are connected to each other and not to the others, and that they are stopped by pressing down from above...
		Hmmm, narrow...

		I don't have enough material to try it, but this would just barely fit in a 2×3 gap.

	>I had only bought two sets last year, so I had to do some trial and error with what parts I could find. It's more severe than I thought. ......

	I see, as for the sides, you combine a 1×1 panel that goes through with a block that has a concave center of studs so that the pipe can go all the way in.

 Is this the black bar growing sideways from the center bar? I don't have one and will buy one.

	>I'm not sure if I'm getting the right response because I feel like I've twisted it up quite a bit. ......
 > That's what the black bars are for. I haven't tried it because I don't have it on hand, but I have a feeling you could do something similar with two arm-shaped clip bars!

	Hmmm, I might not be able to reach it as it is.

	I added another one and it connected at least once...

	>Sorry!
 > I know it sounds like I'm in the wrong place, but I just bought a few more sets today and I've been playing around with them, and I think I've got a good set up, so I'll share it with you!
 > I personally want to make it right because it's not a weirdly elaborate assembly and it's reasonably strong lol.
