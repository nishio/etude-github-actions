 **1235426800* Actual examples of failures caused by timezone not always being JST, even for Japanese web services.
 Oh, this could be used as an example for something. I'll make a note of it.
 >>
 Based on this, the article reported that "about six hours before the incident, there was a post suggesting the crime was committed.
 
 　However, when the article was published, the Internet pointed out a number of oddities.
 
 　Wikipedia uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and the edit history is also displayed in UTC. It is possible to view the site in Japan Standard Time (JST), but this requires the reader to obtain a Wikipedia user account, log in, and set the time difference from UTC (+9 hours from JST).
 
 　Setting the display to Japan time and looking at the history page pointed out by the Mainichi Shimbun article, one can see that the "x" posts in question were made "between 9:27 p.m. and 9:32 p.m. on the 18th," or three hours after the Nakano crime was committed.

 *1235428666*Household Diary
 I don't feel well with my nose.
 
 
 Yesterday, I tried twice to carry my luggage on the back of my bike and failed twice. I'm not quite sure what to aim for anymore.
 
 
 <a href='http://www.kondo-sanko.jp/popup/index.php?ID=35210&PHPSESSID=be822e54c2226a280e594dac06e5a4f3'> Rear Car | Utility Equipment_Rear Car | Rental Products, I don't know how to bring the rear car and park it on the first floor bicycle parking lot.
 
 
 
 Extended cargo bed.

 It's perfect. I think I can go for it.

 I called the movers.
 >>
 C: That will be 31,500 yen.
 Me: What? Your e-mail said 12650 yen!
 HA: That's because, you know, if you have additional luggage or something...
 Me: No, no, it says in the email that an additional 10 boxes of cardboard boxes or so would cost an extra 1,000 yen.
 HA: That is not a confirmed rate! If you had contacted me yesterday, I could have offered you 20,000 yen.
 <<
 
 >>
 Co: Not until March!
 <<
 
 Mwu. In the end, I got my final answer from Heart Moving Center. So it ended up costing about 30,000 yen everywhere. I guess moving costs a lot of cash.
 
 
 'Here's your cardboard delivery, do you want me to stand it up on your doorstep when you're not home?' No, it's an auto-lock.... Because of the auto-lock, I have to be present for electricity and gas, which is inconvenient.
 
 
 I've changed my schedule writing to howm style, but howm doesn't uniq the schedule so I get a lot of the same schedule...
 
 
 I feel like I've lost the advantage of moving and transporting things by myself, so I guess I'll just start packing things into cardboard boxes tomorrow, and only carry the stuff that bores me well. And PCs and other breakables.
 
 
 I'm feeling pretty sorry for myself, I guess, but I searched for "flexible bookshelf" or something like that to buy a bookshelf and found http://www.interiinu.net/?pid=6295092 and http://fukufuku.shop-pro.jp/?pid= 7859156 and found something like that and thought "I like this" and saw that the price wasn't much different and the name of the product was "The ultimate stick-on bookshelf! Protrusive!" I found it and thought, "I like it," and saw that the price wasn't much different, and then checked the product name: "The Ultimate Bookcase! I saw that the price was not much different from the original. I search for "Rakuten Ultimate Bookcase! I didn't want to add more vendors with my credit card number if the price wasn't much different, and I could get a little discount with Rakuten points, and it was easy to search. So the cheapest one on Rakuten is <a href="http://pt.afl.rakuten.co.jp/c/02f9ff29.918fb7b7/?url=http%3a%2f%2fitem.rakuten.co.jp%2fesco%2fthon-1%2f" target="_blank">here</a>, so I bought it here. There was another place with the same price, but I rejected it because it said that I had to buy it by bank transfer, even though it said that credit cards were OK.
 
 
 Rice left at room temperature becomes like plastic and is inedible, but rice left frozen for six months is edible only if it is rubbery and crunchy.
 
 
 I got a huge headache and chills...
 
 
 Is changing the address on the residence certificate and setting up mail forwarding something to be done before moving? If I think about it calmly, if I don't do so, there will be downtime. It's too obvious. I'll do it tomorrow.
 
 
 I realized from my experience yesterday and today that it is impossible to carry Luminous on a bicycle. I'm sure it would be a big accident at the intersection, scattering the parts. I think I should just use curing tape to cover the location of large items in the new house.
 
 
 The extended cargo bed mentioned above is nice. However, it is a pain to pack and fasten the luggage in the carrying case. I just checked and the two baskets I use for laundry just fit perfectly, so it would be useful to be able to easily fasten them.
 Yesterday, I was cheated because the rubber strap I bought at a 100 yen store could not be fixed at all! But if the cargo bed is solid, the rubber strap is enough to secure it, and on the other hand, a 10-meter rope would be a lot of work. It would be better if I buy one or two more rubber straps so that it can be fixed both vertically and horizontally.

 Wow, it even contains ununoctium! I can only imagine that ununoctium is "heavy"...but when I anthropomorphize it, I am often challenged laterally in the U.S.A. or elsewhere.
