Structure of the iPad presentation
Composition in "[Engineers' intellectual production techniques and physical education-type classes]"
	Connecting AppleTV to a projector via HDMI
 iPadからAirPlayで接続
  Wireless connectivity will allow you to roam the venue as you please.
 	Do I have to be in the same wifi? I thought so, but there is no need to be in the same wifi, it seems to be shared via Bluetooth.
  I prepared an adapter in case it doesn't work well and I need to use a direct cable connection.
	Keynote for iPadでプレゼン
 	I thought about using Keynote or PDF files in Dropbox, but I couldn't figure out how to flip through them slide by slide.
  	It's turned into a scroll.
   I seem to remember it being done before, but am I imagining things?
  I thought what AirPlay could do was "mirroring the iPad screen", but you can use the presenter tool normally.
	Dropboxで書籍内検索
 	I have a PDF of "The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production" on my Dropbox.
  I downloaded it locally and opened it.
