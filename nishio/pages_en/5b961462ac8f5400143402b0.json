cursive Japanese syllabary used primarily for native Japanese words (esp. function words, inflections, etc.)
[Hiragana] is obviously optimized for vertical writing so that the final stroke is toward the upper left of the character below. But in reality, it is often used in horizontal writing today, so shouldn't it be [redesigned] so that the final stroke is toward the upper left corner of the left character?

Related [Hayakana].
