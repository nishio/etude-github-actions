No one is great.
>I often tell students,
> There is no such thing as a "great person. There are just "people at times" in their lives when they are a little more needed and responsible than others.
> It is not important to be great, but what you do at the moment is important, and if you have a [false sense of dignity] that you have to be great all the time, it will be hard to live.
