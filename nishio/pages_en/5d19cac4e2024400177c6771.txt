Ensure that the selection state is maintained after multiple lasso moves
[Multiple moves at once by selecting lasso] could be implemented.
	By the way, after selecting more than one in the lasso selection and moving on,
		The position of the selected object is updated and redrawn,
		Currently, the highlight of the selection target is not in the UNDO/REDO target state, so it looks like it was deselected.
	If it looks like it's deselected but it's not, you should be able to move it by dragging lasso again.
		If you do that, you will die. The reason is simple: the PaperItem that the selection is pointing to has been re-created by the above redraw.
	This area will be easily resolved once the PaperItem reuse fix is in place, but it's on hold for now.
		If you select it and move it, the selection will be canceled, according to the specifications.
