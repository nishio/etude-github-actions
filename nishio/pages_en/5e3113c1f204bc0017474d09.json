>Cybozu's approach to budgets is a bit unique. The person in charge of each product adds up the numbers he or she estimates, saying, "This is the amount of sales we will have next year," and then adds them together. There is no such thing as being told by President Aono "how much we should do," or having management members discuss "how much we should do," and then assigning the results to each product.
