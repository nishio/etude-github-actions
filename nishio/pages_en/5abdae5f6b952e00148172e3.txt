Fighting the Past
 He said to me, "Mr. Nishio, don't you often fight with your past self?"
 I've already done what I was going to do in the past.
 You forgot what you did.
 As we get older, our protein-made [memories] fade.
 If you don't externalize it, you'll certainly forget it.
 So we need to externalize it at a time when we remember it by some stimulus.
 Conversely, because we immediately externalized the idea when we came up with it in the past, when we come up with the same idea now, we realize that we were thinking the same thing in the past!
 	If I'd thought about doing it someday, I'd have forgotten about it and come up with it again as a new idea.
  A sterile cycle that accumulates nothing.
 I'm in a better position than my future self, and I have to do it now.
