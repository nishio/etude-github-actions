시간이 빠르게 흘러서 벌써 수능　일이 다가났습니다
Time is flying by and we are already approaching the proficiency test.

그동안 너무 고생 많으셨을텐데 열심이 노력했던 것들이 다 뜻대로 잘 풀리셨으면 좋겠어요! 
I know it's been a lot of hard work, but it's something you've worked very hard for, and I hope you'll be able to pull it off as well as you'd like!

 그동안 너무 고생 많으셨을텐데 열샘이 노력했던 것들이 다 뜻대로 잘 풀리셨으연 좋겠어요! 
 I like the way you have been working so hard to make it all work out!
 　The phrase "텐으셨을데" translated as "you must have had a lot of hardships" means "you must have had a lot of hardships." ref https://yaseteru.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/07/01/112952
 　The part that is prurichotoyon contains 셨 as well.
 　　으연 -> 으면 for "in the case of ~"

긴장하지 말고 그동안 쌓아온 것들 잴이실수 있게, 좋은결과 있기를 예지가 열심이 응원하고 바랄게요!
I hope Yezi will cheer enthusiastically, without nervousness and with what we have accumulated so far so that the classification is wrong, there are good results!
I hope that Yeji will support you hard and hope that there will be good results so that you can measure the things you have accumulated so far without being nervous!

 간장하거 말고 그돔안 쌓아온 것들 잘핫실수 있게, 좋은결과 있기를 예지가 열샘이 음원하고 바랄게요!
 	I hope that YOLSEM will be the source of the prediction that there will be a good result in the Jalhat mistake that Domuan has cultivated, without soy sauce!
  Soy sauce: 간장→긴장 for "tension", so this one?
  In 잴이실수 "measurement is wrong"
  Eager in 열심
  Domuan 돔안→동안 中

모든 수험생 여러분들 화이팅
Fighting for all candidates!
