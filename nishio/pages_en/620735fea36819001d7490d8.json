Let us each maintain our dignity.

Let each of us maintain our dignity.

Let one's conduct be worthy of a prince, if not of a king, then of a prince in degree, and let one's actions be prince-like to the extent that they are justified. Be noble in action, noble in thought, and in all things, if not in power, at least in merit, like a king. True kingship is in spotless purity, and there is no need to envy the great men whose example is to be emulated. Especially those close to the throne should aspire to true superiority and prefer to share its true qualities rather than participate in the mere rituals of kingship, but share its true majesty without letting its imperfections affect them.
