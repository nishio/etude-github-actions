 I started by wondering how the digital pins of the Arduino and Raspberry Pi read and write, and then I decided to make a logic circuit with a transistor that I had on hand, and I decided to start with the simplest NOT. I decided to start with NOT, which is the simplest one, and ended up spending the whole weekend on NOT alone.
 
 What I was stumped by was that I checked the datasheet to see which leg was the gate, but I mistakenly thought the diagram was a "top view" when it was a "bottom view," so the transistors were facing the other way.

 â†‘upAt the time of this tweet, I'm still assuming it's a top view.
