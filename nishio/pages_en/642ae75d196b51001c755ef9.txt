What would you do if you had a thousand people in your life?
Question by [Daiki Teramoto] at [Mittoku Junior OpenAI / ChatGPT Roundtable].

I think this is [an important question].

I don't know if that's a good answer, but I'll jot down what comes to mind.
　[The Art of Worldly Wisdom.
　　There are "understandable", "unintelligible", "interesting", and "uninteresting" for fragmentary sentences.
　　Sometimes associating and connecting one thing to another in response to a sentence.
　　　For example, [the wise man is immortal] was connected with Lao Tzu.
　　　It's interesting what these things occur.
　　Past Hatena Diaries that have been imported and are searchable but not linked, Twitter and Facebook that have not even been imported, and PDFs of lectures that have been partially imported but the method is questionable.
　　 I would like to see these become "[a] better form of knowledge representation."
　　 That "better form of knowledge representation" is not yet known.
　　 Vector search.
	　　 [Nodal point of thought 2023-04-04].
　　　　If you read them and say, "Answer the questions," you will be told, "There is no information. If you read them and say, "Summarize," you will be told, "There is a lot of information.
　　　　I want you to "think." What is thinking?
　　　　When I reinforce my thoughts in Kozaneba, I first chop them into smaller units.
　　　　　Scrapbox is long-term memory, vector search results are "associations."
　　　　　Chop it up into small pieces and place them in space.
　　　　　　What is spatial arrangement?
　　　　　　Work close together with close associative distance
　　　　　　[Associative connection]
　　　　　Whether it is due to human limitations to make it two-dimensional or whether it is inherently important is a mystery.
