Not by name recognition.
 The theory that "[gaining] name recognition is important."
 I feel uncomfortable about this.
  A sense that the goal is not to gain recognition.
  [Needs Seas Matching] is the source of value.
  It is important to connect with key people who can do this.
   This is just hard to understand because it is unobservable.
 Behaviors that increase visibility are also positively correlated with connections to key people.
  So there is still a positive correlation to value.
 	Even if there is [correlation], whether there is [causation] is subtle.
