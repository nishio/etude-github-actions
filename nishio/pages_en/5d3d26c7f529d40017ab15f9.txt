Unexplored Quotes
At the unexplored [boost meetings], good comments are made by various people, but because of the NDA, they are buried as they are, which is a waste. Some of the messages that PMs and OB/OGs throw out to the current creators are useful for the creators in the next year and beyond.

I was thinking that it would be better to send out these kinds of comments more and more, instead of closing them to the unexplored, and wrote in the Facebook group of the 2019 Boost Conference that it would be good to have a Twitter account like a "quotes bot for unexplored people". At the reception afterwards, I had a lively discussion with [/mitou-meikan/Masataka Goto], and he gave me an idea that it would be easy to create a "quotes thread" on the Facebook group and approve quotes by "liking" them.

In the future, it might be a good idea to put them in the Mitou Meikan ([/mitou-meikan]), but I'm not sure how it should be done, so I'll put them on my personal page for now.
	Thoughts on making the 2019 edition
		I thought, "This is the first time, so maybe it's not too much," but when I tried to write it, it was more than I thought it would be, so one page per event seemed like a good idea.
		Often the speaker himself writes something relevant to the public forum.
			It's no surprise when you think about it
			I would like to actively link such things.
				We should be able to properly convey the concepts that the speaker wanted to convey.
				It is not a favorable state of affairs when only short sentences taken out of context are circulated with a different meaning than the person intended.

	The Future is Already Here" Hiromi Okuda
		Public text by the person:.
 		>"I am from the future!" Hiromi Okuda's lecture begins with these words. Of course, I did not come in a time machine from the year 2050 or something. The future exists "speckled" in the real world, and some visionary leaders can already see "the future they want to be. Not only can they see it, they are already living it.
   >Hiromi Okuda is a Visionary Partner who discovers and accompanies "people of the future" who are already living in the present. It may be difficult to be understood in today's world filled with the values and behaviors of the past. Hiromi Okuda accompanies such visionary leaders, and together they destroy unnecessary modes of behavior and create new values."

	"Commercialization requires 'futsu-no labor'" Takao Ito
		[nishio.icon]↑This is a little lacking in information, and I have a feeling that it will not make sense a year from now, but if I write it down, I can improve it later, so I'll just write it down for now.

	The first time in JST, chat was introduced in the area meeting, referring to the culture of "unexplored"" Masataka Goto
		[nishio.icon] It doesn't sound like a "quote" but I cut it out thinking it was "Ideas worth spreading".
		Public information:.
			>The biannual "camp-style" area conference is a major event. When we listened to and discussed 60 presentations by first and second year students over two days, it felt like we were all pushing the limits of our intellect.
			>It is wonderful and a great opportunity for top-class young researchers in different fields to make horizontal connections with each other.
			>The "root" of informatics and the enthusiasm to become a top-notch researcher are common. [* We are devising ways to deepen interactions to serve as a foundation for future collaboration. In addition to the Q&A session after the presentations, we introduced a text chat tool as the first attempt by JST to allow participants to comment casually even during the presentations. Presenters are now able to receive more opinions and ideas, and all participants can engage in lively discussions].
			>(omitted)
			>As "Information and the Future" was the first research area for ACT-I, it was impossible to follow precedents in the first place, so it was both fun to design freely from scratch and difficult to manage. In order to make it a better area, at the end of each area meeting [* we have a 5-minute opinion-gathering period each time using text chat]. Hundreds of comments are received, and we try to maintain the good points and improve the bad points to make the operation more meaningful for ACT-I researchers.

		This "introducing a text chat tool so that participants can easily comment during the presentation" is a method that has been used for more than 10 years by WISS and others, and is not limited to unexplored. see: [parallel chat for presentations].

	I want to try it! →Good to be honest!" Yoshinori Takezako

	The Opposite of Essence is Formality Kunihiro Tanaka
		Public Tweet by the person in question
			>There are people and organizations that make judgments based on formalities in writing, while the text of laws, regulations, and rules have the essential background of "why," "for what," "for whom," and "with what expectation.
   > The opposite of essence is form. If you are punished or arrested for formality, you are stuck with it.
   > By the way, Article 1 of the law states the essence of the law.
