Store logs in an easily accessible form.
	I'm copying and shaping it by hand right now.
		When I run it locally, I keep it in a readable form on hand, but now that it's running on the server.
	 Store and view on server
	 API to return in a form that is easy to import into regroup
	Make sure to log to env.

Can now be displayed in /log/<name> on heroku
