 *1244682283* Security & Programming Camp Registration is now open!
 See more at: http://www.jipdec.or.jp/camp/
 This is an overnight event from 2009-08-12 to 2009-08-16. All participants must be students under the age of 22, and all fees, including accommodation and transportation to and from the venue, are free of charge.
 
 The camp is divided into a "Security Course" and a "Programming Course," and the Programming Course is further divided into three groups: "Let's Make an OS," "Programming Language Group," and "Linux Kernel Group. I will be teaching the programming language group with <a href="http://www.atdot.net/~ko1/diary/200906.html">Mr. Sasada</a>.
 
 >>
 The language group will focus on the programming language Ruby and its language processing system, with the following three main points
 -1. how the programming language is realized
 -2. how a Ruby processor, an example of large-scale software, is built
 -3. how to improve the performance of practical software
 The objective is to learn about

 I think it takes a lot of courage to sign up for this kind of thing. Especially for middle and high school students, there are many cases where they think that this kind of event is something that takes place in a world that has nothing to do with them (when in fact, they may be able to reach it if they just reach out!) This seems to be the case in many cases. If you can contact a student who might be interested in these events, please give him a push. That one word might trigger an interesting future, you know?

 *1244713688*[Inkscape]Today's drawing
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090606/1244286175'>Last time</a>, I was saying "This isn't enough" and adding things and thinking "I don't like the clutter", but now it suddenly I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.

 It's a draft, so the lines are drawn properly, but it's quite nice if you use the ratio of the sides to be 1 : sqrt(2) and make it recursive.

 <a href='http://www.nishiohirokazu.org/what_i_did/virtual_star/'>Virtual Star</a>, a draft of which was exhibited at Make: Tokyo Meeting 03, was selected for the <a href='http://www.nishiohirokazu.org/what_i_did/virtual_star/'>TAGBOAT SUMMER AWARD 2009</a> held at @GALLERY TAGBOAT! It was selected for the <a href='http://www.tagboat.com/ngs/award/summer/2009/about.html'>TAGBOAT SUMMER AWARD 2009</a> held at @GALLERY TAGBOAT!
 
 
 I had exhibited "A3 printout at a convenience store" at Make: Tokyo Meeting 03, and after seeing the reaction, I thought, "I have to do this! So I hurriedly started to create a version of the work for award submission and managed to complete it and submit it two days before the deadline. I was losing confidence when I found out that the previous year's competition was four times higher than the first round of 61 entries, with a total of 280 entries.
 
 The photo below is the one I submitted, but it was taken with my cell phone because I didn't have my camera ready in time, so the white balance is not good and it looks very dark.

 The actual color is close to the one below, but this one has been hurt a lot by the process of reducing the manuscript data to 1/8th of its original size. I need more skill to make the work look better. lol;.

 We are pleased to announce that we have been selected for a prize and will be having a group exhibition at the venue below next weekend. You can see the actual works if you come here. It will be rather interesting to see the works of 60 selected artists including myself all in one place.

 Now, since I suspect that many readers of this blog are information technology people, let me explain the background of this piece in that context.
 <strong>I hate unrepeatable bugs</strong>. <strong>It's not nice when 100 / 10 is "roughly 10, sometimes 11". <strong>We don't like it when things that should match don't match exactly</strong>, and we don't want y + x to be 9.9609375 when x + y is 10. <strong>We don't want people to repeat themselves</strong>. principle, right? Computers are better at repetitive tasks, so we want to leave it to them and concentrate on higher-level instructions on what to repeat.
 
 
 Programmers have their own "aesthetics" and create "beautiful" code according to their own aesthetics. However, this "beauty" is not well understood by non-programmers. That's right. We express ourselves in code, a medium that only we can understand. If you were a creature that could see ultraviolet light, and you drew a beautiful picture using ultraviolet light, most of mankind would not understand it. If you think it is beautiful, you should not only say, "This is beautiful," but also bring it into the visible light range that we can see, even if it means sacrificing a little expression. I think the reverse is also true. I think that the rigor, symmetry, and regularity that I love and find "beautiful" should be expressed in the form of, for example, a two-dimensional physical object that can be easily understood by non-programmers.
 
 
 Of course, at this point in time, I do not believe that my work is yet complete. But if the "design guidelines" I wrote above caught your attention and made you want me to create more with these design guidelines, I would be very grateful if you could <a href='http://www.tagboat.com/ngs/award/summer/2009/initial_screening. html'>poll page</a>, search for Virtual Star and press the vote button. It will be very encouraging.

 Best regards.

 PS: Of course, if you go to the voting page and find a better work there, you can vote for it. Good things deserve to be appreciated. Please choose which one to vote for according to "your aesthetics".

 PS: Yes, the explanation of the background is only the explanation of the background, but the explanation of the important works is missing (^^;)
 The name "Virtual Star" comes from the fact that although stars are visible to the human eye, they are actually represented only by circles. It looks like it is full of straight lines, but in reality, it is composed entirely of circles. The golden ratio is the ratio of the diameter of the parent circle to the distance of the child circle, and the ratio of the diameter of the parent circle to the diameter of the child circle. When the golden ratio is used, a straight line like this is produced. Conversely, if the golden ratio is not used, the upper right circle of the lower left circle and the upper left circle of the lower right circle will not overlap, resulting in a large number of smaller circles and a black line. By choosing the appropriate ratio, we have the phenomenon that the grandchildren's circles overlap exactly.
