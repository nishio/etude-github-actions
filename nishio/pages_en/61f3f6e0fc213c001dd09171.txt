from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Sensible people enjoy each other's company.

xi Raise up those who can teach.

Let friendly intercourse be the school of knowledge, and culture be taught through conversation. Thus you make friends your teachers, and mix the pleasures of conversation with the advantages of education. Thus, sensible people will take turns enjoying the pleasures. You will be applauded for what you say, and you will be taught from your own ears. We are always attracted to others by our own interests, which in this case are of a higher kind. The wise man frequents the mansions of the great nobility, not because they are temples of vanity, but as theaters of superior upbringing. There are gentlemen who have the credit of worldly wisdom, not only because they themselves are by their example and conduct models of all nobility, but also because the people around them form a well-formed academy of worldly wisdom of the best and noblest kind.
