DP D
[D - Knapsack 1 https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_d]
	The problem of maximizing value below a specified weight limit
　[Knapsack]
　DP with weight as the domain of definition and maximum value at that weight as the value.

	PyPy 166 ms
	Mistake forgetting to update the maximum weight case by forgetting +1 in `for j in range(W - weight + 1)`.
code:python
 def solve(N, W, WV):
     values = [0] * (W + 1)
     for i in range(N):
         next_values = values[:]
         weight, value = WV[i]
         for j in range(W - weight + 1):
             next_values[j + weight] = max(
                 values[j + weight],
                 values[j] + value)
         values = next_values
     return max(values)
