wage differential
	There are people who try to make you share in the wealth of those who get more than you do by claiming that "wage inequality is undesirable."
	[Global Rich List http://www.globalrichlist.com/]
	 A website that will tell you what percentage of the top in the world you are in if you put in your annual income.
	With an annual income of 1.03 million, the top 17%.
 So, if you make more than 1.03 million a year and you really believe that the wage gap is undesirable, then you should quickly distribute your wealth to the less fortunate 83% of the world!
	Most people can't face their own selfish desire to "want more" and just wrap it up with the words "disparity is not good."
