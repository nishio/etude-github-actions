(2.2) Prioritization of tasks is itself a difficult task
If there is no [task] to do today, you need to [choose a task] from the many tasks in the task list. Which one should you select and execute? For those situations, often there are many cases where you try to [prioritize] tasks. However, I am wondering if the [prioritization] works.

 [(2.2.1) A burden of sorting]
 [(2.2.2) We can not compare magnitude unless it is one dimension]
 [(2.2.3) We can not compare magnitude when there is an uncertain factor?]
 [(2.2.4) Prioritize important tasks]
 [(2.2.5) You do not have to determine the priority now]
