Reading [/rashitamemo/individuality in fragmentation] reminded me of [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers], p.155, which says that [group organization is subjective].
[Abstraction] is to [extract] what you [think] is important, and what you "[think]" is [important] is [subjective].

[Abstraction is subjective.]
