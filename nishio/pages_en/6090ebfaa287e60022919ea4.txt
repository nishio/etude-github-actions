 *1220399883*[Housework] Result of cooking rice
 - It is not sticky, but has a little more water. It doesn't look like okowa, but more like a little starch on the rice paddle. After mixing, I left the lid open to let the water evaporate a little.
 - Strong taste.
 - I was surprised that the color was quite brown.

 I have to go to work to get there but it's still too hot to put in the fridge. It's going to hurt if I leave it at room temperature. So what should I do? Well, I didn't dare to put it in the fridge without airing it out.

 Nishio thought that overall, you put too much emphasis on nutrition and too many ingredients.

 Or basically, the reason I cook for myself is to eat vegetables. Even if you try to eat vegetables at restaurants, it is difficult to find a restaurant that serves a large quantity of vegetables that have been cooked and reduced in bulk. Therefore, I don't dare to read the atmosphere and eat a lot of vegetables.
 
 Dinner today:
 - 1/4 cabbage
 - 1/2 tofu
 - Mackerel simmered in miso that I bought at a side dish shop
 
 Substituting cabbage and tofu for white rice is a common diet practice.

 <body>That's where freezing might have been a good idea! <br>I wonder if I'm the only one who thinks rice tastes better when it's frozen and "defrosted-eaten" rather than left in the fridge for a while. </body>

 <body>I think putting it in the freezer is a good idea. <BR>To cool the residual heat, you can use two different balls, one large and one small, and cool them in ice brine. <br>On the other hand, if you want to make a ball with high viscosity and strong flavor, you can make it into a rice ball, put it in the refrigerator, and then microwave it. </body>

 <body>You should also try implementing some of the life hacks in this entry and others! <br>http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kajuntk/20080713/1215905575<br>Nishio, I thought your overall emphasis was on nutrition and too many ingredients. </body>

 <body>Then I think you should make soup. <br>Soups are easy to make, yield large quantities of vegetables, and get all the nutrients from the vegetables without losing any of their nutritional value. <BR>And since it can be made in large quantities, lasts a long time, and is not a main dish, you can eat it every day and not get tired of it. <br>That's all from my wife. <br>I think you should buy a gas stove first.

 <body>Vegetables are important. Making it into a soup is also a good idea. You can either eat them side by side or over rice. </body> <body>
