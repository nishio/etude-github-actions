Average gold volume and turning force
[Dominion] Approach
[Average gold volume] and [rotational force].
I see.
　I had heard of the idea of an average gold volume.
　　That was when there wasn't much expansion yet, and the way I heard it was that it was strong (steroid strategy) to mainly use coins without buying too many kingdom cards.
　　　That's what kept me away from Dominion.
　　I guess with the recent expansion, there are more opportunities for combos.
　Oh, I've heard of the rotational force concept.
　　My understanding was something along the lines of, "Compression in the chapel is strong."
