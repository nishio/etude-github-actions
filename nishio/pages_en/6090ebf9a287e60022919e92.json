 *1218469813*[1000speakers]6th 1000 Speakers Conference @Kyushu
 I have made a presentation. For more information on the event: http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:6
 
 Well, this was the first time the event was held outside of Tokyo (Nagasaki), and it seems that Nagasaki Prefecture is quite active in supporting the engineering community, and the venue was very clean and well-equipped, but was rented free of charge. <a href='http://sasebo-jsp.jp/'>Sasebo Information Industry Plaza</a>. There was also the world's fastest 3D printer. I also casually looked at the <a href='http://www.pref.nagasaki.jp/shoukou/index.php'>Nagasaki Prefecture Department of Industry and Labor</a> website and saw that they were holding a "SOHO Fair 2008" to support SOHOs (small office home offices). to support SOHO (small office home office)! I got the impression that they are proactive in revitalizing the IT industry. It is wonderful. I wish other municipalities would do the same. I heard that it is very difficult to raise money and try not to make a deficit or a surplus, but if we could rent a conference room with a projector and network connection for free, it would make it much easier to hold a study session.
 
 
 The keynote speaker was Mr. Yamamoto of AIP Cafe, which I had never heard of. I guess it is similar to the "programmer's cafe" that id:dropdb and others in the Hatena area were talking about wanting to do, but this building itself is supposed to be a sort of tenement for programmers and designers! <a href='http://blog.cgfm.jp/garyu/archives/274'>AIP Cafe is finally OPEN! Rueda's Bar" is now open in Fukuoka! </a> If you think about it calmly, it would be more interesting to have people from various backgrounds than to have only web programmers, just as it would be meaningless to have only warriors in a bar in Rueda.

 I've learned the "Read more" and "Nico Nico Douga" Hatena notation, so I'll put it below so that people without a Nico Nico account can see all the videos.

 I've been thinking about graduating from one-liner stories, but I keep resorting to them because they are so easy to use (^^;).
