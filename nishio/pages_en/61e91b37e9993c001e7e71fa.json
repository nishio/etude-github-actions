(4.5.3.3) Make teaching materials
Making materials to teach other people also enhances your memories. After solving a [puzzle], if you write about how to solve that puzzle, the score of the next puzzle is significantly improved. You do not need to teach other people. It is effective only by making teaching materials.

(Di Stefano, G., Gino, F., Pisano, G. P., Staats, B., & Di-Stefano, G. (2014). Learning by thinking: How reflection aids performance. Boston: Harvard Business School.)

Given this, it would be beneficial to make the goal of reading to make materials for teaching others. Materials you have created to teach other people can also help you [review] them later. One year later you are a different person from you now.

Moreover, if you publish the material on the Internet, sometimes it is mentioned by others in [SNS]. It [trigger]s you to review. Materials that are beneficial to many people are mentioned more frequently. So those materials are reviewed and improved more frequently.

The reason why I wrote this book was similar. I published a lecture slides on the Internet in 2010. When you read a book and learn something, make slides or blog posts that teach other people about it. We sow seeds by publishing materials. The seeds gradually grow with receiving feedbacks. After years, your understanding grows into a big tree. Why not bet on this possibility?
