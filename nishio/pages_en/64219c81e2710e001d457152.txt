>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640056568195743744] Can language minorities survive?  GPT-4 performance for minority languages is lower compared to English. For example, Japanese lags by 5 points! Will this gap ever close? #LanguageMinorities #GPT4

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640056657182097410] If the gap doesn't close, we could see a productivity divide between those who can speak English with AI and those who can't. People might shift to using English instead of their native languages.  #LanguageShift #AIandLanguage

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640056842805182465] As you may know, I've resumed tweeting on my English account. Now I'm having a machine translate my Scrapbox entries into English. As a Japanese speaker, organizing thoughts in my native language is easier for me.  #LanguageBarrier

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640056968957272064] Not sure how to best utilize the English translations yet, but I'll be experimenting and learning along the way. Excited to see where this journey takes me!  #LanguageLearning #Multilingual

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640057101681823744] It's 27:30 in Japan right now . Thinking of using up my ChatGPT Plus quota before bed. This could be a great trigger and motivation for me to express my thoughts in English!  #LanguageLearning #ChatGPTPlus

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640057198205341697] Wish OpenAI would show the remaining quota for ChatGPT Plus users. It would be so helpful to manage usage better!

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640057336835510272] Big excitement in Japan today as Sam Altman's interview was aired!  Haven't watched it yet, but I read his 'American Equity' article and wrote a summary for Japanese readers.  #SamAltman #AmericanEquityblog.samaltman.com

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640057720320712704] Taxing companies based on market cap and accepting payment in stocks is an intriguing concept.  BTW, Japan had wealth taxes after the War, with extreme measures like bank closures and currency switches. #WealthTax #MarketCap https://moores.samaltman.com

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640057879251259392] But a gradual wealth tax increase up to 2.5% seems more reasonable. I didn't realize that Japan's current property tax is essentially a wealth tax on real estate. Learned something new!  #Japan #PropertyTax

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640058749477097474] Today's thought: We must take responsibility for our actions and do what we think is best. Nobody truly knows the 'right' answer. Those who answer confidently are just deciding it's best to be confident even when uncertain.  #LifeThoughts #Responsibility

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640059413204733954] To move quickly, we must be light on our feet.  #LifeLessons #Agility

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640059539419705344] Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards. We can't run fast while looking back. #Wisdom #ForwardThinking

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640059643610406912] Even if the past concerns us, maybe we shouldn't look back too much. A quick glance is okay, but fully turning around is not advisable. Keep moving forward!  #Progress #DontLookBack

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640067886709608448] Just read the Prompting Tips, and it's interesting to see that AIs, like humans, find it hard to understand negative instructions.

>[nishio_en https://twitter.com/nishio_en/status/1640067953155788801] Oops, it's already 28:00 here!  Surprisingly, I still have some ChatGPT Plus quota left. Time to call it a night, though.  #GoodNight #ChatGPTPlus
