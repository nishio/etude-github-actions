 *1271852659*[objc]To make UIAlertView blocking
 UIAlertViewDelegate protocol (interface in Java?) Use the
 >|objc|
 @interface MyClass : MotherClass <UIAlertViewDelegate>
 {
 ...
 }
 ||<
 
 This protocol guarantees the presence of the alertView method
 >||
 - (void)alertView:(UIAlertView *)alertView clickedButtonAtIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex{
 ...
 }
 ||<
 These areas are not difficult because the concept is the same as Java's event listeners, just the terminology is different.
 Also, it seems that all UIView children have an NSInteger tag, so it is standard practice to identify them with it.

 **1271853179*[objc]How to bind NSString
 I was looking into the possibility of joining NSString with + or something, and realized that it would be easier to use stringWithFormat than to join them.
 
 >|objc|
 NSString* msg = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d, %d, %d, %d", 
                  score[0], score[1], score[2], score[3]];

 *1271855352*cocos2d is useful
 I installed cocos2d the day before yesterday and said, "Wow, it's so easy! It was easy. And the parts that took time were UIAlertViewDelegate, arc4random, NSString: stringWithFormat, and so on, which had nothing to do with cocos2d at all... cocos2d is easy to understand.
 
 I tried to put the finished application on my iPhone, but my iPhone's OS is 3.1.3, and Xcode 3.1 supports only 3.1.2. And to get Xcode 3.2, I needed to install it on Snow Leopard. I will install it now.
 
 I definitely spent more time doing everything else than I did using cocos2d....
 
 *1271861409* When asked "Where are System Events?"
 After installing Snow Leopard, for some reason a mysterious "Choose Application" dialog popped up and asked me "Where are System Events?
 
 I couldn't figure out what they were asking for, but they said they couldn't find an application called "System Events" and wanted me to tell them where to find it. System/Library/CoreService/SystemEvents.app in Macintosh HD.

 *1271870248*(SOLVED)I created an iPhone app for the first time in a while and got Error launching remote program: security policy error.
 I have not created an iPhone app in a while and I got an Error launching remote program: security policy error. As it turns out, the problem is that the old Expired Provisioning is still there. I removed the Provisioning marked with a cross in the Summary of the organizer's DEVICES and it worked.
