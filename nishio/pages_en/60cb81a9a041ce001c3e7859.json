Advanced students help those who are seriously trying to get stronger.
In cooperative games, a good player will give serious and accurate pointers if "someone who is seriously trying to get better" asks for advice. This is because it is more beneficial for that person to get better.
However, they tend not to give advice unless explicitly asked for it. This is because we do not know how serious they are.

	>If you are really messed up and good, you can ask for advice and they will give you very serious and accurate pointers.
		>Because as long as we play together, if we have time to complain about our friends behind their backs, we should practice together during that time and let our friends get better at it, so that we can clear the game faster.
 > These people tend to say, "Tell me, point out everything!" They tend not to move on their own unless you say, "I'm not going to do it. If they don't see how serious they are, they know it will hurt them.

>nishio: I think I saw an article in the context of fighting games that said something like "it's the middle core who glares at others for their lack of effort, while the real experts help those who try to get stronger and don't care about those who don't"...
The "middle core" was "mid-core" not gaming.
