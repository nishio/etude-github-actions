 *1359121743* "The Dragon's School on the Mountain" and "The Dragon's Seven Cute Children"
 My wife, who loves cross-cultural sci-fi, has written "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4781605451/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN= 4781605451&linkCode=as2&tag=nishioyome-22">School of the Dragon is on the Mountain</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4047284084/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie =UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4047284084&linkCode=as2&tag=nishioyome-22">The Dragon's Cute Seven Children</a>". Both are collections of short stories. The former is set in "Utsunomiya University, the only university in Japan with a dragon department," and the latter is set in a world where humans are composed of two races, "ape-men (homo sapiens)," who look like us, and "horse-men (centaurs)," who do not. The dragons are now useless because they have been eradicated by machines, and the unemployment rate of the apes is rising because of the long working hours of the horsemen. The latter takes place in a world where there are "mermaids" who look like humans but cannot speak and are not that intelligent. There are people who say, "Mermaids have human rights," and there are people who are harmed by these activities.
 
 Both were quite interesting. If I had to choose which one was more interesting, I would probably pick "Dragon School on the Mountain". The story about the horse people and the story about the dragon faculty were particularly interesting. My wife said the story about the painter who materializes when he puts his eyes in the "cute seven children of the dragon" is interesting. She also said that the story about the horse people and the story about the dragon faculty were interesting. The story about the dragon faculty is interesting because it has the atmosphere of a science university like Moyashimon.
