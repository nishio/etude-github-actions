 *1192583358*Today is the day for recyclable garbage
 
 I threw away all the empty cans in the room; there were 52 of them.

 I thought I got an API key when I created "<a href="http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/blog/nishio/2007/06/pythonlingr.html">Yasukazu Nishio's Blog @ Cybozu Labs: Relaying the coding process with Lingr</a>" before. I must have done it before. I'll look for it.
 
 *1192624332* How to write renewal

 *1192632455*Master and Disciple
 The first one was clipped in anticipation of being the one of the day.
 
 The master split on frame 9 so he could win! It's exactly the same except there, but that's the only thing that changes yonjiten. I don't understand the bowling score calculation.
