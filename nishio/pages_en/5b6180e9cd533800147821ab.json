meta-
I don't use the word "meta" in [intellitech] because if I say "meta" carelessly, editors will ask me, "What do you mean?

It seems that the world is not a place where people can just say, "[Metacognition] is right, isn't it?
 [メタ認知 - 脳科学辞典 https://bsd.neuroinf.jp/wiki/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%BF%E8%AA%8D%E7%9F%A5]

If we start asking what "meta" is in the first place, we start talking about history again.
It is not essential to talk about metaphysics because it was the next chapter in physics.

In the first place, meta in the sense that meta-cognition is cognition against cognition, or was it metaphysica's relation to physica?

The abstract concept of "meta" is being used by itself. It is used in an ambiguous and appropriate way. We have to ask, "What do you mean by meta?" I have to ask around.

What do you mean by "meta" in metadata, or is it just ancillary data?

If I were to include it, it would be in one of the sections or columns that explain various aspects of abstraction.
