Knowledge and Courage
4 

Knowledge and courage are the elements of greatness. They confer immortality. For they are immortal. Each does as much as he knows, and the wise can do anything. Man without knowledge, the world without light. Wisdom and power, eyes and hands. [Knowledge without courage is] barren.
