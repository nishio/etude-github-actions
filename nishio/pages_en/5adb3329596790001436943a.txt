pumpkin
	There's a saying, "Think of it as talking to a pumpkin in a pumpkin patch" to help you not get nervous when giving a presentation.
 In [autistic] individuals, experiments have shown that when recognizing other people's faces, they do not use the areas that are used for face recognition in typically-developed individuals, but use the areas that are used for object recognition in typically-developed individuals.

	Perhaps you recognize it as a pumpkin as well as a pumpkin in the first place?
