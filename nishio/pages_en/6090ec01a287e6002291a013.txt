 <a href='http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/archives/51297456.html'>404 Blog Not Found:3 reasons why public statements should be arrogant</a>
 
 As for the first, I agree with you in the sense that "claims should be concise and clear" and "token respect and precautions such as "don't attack because it's subjective" only dilute the density of information," but the other two are different. The other two are different. They are not corrected strongly and promptly because they are arrogant; they are corrected strongly and promptly because they attract attention.
 
 If you write something wrong in an arrogant tone, you are more likely to be flamed than if you are not arrogant. Gaining attention through flames is one option. However
 
 - You need to be thick-skinned enough to write another entry even if you find out that what you wrote is wrong.
 - Need a high hit rate (even if you strike out once in a while) so people don't think "I'm just writing a bunch of crap."
 - You need to have the patience to not lose heart when people get emotional and act strange.
 
 It's a long and arduous road. It is not something I would recommend to everyone.

 **1254315222* What to look for when using fertilizer at Sunshine Ranch.
 I applied fertilizer to only one of the apples planted at about the same time. The remaining time until cotyledons appeared differed by only 5 minutes. When a stage is changed by fertilizer application, the time required for the next stage is not reduced. In other words, using fertilizer with less than one hour remaining before the next event is a waste of some fertilizer.
