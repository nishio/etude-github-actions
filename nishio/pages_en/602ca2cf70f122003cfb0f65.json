Lego Dimensions
The dimensions of [LEGO] are officially expressed as "2 x 2 x 1" or something similar, but 1 in the height direction is slightly longer than 1 in the horizontal direction.
This creates a misalignment when you start doing [SNOT]. I want to understand this properly, not just "something is a little off.

It is convenient to use 0.8mm as a unit. 1U = 0.8mm
　One horizontal unit is 10U
　　Sometimes this is called one stud.
　Heightwise, 12U for blocks, 4U for plates
　　This is sometimes referred to as 1H
　Stud (projection) height is 2U, diameter is 6U, gap is 4U
　Pin holes are 6U so studs can be inserted
　2U for thin sections of brackets and headlights, and 2U for wall thicknesses such as blocks
　The headlight recess is 2U, so a 4U plate would make it 12U.

consideration
 I've seen some diagrams that use 1.6mm as one unit, but then I get 0.5 units.
 　If 0.8mm is one unit, it becomes an integer.
 One stud is 10U, which is easy to understand.
 　Slightly longer verticals are multiples of 3 following 10, 12

This figure shows 0.5 because 2U is one unit.

 Studs are 0.1mm longer than 2U and blocks are 0.2mm skinnier than 10U
