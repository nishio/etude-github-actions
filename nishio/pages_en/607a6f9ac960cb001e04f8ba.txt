I see people who introduce other companies' good initiatives and say, "You're a competitor.
>For an individual, "company" is just a temporary attribute in life, but "what you think is good" is for life, so it is natural that the latter takes precedence over the former.

> The [knowledge worker] of the future will live longer than the organization to which he belongs. [Drucker] says that we must first design our lives on this basis.
