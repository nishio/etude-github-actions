Metaverse for those who don't like to communicate
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1466274971718586377]: [metaverse] for people who don't like to communicate with others, a world where you can like every block in [mycla] and the person who placed the block will be notified of the number of likes ([Death Stranding]-ization). I talked about a world where you can like every block in [Mycla] and the person who placed the block will be notified of the number of likes (Death Stranding-ization).
　>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1466275260974522369]: if you can like the signs, not to mention all the blocks?

context
　Wife: "I'm interested in [VRChat], but I don't want to be talked to."
　I said, "Maybe it's [Minecraft]."
　My wife "would prefer at least a gradual communication through installations and likes like [Death Stranding]."
　I said, "Maybe Minecraft should have a like feature."

[I don't want to communicate.]
