compliment a private conversation
 I was chatting with Dr. Shiozawa and it was interesting, so I made a note of it.
 In a class for high school students, when there is a lack of response to questions
  Common in college students.
 First, basically reduce the difficulty of the question.
  Open question
  Raise your hand at the question of choice.
  Raise your hand at the two-choice question
  Asking ridiculously easy questions to elicit hand-raising behavior.
 What if the response is not good, or what if the principle is not good enough?
  I tended to give up when there was nothing I could do.
 compliment a private conversation
  Cases where the student does not speak to the teacher, but is talking privately to his/her peers about what is being said in class.
  Praise this
  A situation in which there is a widespread false belief in the class that it is good to shut up and listen quietly.
  Usually it is probably the students who talk privately who are offended.
  But I commend you for that.
  This is because, in classes after college, the attitude of "only receiving information one way and not speaking up" is not beneficial.
  Perhaps the type of student who usually speaks up has not had the experience of having his or her comments received by the teacher, and learned helplessness
  By accepting and positively evaluating, they begin to vividly contribute to the class.

 The story of this.
