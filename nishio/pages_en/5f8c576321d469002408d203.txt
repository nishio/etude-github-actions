	Thoughts.
	　If the remainder of the range from i to j is known, then multiply by 10, add one digit, and take the remainder in constant time
	　But if we wait for too much for each starting point, the total is of the order of squares.
	　So we can make this a [frequency table] of constant width.
	　 PS, it is indeed a constant, but it's 2019 x 200000, so it's going to TLE.

　Official Explanation
　　A slightly different approach
　　It's similar to doing operations on a range with cumulative sums and inverse operations.
　　　I thought about it a little when I was considering it per se, but I mistakenly thought it was a no-no.

			[$ x \equiv A_j - A_i \times 10^{j-i} \pmod{2019} ] 
			　Quickly assume that the power of 10 part is in the way and cannot be used.
			Cumulative from the left, not from the right
			　That's more natural since it's a number of digits, not a sequence of numbers.

				[$ x \times 10^{i-j} \equiv B_i - B_j  \pmod{2019} ] 

			　I'm only interested in whether the remainder of x is zero in this problem.
			　Multiplication by powers of 10 can be ignored because 10 is prime to 2019.
　　From left to right: Accumulation -> [Frequency -> Triangle Number].
