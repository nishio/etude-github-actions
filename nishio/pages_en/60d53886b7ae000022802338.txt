List of human bugs
As part of the collection of [human bugs
I was going to refer to [the list of fallacies], but before I do, I have a few tidbits.
 The bug that when given a long list, thinks that's all there is.
　The bug that makes you think that when you and others use the same word, they mean exactly the same thing as you do.
　Bugs that make you think you are thinking normally.
