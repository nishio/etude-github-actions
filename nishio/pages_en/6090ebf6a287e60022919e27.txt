 Lease fees are 70,000 yen per month for individuals and 200,000 yen per month for facilities. The company expects to use the system at nursing care facilities, rehabilitation facilities for the physically handicapped, and manufacturing facilities.
 
 　The Robot Suit senses the electrical signals that are transmitted from the brain to the muscles through nerves that are generated when humans move their bodies. The electric motors move faster than the muscles, enabling, for example, women and the elderly to lift heavy objects.
