This is great. It's stable.

The [tile 2 x 2 - center stud] was only green and the bar and dish were only white, so the color is wrong, but that will arrive tomorrow

The [figure-top curve] fits just right on the back of the head.

A [clip bar] grows out of the hole in the side of the [side stud block], and the clip bar does double duty as a bar to hold the [T-pipe] and to be held by the [tile clip].
　[side stud - clip bar - clip]
　[Side studs - clip bar - T-pipe]

T-pipes use [center studs] and [open studs] to form a [concave stud - open stud - T-pipe] pattern.
