Systematization of the unknown
[Technologist Requirements] sec. 1
 >How do we systematize the unknown?
 >Typical of this is Mendeleev's discovery of the periodic table. He did not systematize the known. He considered what unknowns must be assumed to bring order to the known elements.

  Drucker's "systematization of the unknown" is predicated on "systematizing"
  　But have we actually systematized the unknown?
  　What exactly did Mendeleev do?
  　　Known items sorted and arranged by nature and weight.
  　　I didn't think "everything we know" at the time, but assumed "there are unknowns" and laid them out, and here's the great thing.
  　　[assuming the existence of the unknown].
  　This would be a case where there was already a sufficient amount of "knowns" that we could find "holes" by systematizing them!
  I didn't "systematize" the unknown.
  　Through systematization, they discovered the unknown.
  　Means and Objectives
  　　Systematization is not an end but a means to discovery
  [Blind spot card]
  　This was created to see if we could assist in finding blind spots.
