Appropriate length device
	Writing on sticky notes is a deterrent to not writing [long sentences].
	On the other hand, there is often a pattern of writing only words, like "sticky notes" or "short sentences.
 	Not an instant no-no, but better to fatten them up.
 	Sticky notes won't prevent this.

 If it was to create a KJ method support system,
 	Let them write out short or long sentences without worrying about it anyway, and the system will ask them
	 This is kind of long, but in a nutshell, what does it mean?"
	 I know this is short, but what would you like to say to make up for it?"

I'll try to keep it short.
	Sticky note is not a long deterrent
	Sticky notes do not deter those that are too short.
	Write first without worrying about length.
	The system asks questions and makes them of reasonable length.
