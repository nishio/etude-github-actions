 The method of [summarizing thoughts] introduced by [Tadao Umesao] in [The Art of Intellectual Production]. p.202
	>The following techniques may be useful in constructing coherent thoughts and sentences.
	>First, prepare a piece of paper...
	>On each sheet of paper, write a word, phrase, or short sentence related to the subject at hand, one entry per sheet. Write as you think of them, in any order...
	>When you've done it all, put the scraps of paper on your desk or on your tatami mat....
	>Look at each piece of paper one by one and see if there are any other pieces of paper that are connected to it. If there are, place them together. If there are any, place them together. At this point, never categorize the pieces of paper.
	>When you have a group of sheets of paper, put them together in an order that seems to make logical sense. Then, I fold the edges over and staple them together. This established an idea. I call the resulting series of scraps of paper a "kozane.

	Compared to the flow of the [KJ method] introduced in [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers]:...
 	Write down what comes to mind [the write down method].
  Arrange them side by side for better listing.
  Instead of categorizing, find pieces of paper that are connected and put them together.
  Arrange them in the order in which they make sense.
 The KJ method involves putting pieces of connected paper together and then trying to explain them orally to see if the stories connect.
 The Kozane method is a physical arrangement.
 The KJ method makes a front cover after this, but that is not done in the Kozane method.

		[Scrapbox] and the Kozane Law are intertwined.
  Kozane method is a method proposed in [Technology of Intellectual Production

 What I do with sticky notes when I write or prepare lecture materials is almost the same as the Kozane method.
  I learned from Jiro Kawakita, though.
  Kozane method does up to [grouping] of [KJ method] and corresponds to the ones that do not wear a nameplate.

 He wrote that, too. p. 206.
  >This method had been gradually developed among our colleagues for quite some time. However, it was Jiro Kawakita, a professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology and famous as the founder of the KJ method, who developed it into a very sophisticated technique, both in theory and practice.
  >The KJ method, named after his initials, has recently been attracting a great deal of attention as a systematic technique for finding meaningful combinations from heterogeneous data. In particular, it is highly regarded as a method for "gathering the collective knowledge" of multiple people, and seems to be put to practical use by various companies. The Kozane method, which I have introduced here, is a closed-door intellectual production technique for a few individuals, and in Kawakita's system, it is a relatively simple and rudimentary technique. In Kawakita's system, it is almost the same as what is called "KJ method B" writing.
  [nishio.icon] believes in "originality first before co-creation," so we believe that the KJ method should be used for intellectual production by a single individual before "[gathering] public knowledge. In this respect, the direction is similar to that of the Kozane Method.

 In the early days when I started using Scrapbox, I too was aware that a page was the equivalent of a piece of "kozane" paper and complained, "Why do you force me to have a title?" and "Can't I change the order by myself?
 I began to view granularity differently and began to think that "Scrapbox titles are the equivalent of tableplates in the KJ method (for a bundle of multiple cards).
