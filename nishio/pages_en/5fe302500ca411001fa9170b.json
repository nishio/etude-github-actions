A value is added or deleted to a set. I want to get the smallest value.
â†’ Prepare a heapq that contains the deleted values and skip reading it when acquiring.
code:python
 from heapq import *
 
 added = []
 removed = []
 # add
 heappush(added, 1)
 heappush(added, 2)
 # remove
 heappush(removed, 1)
 # get top
 while removed and added[0] == removed[0]:
     heappop(added)
     heappop(removed)
 
 print(added[0])  # => 2
