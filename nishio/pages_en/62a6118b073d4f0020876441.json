  >>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1535899909588930560 @nishio]: I made the mistake of dropping my AirPods case from my pocket when I got on the train for the first time in a while. I had just given up my seat to an old lady who told me I dropped it, so I was safe. I guess this is what they call "mercy is good for no one".
 >No, no, no, wait, is it bad sense to try to use "mercy is not for other people" (7,5) in its original form?
 > "It's falling down" AirPods in the seat I gave up, I gained about 20,000 yen.

	[It is not difficult to overtake those who avoid making the effort to excel.]
