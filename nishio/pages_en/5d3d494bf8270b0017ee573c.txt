The world closes in on the naysayers.
	A variant of [The world of those who kill does not expand
	I associate it with writing [a person who, when he wants to praise something, belittles something else].
	The act of belittling the entirety of "people who have attribute X."
		Attributes are, for example, nationality, race, gender, occupation, political party support, faith, and so on.
	People who "know someone with attribute X" don't belittle the entire population of people with attribute X.
		Even if some people with attribute X are bad, not all people with attribute X are bad.
	From here, if it is observed that a person A is belittling "all people with attribute X", then
		Which leads to the conclusion that "A's world is small and does not include people with attribute X."
	This situation is reinforced
		People with attribute X do not want to have a relationship with A

	[Positive feedback]
