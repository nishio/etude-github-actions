	The [Shortest Path] Problem and LP
		Special case of minimum cost flow
		ã€€If there is enough capacity on the edges and the distance is a cost, the cost of one flow and the distance in the shortest path in the original graph match.
		[Differential constraints], colloquially known as [cattle games](POJ3169(Layout))
	The [maximum flow] problem and LP
		[maximum flow minimum cut theorem]
		[Maximum circulating flow] problem
	[Minimum Cost Flow] and LP
		Minimum Cost Circulating Flow] Problem with Minimum Flow Constraints
		Potential difference maximization problem under difference constraints
		[Project Selection Problem]

[dual linear programming problem].
