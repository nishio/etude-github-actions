Illustration of the concept acquisition process
The process of acquiring the concept through conversation with my wife was so interesting that I wrote about it on Facebook, and some people said I had to illustrate it, so I illustrated it.

The upper left corner first organizes the premise. ["ha" is not only "=" but also "âŠ‚"].

	1: The topic of kinpa comes up. The concept of kinpa was vague, so I try to confirm it.
  Wife: "I'll buy some kimbap in front of the station today."
  I said, "Is kinpa a seaweed roll?"
		Wife: "Yes."

	2: Myeongdong laver rolls are mentioned. I implicitly guessed that Myeongdong Laver Rolls are a subset of Nori Rolls based on the structure of the name, but I don't understand the relationship between Myeongdong Laver Rolls and Kimbap, so I ask a question.
 	Is kimbap a Myeongdong laver roll?" No.

	3: A negative was returned to the question, so we wonder if the relationship is reversed.
 	[X is not Y -> Y is X?].
  I said, "Myeongdong seaweed rolls are kimbap?"

  I somehow wrote this [$ \not \subset ] usage is not correct.
  	[$ \forall x \in X, x \notin Y ] intention
  	[X is not Y]
  An [unnamed concept] is used that would be "part of the products of a restaurant named Myeongdong Noriwaki," if we dare to verbalize it.

	5 My understanding is complete with this answer.

Today's Nishio Family (Process of Concept Acquisition)
Wife: "I'll buy some kimbap in front of the station today."
I said, "The kinpas are...um, seaweed rolls?"
Wife: "yes, compare to the one I bought at Myeongdong Seaweed Rolls."
I said, "Is the kimbap a Myeongdong seaweed roll?"
Wife: "No."
I said, "Myeongdong seaweed rolls are kimbap?"
My wife said, "You can say that it is and it is not. Myeongdong Laver Roll is both the name of the restaurant and its flagship product."
I said, "Does the term Myeongdong Laver Roll refer to both the store and the product? Is Myeongdong Laver Roll a store that sells kimbap?"
Wife: "No. I sell more than just kimbap."
