What is Unexplored Software Creation Project?
>The way the IPA has been subsidizing software has been changing little by little since the early 1990s, but the so-called Maekawa Report, sent by [Toru] Maekawa, Director of the IPA Technical Center (now a professor at Waseda University) from the West Coast, where he was on a business trip, further encouraged us to create a mechanism to produce super-hackers in Japan. The so-called "Maekawa Report" sent from the West Coast, where he was on a business trip, further encouraged him (or so I heard) to create a mechanism to produce super hackers in Japan. This was an advocacy of a Copernican turn of the government's logic, which is to shift the target of the subsidy from companies to individuals.
> And the times have sent the winds to turn it around. The Act on Special Measures for Industrial Revitalization ([Japanese version of the Bayh-Dole Act]) was passed. This law has made the mechanism for industrial revitalization in Japan more dynamic. It also opened a new wind in the way subsidies are used.
> In 1999, under the leadership of MITI Minister Kaoru Yosano, a team led by Assistant Director Takahiro Hagiwara of the Information and Communication Technology Division of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), who loves personal computers, finally formulated the "Super Hacker Project," and in July 2000 (after some twists and turns, I hear) the "Unexplored Software Creation Project" was launched to discover super creators. The project started in July 2000 as the "Unexplored Software Creation Project" to discover super creators.
