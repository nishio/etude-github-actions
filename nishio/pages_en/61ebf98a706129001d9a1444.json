活動履歴は市場調達困難な財
Ten years of [activity history] takes ten years to make.
Cannot be created later when demand arises.
　Money cannot be procured from the market.
　　For individuals
　　For the organization, "We are pleased to have Mr. X, who has been active in ~ for many years, join our membership!" can be a game play that says
　　　This is [market procurement].
　　　It has some foil effect, but I think most people think of it as just Mr. X's personal activities.
　So it's a source of [competitive advantage].
　[goods belonging to individuals].
　　Whether "the content of the activity can be attributed to an individual" for individual individuals and activities depends on the circumstances.
　　There are situations that can be attributed, but people don't.
　　Some people manage information in a messy and scattered way.

I learned something like that from [the contemporary art business].
