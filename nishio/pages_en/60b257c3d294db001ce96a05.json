Problem-solving tools change the state of the art.

Problem solver changes the state of one range X to the state of another range Y
Hopefully there is someone in this range X who is in pain and the change in condition will eliminate their pain.
That solves the problem.

However, here are two untested hypotheses
　1: Is there a customer in range X?
　2: Will customers be satisfied with Range Y?

[Solving Problem Y with Means X to Make Customer Z Happy] diagram in depth.
　Note that X and Y are prefixed with overlapping variable names.
　There are two types of problems: the ones you just think of in your head, and the ones your specific customer Z is having.
　The specific problem is [the gap between ideal and reality
　Problem solving measure X has range X and range Y
　　If the customer's reality is not in scope X or the ideal is not in scope Y, then means X by itself cannot solve the problem.
　　A combination of other things could solve the problem.
　Focusing on one customer and making what that customer wants anyway is one option, but I don't recommend it.
　　It's a way to move forward anyway when there is no other option.
　　The method [to create something you will use] is to focus on one customer, yourself, anyway.
　　Better than fluffing around without customers and making something no one wants.
　First, observe the distribution of customer distress, then consider a problem-solving measure that has a range X where there are many people.

　　Why we do it
　　Unlike when the means of problem solving is human labor, software has good features
　　The effort to create one can solve the problems of multiple people.
　　Then you're solving more problems per effort if you're solving problems where there's more than one person in the group.
