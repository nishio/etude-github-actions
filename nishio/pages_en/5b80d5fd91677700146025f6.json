hyper-organized notebook
I used this notebook until 2010.
My wife recommended me to switch to [Traveler's Notebook], so it is no longer used.
Then it was shoved in my emergency bag, but in the summer of 2018 I asked, "Is it appropriate to have it here?" I was asked, so I took it out and looked at it.

Many fans are against the shape of A4 folded into four, and the schedule column is long horizontally on a weekly basis, but I didn't have that many schedules at that time (I put stickies to hide schedules that I couldn't show).

I used to carry [leveraged notes] around and review them, taking advantage of the fact that I could insert a printout in A4, but eventually I got to 8 sheets and started to think that this was not possible!

 The first military note is not only about ideas, but also about information
