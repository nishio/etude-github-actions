 *1488270296* Difference between unexplored meeting and unexplored night.
 Digital signage for the Unexplored Conference seems to be seen at train stations everywhere, and there is a lot of talk about it. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the confusion that often arises between "unexplored meetings" and "unexplored nights.

 The Unexplored Conference is a fully invitation-only event; those without an invitation cannot attend. It will be broadcast live on Nico Live, so anyone can watch it online. There is also an option of public viewing at satellite venues, but I have never attended one, so I don't know.

 Unexplored Night is a social event mainly for Unexplored alumni, held after the Unexplored Conference at the same venue on the same day. It is open to all MIPRO related persons and those invited to the MIPRO Conference.
