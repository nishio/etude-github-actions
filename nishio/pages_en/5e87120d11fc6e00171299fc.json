discussion
	When a path in a group is lassoed, which should be selected, the path or the group?
	In the past, the paths were top of the line.
		If you didn't explicitly group them, they didn't join the group.
		By then the yellow frame was out.
	Transparent background for groups containing only paths.
		At that timing, only the transparent group is used to apply the hit judgment of the child element in the recurrence call.
		As a result, "the phenomenon occurred that a path in a group was selected and no group was selected.
	If some of the paths move despite grouping
		Expect the whole thing to move, move it, separate it, and frustrate.

Currently, it is difficult to distinguish between paths that are not grouped and those that are.
　Because [Groups containing only paths have transparent backgrounds
　Currently, there is no highlighting in the selected state, so it's hard to tell how much is selected.
　Highlighting makes the difference clear.
　TODO [highlight selection].
