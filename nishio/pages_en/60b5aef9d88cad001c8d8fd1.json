Bending the ankle causes the toes to bow.
I assumed that of course that would be the case, but he said that was a bad idea.
Bend and stretch after grabbing something with your toes to prevent warping.
If it's a "C", it doesn't bend at all, if it's an inverted "C", it touches the fingertips.

This stretch works pretty well, but I feel like it's working the [hamstrings], not the calves.

[Stretch]
[Calf.]
[ankle range of motion].
