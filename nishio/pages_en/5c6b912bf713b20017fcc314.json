verb form rather than noun form
Instead of writing "production equipment goes into service," it would be better to write "production equipment goes into service."
It is not yet clear what the sense of this goodness is or when it is best to do this.

Avoiding [preoccupation with noun forms
　Noun forms tend to be abstract
　[You must drink...]

[verb to explain].
　[actively bracketing the verb].
　[Focus on verbs to see strengths].
　[experience = verb].

[Sentences rot from adjectives]
