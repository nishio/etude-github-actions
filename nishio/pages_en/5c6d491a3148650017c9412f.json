	Concepts in [nodal point of thought 2019-02-18].
	The [recommendation] engine for similar entries is "long text to long text".
	[Search] is "Keyword -> Long Text".
	The Scrapbox link display is
		Page -> keywords contained on that page -> pages containing those keywords."
		In other words, it can be interpreted as a combination of "long text -> keywords" and "keywords -> long text".
		[2-hop link] did it twice more
	Given the idea that Scrapbox is a [stock of associations], this process is [associations].
	This associative connection is a virtual directed graph
	A few steps of exploration of this graph will generally result in a very wide distribution
	So the approach of "presenting a few randomly selected items that have been explored for a few steps" doesn't really produce anything very useful.
	As I thought of in [nodal point of thought 2019-02-18], we can treat this association to connect as [distance], and it might be useful in that usage
	Maybe we should take some time to re-think this discussion.

	I feel we are one step closer to realizing [the knowledge weaving program].
