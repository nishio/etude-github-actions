(4.5.2) Reading is a means, not a purpose
Reading is a [means]. It is not always a [purpose]. If it is a means, to think the [achievement condition] of the means is nonsense.

When you think "I have to read this book",  you [consider the means as the purpose] unconsciously. Is your original purpose the reading? [What would you like to have happened] by reading the book? Let's clarify the real purpose.

To help you clarify the purpose, I show you several types of purpose.

 [(4.5.2.2) Make connections]
