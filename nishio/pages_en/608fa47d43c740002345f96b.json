military-civilian fusion
[Defense White Paper 2020, p.57
>What is "military-civilian fusion"?
> The integration of the military and civilian sectors is an initiative that China has been promoting as a national strategy in recent years. In addition to the conventional defense mobilization system designed for emergency situations, it is said to promote the military use of civilian resources and the conversion of military technology to civilian use on a regular basis, not limited to emergency situations.
> In particular, efforts in what are considered "emerging areas" for China, such as maritime, space, cyber, and artificial intelligence (AI), have been identified as priority areas for military-private sector integration.

That's totally different from Japan's "[research that cannot be used for military purposes]".
>In 2015, the Ministry of Defense launched the "Research Promotion System for Security Technology" to fund basic research on military technology, and in 2005, the Science Council of Japan issued a statement opposing the system, expressing concern that "academia and the military are getting closer.
>The debate over the system at the time was based on the premise that it is unreasonable to divide advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and information and communications into military and civilian applications, and that the latest scientific technologies should be dual-use (military and civilian). The starting point was the fear that the continued opposition of the council to military research would restrict the free thinking of researchers and bring Japanese science to a standstill.
