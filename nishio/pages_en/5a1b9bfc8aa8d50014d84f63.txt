Feedback Analysis
Feedback analysis is useful to observe discrepancies with goals written a year or six months ago, but I often hear of cases where supervisors try to use it to assess their subordinates, creating a [risk-averse] bias. This may overlook the original premise of [Drucker], who promoted feedback analysis. [Knowledge workers] must manage themselves.

>They cannot directly or closely supervise knowledge workers. They can only provide them with assistance. Knowledge workers must manage themselves. They must manage themselves so that their work will lead to performance and contribution, that is, to results.
[Professional Conditions].
