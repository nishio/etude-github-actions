 	[Time Management Matrix]

	[Urgent] is "something that appears to require immediate attention."
 [Important] is "tied to [the achievement of] your [mission], [values], and [priority] high [goals]."

	When time is [invested] in the second area (not urgent but important), [effectiveness] increases and the first area (urgent and important) decreases.
	The time to do the second area can only be taken away from the third or fourth area.
		That would mean saying "no."
	The first and third will work, but the second will not. You have to be [proactive] to do it.


Urgent = [Interrupt].
Measure and avoid interruptions -> [Pomodoro Technique].

It is also called the [Eisenhower Matrix]. However, there is no evidence that Eisenhower used this.
	His statements are often mentioned as the basis
		>The most urgent decisions are seldom the most important ones.

[People who achieve great results focus on opportunities, not problems.]
