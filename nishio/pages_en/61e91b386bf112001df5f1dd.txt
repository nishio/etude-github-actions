Footnote for 4.5.2.3
Footnote for [(4.5.2.3) Get the tools of thinking]

When I was writing this section, I realized that I described my concepts with combinations of simple words, without coinciding new words. I did it unconsciously. It is because I intend to translate this book into English. If I make a new word based on Japanese pronunciation, it is difficult to translate into other languages.

Additional footnote during translation:

In the process of translating my Japanese sentences into English by myself, I found some Japanese words difficult to convert into English.

Because I used [Scrapbox], I created a new page to explain the concept that the word indicates. After that, I am interested in why this phenomenon happens. I am a native Japanese speaker and a non-native English speaker. So the volume of knowledge in Japanese and English differs. The phenomenon is a kind of the pettern [I took the top box of the pyramid but it is different from my expectation]. I need to add supporting boxes.

I also think I should add boxes by myself, not by asking help with a native speaker. A non-native speaker, me, does not have a suitable word to express the concept. The fact indicates, even if a native speaker expresses the concept by a single word in English, other non-native readers have difficulty to understand the concept.
