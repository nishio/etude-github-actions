#Management Games

	Go is a management game
 	It is more efficient to scatter them sparsely than to enclose them.
   As a metaphor for research and development
  Compete for efficiency in acquiring "land" by consuming a limited resource of "moves".
  Games that pursue the optimal allocation of resources
  The more efficient management wins.
 It doesn't feel like an innovation game.
 	Games that go for market share
  It is a game of positioning ([Michael Porter] style management theory).
	Go is a game of total optimization, not local optimization
 Go has a constant initial value, and because there is no element of luck, it has been pushed too far into the history of the game. The truth is that there are random resources and unobservable areas with initial values (Civilization-like).
	The more you work on eliminating the weak areas, the more weak areas you will have.
 Unlike Shogi, Go has equal strength frames, so there is no easy-to-understand "area of focus".
