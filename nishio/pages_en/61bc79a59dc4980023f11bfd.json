	Small is Beautiful
	F. Ernst [Schumacher].

>In 1973, the oil crisis that Schumacher warned about in his book quickly became a reality, and the book became an international bestseller and a "prophet of our time. The book is now a popular phrase among those who seek a truly new human society, as it blows apart the roots of industrial society that transcends the system, while striking out at the material supremacy and the faith in science and technology that underlie modern civilization. A long-awaited new translation of this masterpiece of modern intellectual innovation!
