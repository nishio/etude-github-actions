Expanding what you can do creates what you want to do.

	I can't do it now, but I want to.
	What you "want to do" is not necessarily part of what you "can do" at this point in time.
	Doing something expands what you "can do".
	There's an X in that widened range.
	Sometimes, after realizing this, they say, "I want to do X."

具体例　
	I was shown cutting a tree with a band saw.
	I thought it was only big factories or something that could curve wood.
	I never thought I would be allowed to use such a community center.
	If wood can be cut in curves, can't you make something like this? I want to make it!
