Programmatic "What is Understanding?"
"Must be able to be implemented as a program."
　This is a variant of the non-programmer's statement that "understanding is being able to explain in one's own words".
　　What can be explained by [the artificial language of programming].
　Also related to what non-programmers say about being able to teach others.
　　That "others" are not homo sapiens [silicon intelligences].
