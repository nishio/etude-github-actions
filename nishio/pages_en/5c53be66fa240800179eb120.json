	Comparing writing a new book to translating one's own book, the former is an act of hooking and pulling out something that has not yet been put into words but is a blur inside of you with the [hook] of language, whereas the...
 	After writing all this, I felt it was not appropriate to use one word to describe "[translation]"
			When the author and the translator are different, there is a phase where "the translator reads the original text and understands what the author wanted to say," but in my case, the author and the translator are equal.
 	 So it's much different as an activity.
	 Writing a report and creating a presentation document are different formats, so new ideas can arise during conversion, similar to
	 ã€€[Format change]
 A sense about the correctness of the translation, in my case, I am the author, so it is canonical to judge based on my own non-verbalized sense.
 	On the other hand, if the translator differs from the author, "the author's ideas based on the text" is my personal interpretation, so if I feel uncomfortable or uneasy, I give priority to the agreement with the "institutionalized text".
 It is very interesting to observe and log this relatively rare activity and look back on it later!
 What is "translation"?
 Mapping concepts and words as handles for them to the iceberg model

 	When you look at the translations that have been converted by dictionaries, machine translations, and other people, [a feeling of discomfort] arises.
		This corresponds to the verification phase
		A kind of learning through dialogue with the outside world
		Matching with dictionaries was mentioned in the [TAE] story.

	 The [literal translation] doesn't feel right, it's a form of "[taking the top of the pyramid] is not what I expected."
 	When I was learning, I knew what knowledge I needed to gain by focusing on this gap.
 	On the other hand, if the author himself is translating his own book, the "answer" is "what the author wants to express", so it is inside, not outside
	Skills cannot be [duplicated] # duplicated

		[Sticky note is not the body.]
		The word is not the body either.
		Mr. A wrote the output in English, Mr. B read it and translated it into Japanese, and Mr. C read it and wrote the Japanese text.
		When this Japanese is translated into English again, it does not necessarily match the English words written by Mr. A in the first place
		The question is whether it should be matched.
		What was the word that Mr. A outputted?" is concrete data, not what Mr. C wanted to express.
		= word is not the main body
		In fact, in my case, I chose the older translation "Put first things first" knowing that in the original book of the 7 Habits, the latest translation is "Put first things first" and "Put first important things first".
			That history is clearly stated in a footnote.
		It doesn't matter what words the original author chose.
		It is important that the content of C's message be conveyed appropriately.



>Speaking of the "read fast" and "read slow" gradient, translating my own writing is significantly slower than my reading, as I am currently making progress at the rate of 3-5 pages per day.

>What does it mean to "learn"? What is "reading"? I've been digging into these questions, but by translating my own book into English, I realized that there are still some words that I have implicitly [thought I understood]. What are "values?" What is "deciding appropriately?"

>One good thing about going through my book and translating it into English on Scrapbox is that references like "This is a story I saw in a chapter" are links to specific pages in Scrapbox. The page title includes the section heading, so it's easy to remember without having to follow the link, and it's easy for people who couldn't remember to follow it back and read it again, which has the effect of page 87, "Test and then learn more."
