Highway Network
	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00387.pdf
	There are non-linear transformations F, G, and
 [$ z = F(y) \otimes G(y) + y \otimes (1 - G(y)) ]
		G is made to return a value in the range 0 to 1, which is a mixing factor between passing y through bare (0) or using only F(y) (1)

Residual Block
	[ResNet] configuration block
 In comparison to Highway Network.
 [$ z = F(y) + y ]
 Mixing ratio fixed at 1:1
		Is "mixing" a bad word because it's misleading as if it's 0.5 and 0.5?
  As the name "Residual" implies, F learns z-y: [$ F(y) = z - y].
