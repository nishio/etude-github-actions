 He was thrusting so hard that I asked him, "Wait, wait a minute, we'll continue another time," and ran back to the house.
 - What is a repository, a place to keep track of changes?
 - Where should I rewrite this?" "The &lt;name>" "Well, you should italicize it, or change the color, or at least make it Japanese. It should be grayed out, or you'll end up typing in brackets.
 - "You need to box the commands, change the typeface, or add prompts."
 - What does it mean to commit? To put the changelog in the repository.
 - "Why the 'first' commit? Is there a 'last' commit?"
 - "Change the color of the commentary in the comments."
 - "Where's the 'can I .git it'? Can I make it on a moment's notice? You're not always at home." "In the directory you're in. What happens if I git init twice? The second time, you should get an error message saying, "It's already there!
 - "Register with add, commit.... Why do it twice?"(trying to explain by pointing to the top right head)
 - Where is the stash?" "We don't have it yet." "Can you do it right away?" "No, that's advanced. That's like explaining 1 x 3 to a toddler who is counting one, two, three apples.
 - What is the range of your machine? Is it an inner square or an outer square?" "Outer" "Then don't write it here, people associate it with the closer one.
 - "So what's the relationship between the repository and the index, in this diagram there's an index in .git, but in this diagram the repository and the index are side by side."
 - There is no file called repository, there is no file called work tree, but there is a file called index, but maybe it's a different level of concept.
 - "What happens when I add, where exactly, does index write something to the file?" Yes, and what do you mean it writes to the repository?
 - Why do I have to add and commit? Isn't there some convenient command that does it in one step?" There is, git commit -a (note: incorrect answer, this will not add a file that has never been added). semantically, these two changes have different purposes and we want to record them separately.
 - "It's so annoying when there are so many files to add, can I just write them all down?" I thought you could use wildcards, or only one wildcard.
 - "The index poses the philosophical question, 'I am both inside and outside.' ' I am both a file and a concept!"
 In the meantime, I have transcribed what I frantically wrote down. I will revise it tomorrow.
 
 Q: Is the index in or out of the repository?
 A: Is it OK to conclude that there are indexes and objects (object databases) in the repository, but that the practice of calling these objects "repositories" is confusing to first-time users?
