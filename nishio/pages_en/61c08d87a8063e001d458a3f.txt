Weakness of bullet points
Example
　A
　 B
　 C
　 D

This is because the BCD
code:lisp
 (time-series
 	B
 	C
 	D)
seven days
code:lisp
 (parallel
 	B
 	C
 	D)
I don't know if it is.

And the relationship with A.
code:lisp
 (define A (list
 	B
 	C
 	D))
seven days
code:lisp
 (has-children A (list
 	B
 	C
 	D))
I don't know if it is.

Conversely, this is similar to the KJ method, which expresses a relationship somehow by "putting them close together".
　The same indentation makes you think, "I don't know if this is a chronological list or an unordered list, but it must be some kind of a grouping.
　Parental hierarchy becomes "I wonder if it's some kind of higher concept".
　　Sometimes it's a tree-board style "child refers to parent" relationship.
　　　Here's a case study

Can be expressed in a more flexible way compared to writing sentences out of the blue.
　That's why there are so many people who use an outliner to write bullet points and then a writing style.
　　At least until just a few years ago, the KJ method didn't have enough screen resolution to do it digitally.

Even with bullet points, there is a need to "describe the relationship between distant objects" as described in [Why lines are essential].
　[Isn't it strange that Scrapbox's in-page links aren't easy to use?"]
