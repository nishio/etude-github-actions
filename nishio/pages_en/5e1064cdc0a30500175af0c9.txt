 It's right up my alley.

Next time 2/15, I may be able to take both levels at the same time.

Decide which grade to take
	I'm feeling unsure about level 2, but I scored 92, so I'm not sure if I'll take level 2 or 3.
	I failed to read that there was listening.
	　Listening for the first level is no good.
	　Only the reading is growing first, so we need to focus on developing the listening.
	Official HSK App
	　You can test yourself by listening to the words and answering the meaning.

You should solve past listening questions.
	I'll try the reading comprehension questions for level 3, probably over the passing grade.
	Then you can see that "it is the listening that needs to be trained."

　Unfortunately, you can't "retest only the questions you got wrong".
　　Retest "a set of 10 questions including the wrong question."
　　In the upper grades, every set is wrong, so they don't compress.
　　I can only listen to the wrong questions.
　　I can't distinguish between reading wrong and hearing wrong.
　　　It's different...

　　Looks like I'll have to pay more than $3,000 to solve the other problems.
