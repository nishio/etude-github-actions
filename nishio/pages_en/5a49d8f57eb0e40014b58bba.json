Oh, I guess I had to write "people who do only one thing" instead of "people who do only one thing," or it wouldn't have been a tendon.

In the words of the first Matz, writing code is [metaphorically] called "getting your feet on the ground.
I don't think it's enough if you have your feet on the ground; having only one specialty is just as unstable as standing on one leg. I believe that you should be [standing on two legs], with feet in multiple areas.
