	Document] [Observation] [Document] [Observation] [Observation] [Document] [Observation] [Observation] [Document
 The document is a location, and the observation vector is created by the observations at that location.
 	One specific example of an observation is the appearance of the word
		One specific example of a location is the document ID
 [Inverted index]
		Mapping observations to locations
 	Change the observation being generated from a location to a function that generates a location from an observation in the opposite direction.
  Feel like making [$ P(X|Y)] from [$ P(Y|X)] see [Bayes' Theorem].
 A function that returns a location for some input is [pointing
 Document ID is discrete
