An example of miscommunication
[https://gyazo.com/be038a553b824a19f7b0ef493d06baae]
 Mr. A believes a white circle exists.
 So when I see a "white circle with black circle", I interpret it as "with the intention to put a black circle".
 Say "stop" (orange arrow) in opposition to this intention.
 Mr. B believes there is no "white circle without black circle".
 Therefore, "stop" is interpreted as "denial of the white circle itself" (X in the white circle).
　I disagree because I consider this a bad idea (green arrow).
　This opinion appears to Mr. A to be "intent to put a black circle" in "white circle with black circle".
