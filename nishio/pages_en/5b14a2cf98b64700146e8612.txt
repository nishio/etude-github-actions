Vectorization of states
A [state] is often thought of as an element ([symbol]) of a set of [discrete].
Consider extending this to [vector space].

In that case the transition probability is a function of the vector to vector probability distribution
	very
 Represented by several representative points in k-means fashion

Note on synthesis method
 superscription
 	[$ v \leftarrow v_{new}]
 conversion
 	[$ v \leftarrow A v_{now}]
 synthetic
 	[$ v \leftarrow v_{new} + A v_{now}]
  Override when A=0
  When vnew=0, conversion

I want the matrices and state vectors to be acquired by learning.

 ã€€Move to the second nearest representative point
  Make negative examples training data.
 	(2019 addendum)
  	The idea is to keep representative points even after the state is embedded in the vector space
  	A representative point is just "a set of things that humans were able to verbalize in the first stage, saying, 'This is the kind of state of affairs that exists.
  	If you want to discretize it after vectorization, you could [Voronoi partition] at the first representative point, but you could also [k-means] on the new distribution
 Positive response
 	Is direct action the only positive example?
  Elicit that action as soon as possible.
