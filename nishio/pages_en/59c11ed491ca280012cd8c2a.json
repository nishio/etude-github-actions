Management Games
A game with a management motif.
Even in games that do not, many games have an analogy with management because of the optimal allocation of resources.

When programmers think about the process of learning programming, there is a large element of "[learning from practice]".
I think it is important to "learn from practice" in other areas as well.
However, the cost of actually running a company is high, and the damage when it fails is also high.
 If the damage of failure is too great, they will try to avoid it.
 It does the opposite of [increasing the risk of failure for the sake of knowledge acquisition].
It is good to fail a lot in games.
