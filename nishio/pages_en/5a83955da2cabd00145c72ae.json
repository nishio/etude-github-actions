 If you exceed the median of the amount of knowledge, you are "more knowledgeable than the majority".
 Too much knowledge saturates utility.
 	Why?
  	When utility is generated by the transfer of knowledge
   	Because the ability of the recipient of knowledge is the bottleneck.
    The further away from the majority, the higher the relocation costs.
