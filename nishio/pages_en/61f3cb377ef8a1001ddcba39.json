Think things through, and most importantly, think well.
I'm not sure about this one.

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Think things through, and most importantly, think well.
xxv 

All fools are grieved because they lack thought. They do not see half of things, they do not observe their own gain and loss, and therefore they do not devote themselves to them even more. Some weigh with a measure that is always wrong, making more of what is of little import and less of what is much. Many do not lose common sense because they have nothing to lose. There are matters that should be observed most carefully in the mind and then kept at their deepest level. The wise man thinks everything through, but he thinks most deeply where there is some deep difficulty, and thinks that perhaps there is more to it than he thinks. Thus his understanding expands as much as he understands.
