Stupid is good, but lying is not.
Cybozu's [fair and square] soft separate expression

I recently saw the expression, "It's okay to be an asshole, but not to lie, and it's everyone's responsibility to correct the asshole," and I thought this was taking it a step further.
If it's his responsibility to correct the asshole, he'll have an incentive to hide it and try to solve it alone.
But if it's everyone's responsibility, it's easier to share information promptly and solve the problem with everyone's help.
