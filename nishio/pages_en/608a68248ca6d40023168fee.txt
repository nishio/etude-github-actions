>[kazushi_takagi https://twitter.com/kazushi_takagi/status/1387361650248863744]: I have been hearing the term "job type" a lot lately and thought about it in relation to Cybozu's corporate structure and personnel system.

On the other hand, in a membership-based system, the person is decided first, so the person is transferred to a different post.

This is the liberalization of the internal labor market. The market principle works within the company by liberalizing transfers based on the will of individuals. [The transfer between teams is up to the individual.]
