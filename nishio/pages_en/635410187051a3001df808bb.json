Diary 2022-10-23

The fact that yesterday's diary page was not created reveals that you did not access this Scrapbox yesterday.

I woke up in the morning and went straight out for a walk, worked on another matter, had a meeting with the Unexplored Juniors, and wrote the minutes in Scrapbox.
I see, I didn't have access to this place.


I read 30 episodes of ENNEAD that came on some ad.
　The story of the feud between Set and Horus in Egyptian mythology
　I thought it was funny, and then episode 30 started the BL between Set and Horus.
　I didn't think it was BL at all.

　　Look closely, yourself. It says three places.
　It's like registering and buying and reading a membership from episode 31.
　　I wonder if they expect me to buy it with a "Gee, I wonder what's going to happen?"
　I wonder why it was advertised, maybe the Egyptian connection.
　　The ad AI says, "Whoa, this person has read 30 episodes of BL, I see you like BL! I'll advertise for you again!" I'll advertise again!
　>ENNEAD exists in R19 (equivalent to R18 in Japan) and R15 versions, but the R15 version is not distributed in Japan.
