_pickle.UnpicklingError: invalid load key, 'v'
>If git lfs is not included, the clone of the pre-trained model will get pointer information instead of entities, so when I run the code, I get something like _pickle.UnpicklingError: invalid load key, 'v'. I was hooked for a while when I ran the code.

In the [Textual Inversion] environment build, I copied and placed a model file with 4 gigs of [Stable Diffusion], but it probably references another model from within this model, which I cannot find, causing this error.

$ apt-get install git-lfs
$ git lfs install
$ git lfs pull
