(3.1.1) Hippocampus
The part called the [hippocampus] in [brain] is thought to play a very important role in memory.

The brain is wrapped in a "skin" of about 4 mm thick gray (*3) which is called [cerebral cortex]. Humans have a very developed cerebral cortex. The large cerebral cortex is folded, in order to pack it in limited volume. The end of this cerebral cortex is the hippocampus which is rounded. It is cylindrical like a rounded end of the towel and runs in the anterior-posterior direction of the brain.

FIg: The part where the end of the cerebral cortex rounded up was the hippocampus

	Footnote *3:  It is customarily called "gray" compared to the white part other than the cortex, but it is actually pink.
