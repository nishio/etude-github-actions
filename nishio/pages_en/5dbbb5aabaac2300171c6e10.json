An interesting case study of a link in a slide using Scrapbox notation.
	I wrote the link in Scrapbox notation in the slide (see Scrapbox for details, with the intention of)
	I put the presentation materials in Scrapbox.

	I searched for "associative" as appropriate in the demo that said "you can search across slides."

	What's that?" What is this `[stock of associations]` link? I just imported the slides."

	The link was written in Scrapbox notation on the slide itself.
	Automatically pasted the OCR result and it worked as a Scrapbox link
