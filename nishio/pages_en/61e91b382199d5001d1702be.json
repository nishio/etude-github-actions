(Column) 7 Habits
[Stephen Richards Covey] introduced [The 7 Habits] of supporting growth process. He thinks there are two processes of growth:

	"private success" which changes from a dependent state to an independent state
	"public success" which changes from an independent state to an interdependent state

Each process supported by three habits.

	Supporting private success
		❶ Have [autonomy]
		❷ Begin with [purpose]
		❸ [Prioritize important matters]
	Supporting Public Success
		❹ [Win-Win] or no deal
		❺ First you [understand others] then others understand you
		❻ show [synergistic] effect

The seventh habit is "sharpen blades" that support the whole.
