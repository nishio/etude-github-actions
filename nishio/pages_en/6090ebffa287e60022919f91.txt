 *1242439849* Going to Desertfest
 <a href='http://www.designfesta.com/index.html'>Art Event Design Festa [Tokyo Big Sight]</a>.
 
 I should just take the Yurikamome Line from Shimbashi and get off at Tenjijo-mae Station. I remembered, I'll leave my PC at the front station because it's too heavy.

 There have been "several times per second" accesses for quite a long time, but it seems to be coming to an end.

 Seems like only a small amount of time that one CPU wasn't enough to handle the load.
 
 It can withstand a daily load of up to 10 times this amount without charge. I guess the frequent timeouts that occurred when I created the most limited online program in the past was just a bad way to do it. If you need more, you can buy it at "CPU Time $0.10/CPU hour". I put AdSense on the site to test it out, but as long as the CPU time consumed per PV is below a certain level, it doesn't matter how many people are on the site, just use the AdSense income to buy CPU time.

 After posting on my phone, I came back and added the URL from the pamplet, etc.

 Interesting.
 
 
 PS: <a href='http://evafunderburgh.com/'>Eva Funderburgh</a> The creatures are made of pottery. The texture is very interesting, like a smooth surface.
 
 
 There was an exhibition and sale of polymer clay buttons. I think I'll exhibit my old ones, too.
 
 
 PS: Natural stones, even transparent ones, will not allow light to pass through if metal is attached to the back of the stone. On the other hand, if you drill holes directly into the stone, especially small stones, they are prone to breakage. The solution of "encasing the stone in thin plastic" is an interesting one. http://www.shoon.info/
 
 
 I found a resin sealed one almost as is. When I made it, I didn't like the burrs that appeared, so I stopped making it, but I saw it on the shelf as a product with the burrs still on it. And it sold right in front of my eyes. I wonder if my standards are just too high.
 
 
 PS: <a href='http://www16.ocn.ne.jp/~tstoraya/'>Hand-painted T-shirt Toraya p01</a>. The handwriting was done right in front of my eyes.
 
 
 Addendum: <a href='http://serendipity-glass.com/'>Serendipity Top</a>. I was processing glass and solder to make accessories. I had not thought of gold plating on solder, but surely there is nothing wrong if it can be gold plated. It would be easier to handle than processing gold directly, and I'm afraid of the lead in solder alone, but I wonder if it would be safe if it were plated.
 
 
 There was another resin seal. I knew that I should first disclose it to the public, instead of judging whether it was done well or not and sealing it up.
 
 
 There are people playing mahjong (laughs).
 
 
 There was a glass work that I was very attracted to. I was wondering whether I should buy the T-shirt with a picture of JK-FF circuit for 3,000 yen, and while I was holding off and looking around, I found a glass work I was interested in for 3,000 yen, so I decided to buy this one if it was the same 3,000 yen. I decided to buy this one for the same 3,000 yen. Because I can make T-shirts by myself if I really want to, but it's not so easy to make glass works. PS: <a href='http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~tyama/'>Glass Studio HIKARI factory: Making and selling glass accessories using Pyrex, including inside-out pendants. </a>
 
 
 I see a lot of felted stuffed animals. Maybe it's because the book was published. The penguins and other stuffed animals are very nice. I want to make one too.
 
 
 I imagine, but it looks difficult to wash.
 
 
 I wondered why they were doing something like a fashion show, but I guess the philosophy is that there are no barriers to creativity. I see.
 
 
 The glass works that surprised me were sold at other places as well. The shape is difficult to make due to the expansion rate, but the explanation there solved the mystery. It seems that heat-resistant glass is melted and used. The reason it is heat-resistant is that it does not break easily due to thermal expansion, but I had never thought of melting heat-resistant glass and using it for glasswork. I was impressed!
 
 
 PS: <a href='http://tentosen.moo.jp/'>tentosen</a> The repeating pattern is interesting.
 
 
 I was so surprised that I wondered what it was, and then I saw that he was doing magic!
 
 
 Looks like it can be turned on.
 
 
 I'm doing Mario.
 
 
 PS: <a href='http://oxoxo.me/'>oxoxo [zero by zero]</a> smoke and water art. Interesting.
 
 
 The heat from the power supply alone turns the Stirling engine, and the plastic's whirling properties are shown by the polarizer. Cool.
 
 
 I came back. It was interesting. I wanted to make something and exhibit it.
 
 
 I'll try to reconstruct the timeline as best I can from the documents and other materials I've received. I added a lot of stuff. Surprisingly many people do not have web pages. I found some interesting things, but it is hard to introduce them without a web page. On the other hand, there were some people who were just looking at something that caught their attention, but were immediately given a card with the URL on it, and when they came back they said, "What is this? What's this?" I looked at the page and remembered some of the things. I introduced them to you because I was so curious. I think it is natural to have web pages for oneself and one's works, but it seems that the world has not yet reached a state where people take it for granted. There is a big difference in temperature from the web world.

 Interesting. I'll read the original one too and translate what I find interesting.

 *** Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
 
 Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. In other words, if you've put your wits about you to write the code, you're not smart enough to debug it (as is clear from the definition). - Brian Kernighan
 
 
 *** Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
 
 Measuring progress in programming by the number of lines is like measuring progress in building an airplane by its weight. --- Bill Gates

 Write your code like this: as if the maintainer of your code is a violent psychopath and also knows where you live. - Rick Osborne

 *1242490800* Something's not right.
 I haven't written a single line of code today because Kernel Panic killed the whole Emacs I was working on. I don't think the engine will start now, so I'm going to bed.
 
 To be done tomorrow or so: /game implementation

 <body>I know it's not a simple comparison, but resin kits without individual garage kit figures are miserable. <br>These are just a few examples. <br>But the finished exhibits are amazing. <br>That's why I want to make it available to the public</body>.

 <body>Oh, you mean the three-dimensional modeling where resin is poured into a mold to harden, right? I judged from the mention of "yuguchi". <BR><BR>What I saw at Desigfest was<BR>http://fujiko1117.blog43.fc2.com/blog-entry-43.html<BR>like the large square one in the foreground of this photo, it was made by pouring resin into a square container after various encapsulated castings were placed in it and then pouring the resin into it to solidify it. This is a square container. When this is done, the surface tension of the container and the surface of the liquid causes sharp edges, so there is a lot of burr and it does not feel good to the touch. When I made it, I tried to remove the burrs with a file, but it was too hard, and the edges turned white, so I gave up on it. I don't know where it went...</body>.

 <body>I apologize for the misunderstanding. <BR>It's a little late for this, but as you say, transparent resin will turn white when filed, but if you file it finer and finer and polish it with compound at the end, it will become quite beautiful and transparent. It takes a lot of time and effort. </body> </P> </P> <BODY>

 <body>Yes, that's right> it turns cloudy white<br>I went so far as to buy some compound and try it out, but it was too much of a hassle and here's the short version</body>.
