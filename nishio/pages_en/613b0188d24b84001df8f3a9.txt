　Kei strives to ask the right questions for the right keywords, but sometimes it makes mistakes. In such cases, there is a function that tells Kei that the question is not good enough.
　　The NGKW button tells you "Don't dig for this keyword.
　　　It is a pretty strong imperative. The keyword will almost never be selected.
　　　Assumed use case is when "w" in "seriously w" is selected as a keyword, and the "w" is removed from the candidate.
　　　If you use this a lot early in the conversation, you will not be able to talk your way out of it.
　　The UPKW button tells you, "Dig deeper here than those keywords.
　　The NG button conveys a dissatisfied look to the program.
　　　This is an emotional expression of "that's not a good question.
　　　Even statements like "ummm..." are judged in the same way using machine learning.
　　　This only inserts pictograms into the text field, but does not send them. You can also write additional messages.
　　　I imagine it's something like, "I'll answer you with a disgruntled look on my face."
　　The adjacent smiley face mark has no particular function.
　　　I put it on because it is unbalanced to be able to make a disgruntled face and not be able to smile.

[* phase mode].
　If you have a lot to talk about and want people to listen without asking questions first, type "listen first" and the program will go into phase mode.
　In the phase mode, you do not ask questions, you just phase.
　When you finish speaking, type "end" and the dialogue will begin with the input up to that point remembered.

[* heartbeat]
　If you have something you don't want to enter into the program but would like to log, start with an opening parenthesis to "speak your mind"!
