230 Street.
	It doesn't say "keep the change," so the interpretation is that it's okay to keep the change.
 You can pay 230 ways from 1 yen to 230 yen.

71st Street.
	It says "use it," so the interpretation is that there should be no unused coins + change can be given out.
	100+50+10 from 160 to 230 in 71 ways

24 ways (common mistake)
	The idea that it's a product of two, three, or four ways.
 It distinguishes between "paying 100 yen with one 100 yen piece" and "paying 50 yen with two 50 yen pieces".
 However, since the question phrase is "how many ways to pay" and not "how many amounts", multiple ways to pay with the same amount must be considered identical.
 So I guess you can't count "how you pay" when you specify "amount" as the quintessential "amount".
 In addition, if we accept the interpretation that "it is acceptable to distinguish payment methods," there are more than 230 ways to do so (because it is distinguishable whether one yen is paid in 100-yen coins, 50-yen coins, or 10-yen coins).

19th street
	There are 4 possible values mod by 50 (0, 10, 20, 30) and 5 possible quotients divided by 50 (0-4), but the combination (0, 0) is 4 * 5 - 1 because it cannot be paid since it is 0 yen.
 Perhaps the intent of the question.

Six ways.
	Interpretation that there should be no unused coins because it says "spend" + change should not be given out.

one way
	The condition "use three 10-yen coins" is interpreted as not permitting "use only two of the three 10-yen coins.
 Only one street of $230 is payable.
