When you're talking with a work screen out or explaining a presentation material out instead of talking face to face, it's hard to notice what's going on with the person listening.
While audio is the main way to get the listener to notice, these annotations function as a separate channel to be noticed by writing on the screen.
You may leave it ON for now.
