 *1260028536*70 km/h quiz
 Mr. A is on a train traveling at 50 km/h. If this train is not running at 50 km/h, he will be late for his date. Oh, if this train were traveling at 70 km/h, I would be on time!
 
 With this in mind, Mr. A came up with the idea of moving at a speed of 70 km/h. When he did this, Mr. A was indeed traveling at a speed of 70 km/h. If you do this, you will indeed be able to travel at 70 km/h. Now what is it? Now what is it?

 <body>Get off at the next stop and transfer, run forward at 20km/h, call her and have her walk to the intermediate station at 10km/h + I move forward at 10km/h (her position is the origin) I can come up with something silly like that, but what if pulse jamming the train inverter is the right way to go? What if the train's inverter is pulse-jamming? </body>
