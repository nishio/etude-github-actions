　　In the future, I think it would be good to use Github Action to spit out a static file and host it on Github Pages or something, but in the beginning it will be trial and error to see how it looks, so even if you spit it out statically, it will all be spit out again.

　　Is there anything to bump into?
　Then merge the machine translation of this project into English
　　I think this is a definite clash, we need a trial and error method of resolving the clash.

　　Maybe we can lay it out in Kozaneba?
　　　Only if the user has a wide screen.
　　You could also add a [ScrapboxSRS]-type thing.
