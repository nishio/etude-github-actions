>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468453313746452485]: well, I'm starting to feel that lines are "very useful" or even "essential". I'm on the verge of adding "[having lines]" to the list of advantages of digital KJ method tools over paper.
>(It's no longer quite the same as the original KJ method.)

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468454613347364866]: [why lines are essential]. Without lines, stickies can only have the relationship of proximity. Since stickies can only have one place, an element of hierarchical classification emerges, albeit without clear boundaries. The equivalent of the "which should I put it in?" question in the [bat problem] arises: "Which should I put it in?

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468455136519667712]: this is the driving force when finding structure in something that has no structure at all yet, "I can only put it one way or the other, so I'm going to put it in eia" and "I'm going to put it down and then think of a reason for having put it down". This is the driving force of "thinking about the reason for placing it after placing it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468455841154334720]: but this constraint gets in the way when it comes to things like "reading a book and understanding it". Because books are already structured by the author. You swallow it whole without distorting it first for understanding, but then [the existing structure] gets in there and there is no room for additional structure.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468584540365258755]: I'm rereading the Relevance section I didn't understand the most.
>I think a should be translated because the original sentence is "relationships between a X and one or more Y of it"!
>I read the back of the book and then came back to it so I could understand it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468590966605254657]: hmmm, it doesn't look like understandable means able to comprehend after all,
>relevant felt meanings, from out of which symbolization is understandable
> So.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468600224432390156]: hmmm, but in the summary table it's given felt meaning, so the direction of the arrow is correct, and the original commentary text here is just a mess?

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468603334739509248]: In the first place, since comprehension is explicitly described as a non-parallel meaning-making process, we should not assume that it includes merely symbolizing or felting symbols. Therefore, we should not assume that it includes merely symbolizing or making symbols into felt meanings.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468605886642147333]: I translated "comprehension" as "comprehension" and it clashed with "understand". It means "to find an appropriate word for something that has not been put into words and has been unclear, and to become "this! It does not include, for example, reading a book and understanding it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468629888181874688]: I was eating ice cream after taking a bath when I suddenly had an epiphany: "Yes, it's Merleau-Ponty" (unintelligible).

(See Merleau-Ponty's section in the appendix.)

The organization of RELEVANCE has not been completed on Kozaneba, but has entered the phase of [one-dimensionalization] of the presentation material, due to the fixed time of the [Study Group 1 on "Creation of Experience Process and Meaning"].
　[Deadline Driven].
 　Without deadlines, we'd be structuring in a space with a lot of freedom all the time.
 　[Without a deadline, you run toward a very distant goal that you will never reach.]

I'm feeling a little uncomfortable now that things have come to a close.
I guess I'll just call it done, since we're not going to make any progress if we keep cheating.

I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm done with the presentation material.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468948209087447041]: I'm googling Heidegger's dwell-think concept, because I think it might be relevant to what I want to think about, but I'm having trouble with all the hits about architecture and such. I'm having trouble with it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468949029694603264]: at least we know it's "Bauen Wohnen Denken"

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468952505682128898]: I finally figured out when it was made on Wikipedia in English. I wonder if a Japanese translation is available - I haven't found one so far.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468955115659067392]: it was in this one, which apparently means it's too short to be a stand-alone book

End of announcement

Transcribe presentation materials back to Kozaneba for further organization
	[https://gyazo.com/99703ce239503123ca2c68ce35053721]
	Hey, this is the release version of Kozaneba, I think you didn't deploy the line edge shifting bug that you fixed before.

The nuances of the "full understanding" stamp didn't come across and need improvement.
a branch
https://scrapbox.io/nishio/ダニング and the Krueger effect
I think I have a full understanding, and then I "output something that has not been output before," and then the verification of understanding takes place, so I am full of confidence at this point in time.


To what we refer to by the word metaphor.
A: "How to use the new symbols."
B: "Create new ways to use symbols."
C: "The reader reads the use of new symbols and perceives new meanings."
D: A form of communication that does B and does C
Although the shaking of the
B is COMPREHENSION and C is METAPHOR
One example of ABC is the so-called "metaphor" as a general term.
D is an example in the process of explaining METAPHOR, but it caused this entire diagram to be headed METAPHOR, which is confusing

After I finished, I received a reference book w
Challenges in Phenomenology https://scrapbox.io/nishio/現象学の課題

The field of psychotherapy, because of pragmatism in its definition of correctness, tends to focus on what's of practical benefit.

If you're using the "full understanding" stamp literally to mean "full understanding", you could have written "full understanding" in text, so the fact that you didn't bother to do so and put up an image of the stamp suggests a "non-parallel use of the symbol", but it's too high context. (understanding requires RELEVANCE experience to be the context) and didn't get the message.
	(This framework is useful, it clearly explains many phenomena. (So you mean you have articulated about this field))
	I'd write on the stamp, "This is an example of non-parallel symbol usage and does not literally mean 'fully understood.'"

>Coming up with metaphors is "understanding. (p.144)
I'm pointing out that the translation is a source of confusion, but quoting from the Japanese translation was a bad idea, you should pull from the original.
>To invent a metaphor to express a prior felt meaning is "comprehension." (p.117)

I'm talking about what the "m" is, it's always been "F" for FELT MEANING up to that point, but only here it's "m".
F to match the notation of the other figures.

I guess I should have emphasized more the separation of "one FM" and "the other FM."
　[https://gyazo.com/72c5dfaa9c9747d4af30f65b1d7cd0ba]
　In the previous version, I drew "somewhat more than one" in the bottom two, but I drew only one other, because what is essentially important is that it is "not one" and "other".
　FR is given, FG is now modified and created, that is the difference in the horizontal axis

make understandable
Not COMPREHENSION.

I'm all done, but I need to deploy the bug where the end of the line is misaligned and then take a screenshot.
