Creating Resource Packs in Minecraft JE1.17
[https://gyazo.com/ce90a54c8ec00d03eb7769caf37d3428]

summary
　Changing the texture of an existing model is easy.
　　I just need to change the image.
　Easy to change the design of armor and other items.
　　You can only change the texture of the model.
　　So the same difficulty as changing textures.
　　Using [Blockbench] is recommended
　　　You can choose Armor or something else from the New Minecraft Skin and paint it while looking at the 3D shape.

　Difficult to change the shape of the block, complicated by various specifications
　　If you want something that is not a hit-and-miss item, you can make it as a hand-held item and put it in a frame.
　　All of the custom examples below are framed items (the framed models are reduced to 1/4 the size of the framed models).

I don't know, I read the

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp5iCZxEmt4]
I figured it out when I saw this.
First, go to [https://minecraft.fandom.com/ja/wiki/.minecraft .minecraft - Minecraft Wiki] to locate the Mycla file
	`Mac OS X	~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`
　Then zip and extract the jar in minecraft/versions
　There are various files in ASSETS.

Let's take a look inside.
code:assets/minecraft/blockstates/blue_terracotta.json
 {
   "variants": {
     "": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/blue_terracotta"
     }
   }
 }

code:assets/minecraft/models/block/blue_terracotta.json
	{
   "parent": "minecraft:block/cube_all",
   "textures": {
     "all": "minecraft:block/blue_terracotta"
   }
 }
That is, the shape is a cube with the same texture on all sides, and the texture is `block/blue_terracotta`.

By the way, I realized after I got here that `blue_terracotta` is the monochromatic one, and I was looking for `blue_glazed_terracotta`.

　Let's replace this with another image

Once again, I remembered that what I am about to make is yellow, so look at `yellow_glazed_terracotta`.
code:assets/minecraft/blockstates/yellow_glazed_terracotta.json
 {
   "variants": {
     "facing=east": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta",
       "y": 270
     },
     "facing=north": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta",
       "y": 180
     },
     "facing=south": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta"
     },
     "facing=west": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta",
       "y": 90
     }
   }
 }
This is a command to rotate the displayed model around the Y axis according to the block orientation information.

So, the model goes like this
code:assets/minecraft/models/block/yellow_glazed_terracotta.json
 {
   "parent": "minecraft:block/template_glazed_terracotta",
   "textures": {
     "pattern": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta"
   }
 }

`assets/minecraft/textures/block/yellow_glazed_terracotta.png`
Bottom line, we should be able to replace this image.

Just put the files to be replaced under .minecraft/resourcepacks in the same directory structure as this asset.

Put in the resource pack you made.

It's done.

You can either replace X.png directly or put a new file and rewrite the reference from block/X.json
　Then the model of the item you have would be a rewritten one.

   "parent": "minecraft:block/template_glazed_terracotta",

	{
   "variants": {
     "facing=east": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta",
       "y": 270
     },
     "facing=north": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta",
       "y": 180
     },
     "facing=south": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta"
     },
     "facing=west": {
       "model": "minecraft:block/yellow_glazed_terracotta",
       "y": 90
     }
   }
 }


Then put this on the server so that it will be applied without the participant having to configure the resource pack
	[server resource pack trial and error log].

Right now I'm running the following shell script on my end (Mac)
code:resourcepacks/cybozu/build.sh
 zip -r ../cybozu.zip .
 shasum ../cybozu.zip
 mv ../cybozu.zip ~/Dropbox
Write the displayed hash value in server.properties and restart the server.
The server configuration looks like this
code:server.properties
 resource-pack=https\://www.dropbox.com/.../cybozu.zip?dl\=1
	require-resource-pack=true
	resource-pack-sha1=...

Client is asked to accept the server resource pack after logging in again
　I thought it would be downloaded if I accepted and proceeded, but it won't, why?
　It will be downloaded the next time you connect to it.
