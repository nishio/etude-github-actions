I found that Google is telling me "This browser is not secure and will not let you log in" in a Cypress environment, this is... what should I do...

This is what happens when you can log in

I thought it would be easy to do, but I ran into an error with little information.

Maybe it would be better to configure Local Emulator Suite and do the authentication on a local server

 === Project Setup
 
 First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
 You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
 but for now we'll just set up a default project.

 Error: Failed to list Firebase projects. See firebase-debug.log for more info.

They say the old version of the login information fails, so you should log in again.
$ firebase logout
$ firebase login
OK, done.

It's not an anonymous login, but it's showing up as anonymous because there's no displayName.

Users can be configured on the emulator side

There is a syntax error in the official sample, though.
I wrote a configuration file and installed Java and it worked.

Firestore is running locally, so I can always delete the whole thing without regret, and I'll try to save it in a mess.
	I mean, if you can't delete everything from the test code, the test will behave differently, as it should.
	There was there, there was there
	 > The Firestore production environment does not provide a platform SDK method for flushing the database, but the Firestore emulator provides a REST endpoint for this purpose.

>you should be using the useEmulator() after the firestore.settings({ experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling: true }). 

code:ts
 const db = firebase.firestore();
 // NG
 db.useEmulator("localhost", 8080); 
 db.settings({ experimentalForceLongPolling: true });
 // OK
 db.settings({ experimentalForceLongPolling: true });
 db.useEmulator("localhost", 8080);

it works!

　ExperimentalForceLongPolling must be set to true
　You need to do this before you useEmulator.
