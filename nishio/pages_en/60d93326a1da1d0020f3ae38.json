Is machine learning a swing back to the equipment industry?
>[tkgshn https://twitter.com/tkgshn/status/1408748204632330241]: Hmmm, is there a theory that machine learning is becoming the default, and (assuming that the notion of productive capacity is becoming software by default) that the competitiveness of companies is swinging back to a layer of capital, rather than knowledge workers? I'm not talking about the knowledge worker, but is there a theory that it is swinging back to the capital layer?

>[tkgshn https://twitter.com/tkgshn/status/1408748334664151041]: isn't this the kind of structure you're referring to in "[post-capitalist society]"? Has it already overtaken it? That's what I meant in my tweet.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1408749996904652801]: Yes, there is. Machine learning seems to be a [device industry] of huge capital. Drucker is not an esper, so he could not have foreseen this.

>[tkgshn https://twitter.com/tkgshn/status/1408750892451389446]: I guess - I was trying to make do with my knowledge until now, but I feel like I've been shaking things back up with all the ML spinning and brute force, you know..,

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1408753182113636361]: like the [spiral staircase], we're not back where we started, we're one step up. In the past, Google researchers would not have been able to publish papers, nor would they have been able to publish their learned models. Once the world went through a talent market dominated by knowledge workers, the equilibrium point moved because "if you prohibit the publication of results, you can't hire the best researchers".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1408757469908668422]: maybe this is because information science is a cross-disciplinary discipline. In the past, the knowledge produced by corporate laboratories was tightly coupled to the business, and disclosing it would only be a foolish act that would benefit competitors. Nowadays, information disclosure is a public interest action because it provides benefits far and wide outside the business domain.
