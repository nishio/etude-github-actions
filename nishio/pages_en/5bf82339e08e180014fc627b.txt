Dispersion and Repetition
[https://gyazo.com/5fd16cd0d11eb3b7bc5357d8178b01ef]
The best outcomes for a person with an ability of mean 0 standard deviation 1 and a person with an ability of mean 0 standard deviation 2, each with 100 challenges, are different as shown in the figure.
The means of the respective distributions are 2.5 and 5.0; the standard deviations are 0.43 and 0.85. This happens because the variance is reduced by the effect of [selection], which selects the best, while the variance is expanded when simply adding them together.
