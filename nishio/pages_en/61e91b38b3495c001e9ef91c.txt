(1.1.1) Information gathering
[Information gathering] is similar to the task of gathering and arranging many boxes. However, regardless of how much information you gather, the [boxes] accumulate on the [floor] and do not [stack] up.

Here I use the [metaphor] of [box] to describe a unit of information.
