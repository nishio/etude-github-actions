I have been trying [Incremental Reading] for a while and now "Aha! happened, so I'll make a note of it.

first (of all)

When I read the expression "creative review and elaboration" in the "Elaboration" section, I didn't feel the meaning very strongly when I read it normally.

In the early days, it was called [Elaborative IR] in
http://wiki.supermemo.org/index.phpâ€¦
After reading this far, it still didn't ring a bell.

Look up Elaborate in the dictionary just to be sure.
>elaborate [automatic] [carefully] state in detail.
Still at this point.

And when I came back to the first "creative review and elaboration," for the first time I thought, "Well!" I thought. This is more about elaboration. I read back the fragments and elaborate the explanations incrementally.

I wasn't quite sure what it meant when I first called it.
>In addition, one's own writing may be the source of most input, as opposed to external electronic sources. 
I think that makes sense, too. With Incremental Reading, I mainly read information that comes from the outside, but with [Incremental Writing], I spend more time reading my own writing because I mainly "review and elaborate".
