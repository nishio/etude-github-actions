Functional, not part-wise" could be MVP.
from [/unnamedcamp/ "functional, not component-like" may be MVP].
[not "write in parts"].
	>If you describe writing [atomic] as "writing in parts", the image is somewhat off. It seems to me that it cannot accomplish anything on its own. Rather, "let's write it functionally" is closer to "let's write it functionally.
　[/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon]I think it would be beneficial to delve into what is uncomfortable about "component-like" and why "functional" would feel right.
 　Basic premise: Both "component-like" and "functional" are metaphors here, so don't break [reverse Jenga] by saying "that's not what I feel the word means". These are "[metaphors are] hooks for catching fish.
 　Partial = nothing can be done alone
 		That is, functional = can do something on its own.
 	Isn't that what this is?

　　The idea is to create something that can stand alone from the start, not to create pages that cannot stand alone and are parts of other things in advance.
