Give a reason not Just be conscious
	There was a reference to Give a reason in the comments in response to [the duplicate article https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m001358.html], but I felt it was more of a Just be conscious.
 Why Just be conscious instead of Give a reason?
 The lyrics are written by the same person, so from a distance they are very similar, but I'll try to verbalize why one of them feels different from the other.
 	(PS) but the lyrics were different to begin with.

   Just be conscious(J): [lyrics https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/254338/lyrics/I011247/] lyrics by MEGUMI

 >(G) There must be an "answer" somewhere.
 > We all want it, and we all go for the dream that we can't resist.
 This is where I first feel uncomfortable.
  The concept that the "born answer" is "somewhere" and you seek it assumes that the answer is somewhere far away that is not you. This is where it doesn't feel right.
	>(J) Each form of happiness is different, don't be fooled by what others say.
 >What I believe is my reality, I don't need patronizing hypocrisy.
	This one fits better. I agree with what follows, "Since we are living in the present, we should do what we like and what we enjoy," and I don't want others to decide that this "what we like and what we enjoy" is "going to our dreams in search of answers that are somewhere far away.

	On the side of Give a reason, I sense a desire to escape from oppression, anxiety about the possibility that my future self has not found the "answer," and a sense of frustration.
 	>(G) I wanted to try this power to struggle my way out.
  >(G) I don't want to be left with nothing to show for it.
  >(G) Give a reason for life to my future self
 I keep running in a state of urgency to find answers, and that's driven by other people's values.
		Trying to get out of oppression itself is already in the composition of oppression.

	Just be conscious is "feel a chance" while the way out of oppression is "keep running" in the case of Give a reason #Luck
		>I'm blocked in by oppression, blaming others won't change it, luck, chance, coincidence, and timing, sharpen my mind, and feel it.

 The notion that "I have to keep running" creates oppression and frustration.
 If you're running around in the dark in a hurry, you don't have time to sharpen your mind.
 Running around looking for "the answer somewhere else" won't help you find the answer, because the answer is inside you.
  #The Blue Bird of Maeterlinck
 Silence, tranquility, interludes, time to stop and [reflect] is needed.
  Music is the silence between sounds." #Music is the silence between sounds
	>(J) We can become stronger and kinder every time we know the hurt. The truth after the tears. Living in the irreplaceable now.
 > I want to like myself tomorrow, so I hug myself today.
 > It's a waste not to at least enjoy life (drama) in which you are the main character.
	It's not a good idea to whip yourself into running today.
	There's no drama that keeps the hero running all the time.
	The most important thing is that the protagonist enjoys performing.

	By the way, the title "Just be conscious" has a focus on "being aware" and "being aware".
 Lyrics about noticing are here.
 >(J) I'm going through the same pain over and over until I realize it's a labyrinth.
 And, by realizing it, you get out of it. So what do we do to get out of it?
 >(J) Listen carefully and find out that there is always a way out.
	The phrase "listen carefully" is a refrain from "sharpen your mind."
		>I'm blocked in by oppression, blaming others won't change it, luck, chance, coincidence, and timing, sharpen my mind, and feel it.
 This is where you should notice the most.

	Sharpen your mind and what follows when you sense an opportunity.
 	>Grab that dream in both hands, now, and take off your unnecessary pride.
  >(J) Run, don't look back, time is ticking prologue.
	The prologue is the introduction to the story. In other words, it is from there that the "life (drama) in which you are the main character" begins to gain momentum.
 Run after you find an opportunity, don't run from the beginning, "listen" first to find an opportunity.
