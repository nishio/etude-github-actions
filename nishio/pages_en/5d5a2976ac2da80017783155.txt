Weibo
	I thought I created a Weibo account before, but I can't log in.
		Did the account disappear because it was created and left unattended for a long period of time?
		I made a new one: https://weibo.com/u/7277520899
		I couldn't figure out how to log in from a PC, but the PC side gives out a QR code, which is then scanned by the app.

	Weibo Interesting
 	When you open the app, the first thing you see is a full-page ad.
 	I followed various accounts and got instant DMs.
 		There would be an automatic message back feature when following up.
 		They have it on line.
	 When you RT without a message, it will be clearly marked as "Repost".
