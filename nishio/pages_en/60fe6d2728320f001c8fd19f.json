Cluttered room, animal trail.
Recently, my wife and I have been trying to clean up our room, and I think that Scrapbox is a tool to put [animal paths] through [cluttered rooms].

I'm using the term "beast path" to mean [DESIRE PATH].

I think I saw a statement somewhere along the lines of "Scrapbox is a road through a garbage dump."
　I can't find it.

[who puts things back where they belong and where they can be seen].
[who wants to be seen and who wants to fit in]
　I'm the kind of person who doesn't know if I can't see it, so I prefer to "notice it by accidentally seeing it while I'm working on it".
　　Scrapbox does a fuzzy search when you're writing a link and creates "I just happen to see it".
　　　This fits me.
　　And "I wrote the link and it turned blue instead of red" also "just happened."
　　　It's like you're walking down the street at random and you come across a familiar place.
　My wife finds it "noisy" to have things strewn about where she can see them.
　　So if it's scattered where I can see it, I put it away in a box.
　　　That's because they perceive it as an improvement when they "put it away in a box".
　　　I, on the other hand, don't perceive it as an improvement.
　The main principle of tidying up the physical world is to "not have more than you can manage.
　　In other words, "throw away."
　　The room of a person who can't throw things away is overflowing with stuff and clutter.
　　Electronic ones, on the other hand, have no space limitations.
　　　If you save it all, you won't run out of living space.
　　　Limited resources are not "space".
　　　It's not always appropriate to bring in the metaphor of cleaning up physical space.
　　　　Probably not appropriate.
　　　　Very high weighting of "make searchable," etc.
