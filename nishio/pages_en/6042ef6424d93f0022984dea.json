soft reset
Initialize the game while taking over some information.
It is a kind of [strong new game].

In a cookie-cutter game, the decision to choose the one you think is better from multiple options is an element of the game, but it's a waste if you have multiple options and you only choose one and pass it by.
By creating achievements that you can only get if you choose a certain option, you'll have to do a soft reset to choose each option if you want to get all the achievements.
