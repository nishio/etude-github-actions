Sticky notes are immutable.
	Shouldn't [sticky object] be [immutable]?
	If stickies are used on more than one map, they can't be rewritten.
	There is only one real body of the sticky, which is referenced by the temporary bodies on each map.
		[Real/false body system]
	Only the temporary body has the coordinates of the stickies and the affiliation map.
	Content is updated by referencing the entity, and a new entity is created.

In other words, there should be a "Reuse" button instead of an "Edit" button in the sticky's detail view
