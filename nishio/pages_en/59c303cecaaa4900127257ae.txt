 	The "A beats B" relationship is not transitive.
  code::
   A = (0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4),
   B = (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3),
   C = (2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6),
   D = (1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5).
		Unlike the calculation of expected value, the calculation of "probability of winning" involves a nonlinear function that says "win small, lose big, win/lose once", which can be used to create a die with the same expected value but with a higher probability of winning.
 The probability of winning a gacha with probability 1/N drawn N times is rather low.
 In backgammon, throw two dice or throw one and go twice as far, and the latter will finish first.
 [deviation from the mean and sample size].
 	Low incidence in rural areas, but also high incidence in rural areas
	Uniform random numbers added together approach a normal distribution
  [/prog-exercises/generate normal distribution].
  The public doesn't seem to understand the "shape of the distribution," as evidenced by the "random number cock" response.
  How to experience it? â†’[A game to get a feel for the skin of stochastic events].
	Repeated seemingly equal transactions create a gap between the rich and the poor.
 	[not a natural occurrence of disparity].

 Random distributions do not look random.

  What humans naively imagine as a random distribution is more uniform than a truly random distribution
  Because what humans usually observe, such as the distribution of trees in the mountains, is not a truly random distribution, but a homogenized distribution due to the effect of "too close together and they exclude each other".
