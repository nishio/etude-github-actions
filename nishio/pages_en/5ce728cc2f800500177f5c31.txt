equality
>In Japan, the idea of equality is that people are not born with different abilities, so everyone should work hard and grow up to the [standard]. In the U.S., people are born with different abilities from the start, so equality means that each child can receive an education suited to his or her individual needs. If we don't change our way of thinking, we can't have [gifted education].
>>I see. I see that the "egalitarian" education that "there should be no difference in natural ability" attributes the difference in performance to "[effort]" and instead makes children [unreciprocal] and negative toward [redistributional policies].

[Does anti-competitive education reduce helping each other?　Fumio Otake's Training the Economic Brain Japan Center for Economic Research https://www.jcer.or.jp/column/otake/index666.html]
>The most extreme form of education that emphasizes cooperation rather than competition would be to not assign rankings to various grades. In Japan, there were elementary schools that did not include a race in athletic meets, or even if they did have a race, they did not assign a rank, or in extreme cases, they held hands and let everyone finish together. The results of Ito, Kubota and Ohtake's (2014) analysis are shocking. Those who received an anti-competitive education were less [altruistic], more negative toward cooperation, more likely to have a less reciprocal but more [get-back] value system, and more likely to be negative toward redistributive policies. Perhaps the exact opposite of what education was intended to achieve.
