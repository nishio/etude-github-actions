Isolate the methodology by the specific problem you want to solve.
Porting my past Facebook threads that I hit in the search to Scrapbox because they seem useful.

	Isolate the method by the specific problem you want to solve.
	[The KJ method is an idea method, so it responds to the need for ideas.
 	But "I want ideas" itself is pretty vague.
  	Many people don't even know what it is that they are looking for in the first place.
	The value of the KJ method for me is [expanding working memory].
 	The advantage is that with training, more than 100 pieces of information can be put into working memory when there is too much information and too much pain to handle at one time.
		Specifically, when you have a lot of content you want to include in a book or other manuscript, it is useful to structure it.
	The prerequisite for this is to get the information out of your head, which is the [written] method.
 	The issue this is trying to solve is forgetting what you were thinking about while you were thinking about it.
		Many people stumble at this writing.
  	Dealing with it
   	There are various [frameworks] that you can create and then trigger questions.
   	Brainstorming] and [World Café] are [triggers] for other people's ideas.
    Moving your body to trigger a change in perspective is [clean space].
    Triggering your own past writing is [Incremental Writing].
			Abstraction is a family of methods to solve the problem of not being able to come up with an idea by means of a trigger stimulus to come up with an idea.

	Apart from these, there is the problem of not being able to do what you set out to do, "[lack of motivation]" and the subspecies "[lack of time]"
		The high cost of making [decisions] about [what to do] is often overlooked
 	 Cost savings from pre-determination are [task-shooting time techniques] and [conditional planning].
		The problem of not being able to take the first step because the task is too big due to poor estimation.
  	[Pomodoro] and all sorts of incremental stuff.
  		[Incremental Reading]、[Incremental Writing]
			Increasing the accuracy of estimates through measurement is common to both [taskshooting time technique] and [Pomodoro].

	The first part of [GTD] where you write everything down and put it in one place is the same as the writing method.
	Putting it all in one place eliminates the cost of "looking for where it is".
 	[It's like the "one pocket principle" or the "one notebook" theory.
		Putting things to do in boxes and working from the top is a common technique in the education of autistic children.

	[Cybozu-style thinking and Mr. Kozaki's are also common.
 	What's the goal?
  	I have something in front of me that I don't want to do.
   	To escape energy to another escape route rather than being suppressed overall.
				Want to stay highly motivated

	Relationship to flow state, flow occurs when difficulty is moderate
 	Staying good by running away from difficult projects
  	Will that project be resumed?
		The problem of neglected projects being salted away.
  	[Mr. Yuki's star chart] is a method of taking a bird's eye view of a project to prevent it from becoming salted.

	Problems I can't recall.
 	[Make searchable]
  Set [Reminder
  Write in a notebook or something you see repeatedly.
