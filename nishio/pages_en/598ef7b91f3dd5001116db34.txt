Discretization of real numbers
1016: [Make real numbers between 0 and 1 {0, 1}.

Haar wavelet.

The real number, `[0, 1]`, is regarded as the probability that 1 is chosen from {0, 1}. For example, a ray of light reflected on a surface with a reflectance of 0.8 is not traced by multiplying the brightness by 0.8, but by total reflection with a probability of 0.8, thereby reducing the amount of calculation for the remaining 0.2.

In the planetarium Megastar, the stars are displayed as a stochastic gradation to cover the misalignment caused by the boundary of the lens.

Represents intermediate colors by [dithering] in an environment with a small number of colors.
