Discretionary Labor and Flexible Work Hours
>Miyamoto, Kunio... The difference at my place of work...
>Flex: Standard working hours per month are set (7.5 hours * working day), and as long as you work the standard working hours during the month, you are free to work any time per day. As long as there are no obstacles to your work, you may come anytime before core hours and leave anytime after core hours, but you must be present during core hours (in our case, 10:00 - 15:00). Any hours worked in excess of the standard working hours will be recorded as overtime hours.
>Discretionary labor: If you work even one minute in a day (in extreme cases), you have worked that day. No standard working hours (no core hours).
>If there is no particular obstacle to your work, you can come anytime and leave anytime.
>No concept of overtime hours as there are no standard working hours (so overtime hours are deemed).

>Yuki Tamura: Since the discretionary labor system and flexible work hours are not upwardly compatible in terms of the system, I think it would be better to make sure that overtime pay and legal holidays are properly accounted for.
	>nishio I know it's not a standalone upper level, but I think it's upper level because the current situation is with deemed overtime, am I overlooking something?
  > Yuki Tamura: The same deemed overtime, but flex is when the prescribed working hours and the deemed overtime hours are exceeded,
  > Is it where it is obligatory to pay additional overtime, but not obligatory under the discretionary labor system?
  > This is also why the discretionary labor system is so easily abused to reduce overtime pay, though.
  >If almost no one is currently working more than the deemed overtime hours, then there is no disadvantage in moving from a flex to a discretionary work system.
  > If you have an operation where it is not appropriate to set up meetings during flexible hours because core and flexible hours will be eliminated, that may change.
