circular referencing
	Circulatory references are often thought of as if they are bad
	It's good if it's beneficial even if it's a circular reference.
	At first glance, it may sound like a radical thought, "It's okay to make circular references."
		But there is nothing strange about a value X being expressed as [$ X_{t+1}=f(X_t)] in a [dynamic system
		It's not even strictly a circular reference because the time is off.
	It is [excessive abstraction] that humans equate [$ X_{t+1}] and [$ X_t] by calling both "X"!
