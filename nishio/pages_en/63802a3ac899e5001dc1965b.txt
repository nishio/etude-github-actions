Keep a large network and cut out as needed
Long-term [intellectual production] policy
	I think keeping [a large network] and [cutting out] [as needed] is intellectually productive in the long run.
 	First, create a [knowledge network] with [consistency
 	　I'll add a little more and accumulate a little more.
 	　　[Image of water falling from stalactites and pooling].
 	　It is important to [maintain consistency] rather than accumulate random information
 	　　[on the basis of integrity].
 　After the [specific need] is identified, take out [only where necessary] for that [need].
 　　It's easier to decide whether to cut the edge of the network or not if you can see a specific need.
 　　　We can decide if we need it or not."
 　　　If [the purpose is clear], we can use [usefulness for the purpose] as the definition of correctness.
 　　　　[clarification of purpose].
 　　　　[Pragmatism]

　There was a "potentially useful concept" that was very exciting and [overgrown] in one project.
　The members of that project had a desire to organize things in a clean way, not in a messy way.
　　But no one could do it.
　After the need arose to mention it in another project, a smooth restructuring took place
　　It was organized at the time when the concept was separated from [its roots in] "[its birthplace]" and [replanted] in another place.

from [/villagepump/how about notation].
 One person brought up the topic and a lot of people thought it was interesting and got excited.
 To compare it to a plant, if you plant a seed, it grew.
 The seeds are.
 　Instead of growing up "neatly behaved and ready to ship."
 　[Branches grow from here and there, overgrowing into a mess].
 　[branches sprouting from here and there] / [messy] / [overgrown].
 I find this overgrowth beneficial.
 　I think [harvesting and polishing it up nicely can be done later].
			You can [harvest] and polish it up nice and clean [later].

from [/villagepump/how about notation "enables the description of knowledge that can be easily reused"?]
　It was argued that "removing context from knowledge makes it more reusable."
　Seems to me there are two opinions on what knowledge reuse is
　　A
 　　To cut out what is written here and take it elsewhere.
　  　There's a sense that "[first-timers]" are close to reading it as it's placed here.
　  　[place] and [context] are close in meaning, first-timers "[don't know the context]."
　　B
　　 That what is written here, here, is developed by others who mention it and so on.
　　To be a material for a developing future.
	　The act of trying to do A in this situation seems to me to be interfering from B's point of view.
	　　To use a plant analogy [cutting and arranging the roots of a growing flower into a form that can be distributed as a commodity is counter to maintaining a place where miscellaneous plants can thrive].
	　　Cutting [the roots] of the flowers that are growing and arranging them [into a form that can be distributed] as a commodity goes against maintaining [a place where miscellaneous plants can thrive].
	　　　Information [Packaging
	　　　[Books are already a product of abstraction.]

Thoughts divorced from concrete context
　It tends to be this.
　　[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected].
　It's [rootless knowledge].
