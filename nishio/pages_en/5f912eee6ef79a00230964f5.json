　Thoughts.
　　Isn't it simply DP?
　　No. A simple DP would be 10^10 for the largest case, so it's impossible.
　　Is it a problem that can be mathematically transformed to arrive at a solution of smaller order?
　　This is, in essence, asking for the number of ways to choose the H times to move vertically out of the W+H times, so we can find [$ C(W+H, H)].
　公式解説
　　I've read about finding the inverse of the factorial to get this, but it's known to me.
　　Did I put this together on one of the pages?
　　I wrote [combination in mod P].
