Community is an echo chamber
On the way back from the Unexplored Conference 2019
 [Unexplored Conference Summary https://togetter.com/li/1326529]
>I thought that the contagion of enthusiasm and the tolerance of being an oddball are beneficial in their own right, but if we abstract the phenomenon that is happening one step further, it is an [echo chamber]. We need to quickly counteract strange ideas before they are echoed. Some that have occurred in the past are "entrepreneurship is good" and "the rest of us are inferior." Both were quelled at one time or another, but could flare up again at any time.
>[Community] is certainly beneficial, but when it becomes "I'm awesome for belonging to this community," it turns into an elective system. It is not that the community is great or that the people who belong to the community are great, but that the individual people are great and the community is beneficial because it has the effect of creating opportunities to create synergy with those people.

The next day [community boundaries and familial similarities].
