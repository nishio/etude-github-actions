Group formation based on familial similarity
>When you find one that seems to be related, move it so that the two warps are close to each other. By repeating this process, a group of warp lines that seem to be related to each other will gradually form.
[The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production] p.152 [(5.2.3) Move the possibly related items closer to each other].


This is [grouping] based on [familial similarity].
What's the difference between [classification] and
	Classification is done by first determining "characteristics common to the group" and then deciding whether a person is a member of the group or not based on the presence or absence of those characteristics.
	On the other hand, grouping based on [familial similarity] only requires a relationship among its members and no common characteristics.

It seems we need advice to release the captivity of "we must create a group with common characteristics."
