Heroku
>Why Heroku now? It's because alerts and dashboards lead you to human-readable explanatory text, and you can re-design your application to be scalable and easy to operate in line with 12 factor apps. I'm developing a lot with about 60 pull requests a month, and Heroku allows me to run it all by myself.
