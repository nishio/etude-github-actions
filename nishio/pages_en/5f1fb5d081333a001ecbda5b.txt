Covered by experience
>Umehara: "I saw a young overseas player who clearly had excellent dynamic vision, and when I thought about what I could do in response, I thought about using my experience to cover for that, but then I thought that thinking is like being an old man. I thought, "That's not right, I have to become this. That's when I started practicing."

I've been trying to figure out why "experience covers" is an old man's idea.
　Vague on what exactly "covered by experience" means.
　They think they can "cover it with experience."
　　It's unclear what exactly that is.
　　A kind of unfounded faith.
　Assumes that past "experience" will continue to be beneficial in the future.
　　That assumption has not been verified.
