link title suggestion
I want to separate and realize only the link title suggestion part of Scrapbox.
	It is possible to get a list of linked titles of other people's projects with the [titles API].
	There is a publicly available implementation of [asearch], which can be used to prototype
	Create a prototype that writes out a list of link titles locally and uses them as the target of asearch to suggest text as it is being typed.
