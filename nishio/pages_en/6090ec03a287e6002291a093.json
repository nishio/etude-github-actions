 *1270952778* "Did You Know" - What I thought when I saw the comments on the Japanese translation.
 Someone commented now on the <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090401/1238588872#tb'>"Did You Know" Japanese translation</a> I translated a year ago...
 
 I wonder, what's the benefit of such a tut-tutting on a translation that is a year old? I wonder if he thinks he's winning by criticizing.
 
 It takes much less effort to belittle than it does to create value and content. Anyone who has experienced creating knows this, so they don't think criticism that doesn't produce added value is cool. The general trend of comments seems to be that early comments add value to the content, and then there is an increase in "just consuming" and "feedback that doesn't add value".

 http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20100411/1270952778 I don't know if that comment was meant to be a kudos. I didn't think it was even a criticism, I thought it was a comment that should be written on the back of a flyer. If it was a compliment, then it was a criticism, regardless of its merit or value.

 Ah, I see, I see. I was wondering what the point of writing this comment was, but since it's a "write it on the back of a flyer" comment, there's no point to begin with. It's not a communication in the first place.

 Roughly translated, "District 6 is the name of a settlement in the city of Cape Town, famous for the forced eviction of more than 6,000 people due to apartheid since 1970."
 
 When I learned that it was set in Johannesburg, I thought, "Why Johannesburg?" but it had a deeper meaning, or rather, most of the meaning was that.

 <body>In the case of a comment section that you can control, you can stop accepting comments after a certain period of time and only get the added value.

 <body>Just as bauxite had no value until aluminum refining was invented, in this case it was not the author of the comment who added value, but me who found the value! (Oo</body>
