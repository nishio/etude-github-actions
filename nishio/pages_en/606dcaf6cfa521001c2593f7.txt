When the contents of ✅ brackets contain punctuation, they are not used as keywords.
Due to [✅ Make the contents of parentheses into keyword candidates], lines and other items enclosed in parentheses are now also made into keywords in their entirety.
I feel like that's not too bad if a human chooses it well, but if a computer does it 100% of the time, it's not good, so I don't keyword it when it contains punctuation.
