			　Information exchange through people
		Idea flow
			Foundation of [collective knowledge
		[Engagement]
			What is Engagement?
				Occurs primarily within groups of peers [social learning].
				Formation of [code of conduct
				Formation of [social pressure] to enforce
			For example, at [Cybozu] there is a code of conduct that says information sharing is a good thing, and social learning takes place by actually watching others share more and more information.

Is information sharing a good thing?

　We've observed that [echo chambers] occur and performance drops when information distribution speeds are high.

 The quest for good results
 　Social learning is extremely important
 　　Combining successful imitation of others with personal learning is superior to personal learning alone
 　Diversity is important
 　Avoid [echo chamber
 　People who behave irrelevantly to others are important.
 　　May have information that counteracts the effects of social impacts
 　　I can't tell if you're a wise man or a freak.
 　　　In the case of Eatlo, we could determine this by looking at the performance
 　　See if there is a common opinion
 　　[nishio.icon]I don't think that would filter out the common trait of "going against the grain of common sense" when there are naturalists who simply go against the grain...

collective intelligence
　Groups perform better than isolated individuals.
　Patterns of interaction that contributed to the emergence of collective intelligence
　　[Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups]
　Most Contribution
　　Participants in the conversation are speaking equally.

　 　　Predicting what others will say
　 　　If the prediction is correct, we ignore that information because it's already common knowledge.
　 　the wise
　 　　Find people who can predict other people's behavior and yet act differently
　 　　Being predictable means you have a good understanding of common social perceptions.
　 　　If you act differently on it, there's some reason for it.
　 　　　You have information that others don't have, etc.
　 　　　Maybe it's just [nishio.icon]innocent?
