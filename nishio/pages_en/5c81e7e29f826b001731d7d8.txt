someone who hinders others
 There are certain types of projects that take longer to accomplish.
  For example, diet
 Some people point out to those who are working on such projects, saying, "You're not getting any results at all.
 I used to think of people like that as "I've never worked on a time-consuming project myself, so they don't understand how time-consuming it is."
 My wife says there's a pattern of people who have worked on it but failed, and they're trying to make you fail.
 	I do it because I don't want to attribute my failures to myself personally.
 	I'd like to think the project failed because it was difficult.
 	When others succeed, it becomes clear that you are just incompetent.
	 Invite a dieter to a cake buffet.
