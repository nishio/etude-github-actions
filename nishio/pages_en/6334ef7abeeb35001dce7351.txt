Cat Rumble
>[https://twitter.com/mitoconcon/status/1567466430987403264?s=21&t=ya4Pt2I0ru_emrHn1mARgg @mitoconcon]: This is still undisclosed information, but if you attach your ears to the base of the cat's arms and around the shoulder blades, you can hear the rumbling. If you put your ear from the base of the cat's arm to the shoulder blade area, you can hear the cat's loud gurgling and make a lot of progress. I tried various places such as the stomach and forehead, but this place sounded the best.
