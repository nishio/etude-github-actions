Calibration meeting generation process
Meeting to [calibrate] communication
Monthly 1on1 between [Tomoya Tachikawa] and Nishio
see [calibration meeting].

Notes on outbreak process
　In 2018, Tachikawa tried to use Nishio for a BMOT event, and since the two choices were about a month apart when trying to coordinate dates, Nishio said, "Why not both instead of either?" ([wrong choice of two]), which led to events being held once a month.
  >2018-05-30
  >T: There is a classroom available for 6/20 or 7/11. How is Nishio-san's availability?
  >N: Both are fine, so let's hold both!
  >T: Ewww, I hadn't thought of that idea.
  >N: Isn't that a once-a-month pace?
 This caused "meetings for events" to occur at a monthly pace.
 The event itself disappeared after about five sessions, but the meetings themselves were continued because both parties felt they were beneficial.
 I've experimented with a lot of things, not just 1-on-1.
　 2019-06 [KJ method for "interesting"].
　Calibration meeting was called in 2019.
  >2019-09-12
  >N: Where is the best place to schedule a regular calibration for September, other than 26 or 27 for the rest of the month?
  >T: How about either 18 or 30 for the dates?
  >T: (named "regular calibration session")
		This led to the event being called a "calibration meeting" every time, and "what is calibration?" was delved into after the fact see May 2020

		[Rope parable]
 　　I think we need to not only do 1-on-1s, but also turn the keywords that come out of them into "ropes".
