Conflicting labels are placed close together.
If you're thinking of ideas for improving your office and you're looking at labels for opinions from various employees...
 The office is cold."
 It's hot in my office."
Suppose we find seemingly contradictory labels such as

Should these two pieces be placed close together or far apart?

This should be placed nearby. If it is placed far away, it will create an axis of conflict in the space.

By the way, these two labels are very abstract. To put it another way.
　[Jiro Kawakita.icon] "There is no [scent of earth]."
 [nishio.icon] "A floating plant that has no roots in the earth ([parable of the floating plant and the tree])."

Let's be more specific and ask the person who wrote this label to be more specific. Suppose, for example, you get a reply like this.
　When you come home after walking in the heat, it takes a long time for the sweat to subside if the temperature is low.
　My legs get cold, so I use a kneeling pad all the time.

With the addition of the unlabeled information, I can see the situation more clearly. One side is talking about walking home from a hot outside office, and the other side is talking about being inside the company all the time.

In light of this, the two views are not contradictory. For example, this kind of compatibility can be conceived
 How about building one room with strong air conditioning and making it a free address system so that those who want to use it can use it?

In this way, by resolving seemingly contradictory data inconsistencies, we are one step closer to solving the problem.
