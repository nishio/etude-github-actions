 *1412231847* How Engineers Learn: Summary of Interview with Mr. Ozaki
 In the "<a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/search.html?tag=%E7%B6%9A%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A2%E3%81%AE% E5%AD%A6%E3%81%B3%E6%96%B9'>How Engineers Learn | The Cybozu Way</a>" We published an interview with Mr. Ozaki in the second to ninth articles of the series. The ninth installment is now complete, so we would like to look back on it all together here.
 
 Actually, this interview took place on May 22, so I had four months after that to put into practice what I learned. I have added that as well.
 
 ** <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000316.html'>Second Edition</a>
 
 It is important to do a little bit every day, and for this purpose, we talked about preparing "a system that makes it easy to take the first step" such as "the source code can be viewed at the same speed as a Google search.
 
 I had been using Bookscan to digitize my books, but until I heard about this talk, the data was in the cloud and "downloaded when I thought I needed it". After hearing this talk, I kept all the data at hand so that I can read it anytime, and I also converted everything to text and put it in one folder for easy cross-search. This is quite convenient.
 
 Another important point was that it is better not to do it because it would be a waist of time to try to recover.
 
 ** <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000317.html'>3rd</a>
 
 He said that it is important to set a deadline, otherwise you will be running toward a very distant goal.
 
 He said it is especially important to set "deadlines for outputs" such as study group presentations.
 
 ** <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000318.html'>Fourth Edition</a>
 
 He told us that the success he achieved not by doing what he was told to do, but by thinking for himself and doing it in a better way, was an important turning point that led him to where Mr. Ozaki is today.
 
 He also said that it is important to be involved in multiple projects to make multiple lines of development enjoinable, because if you only work, you will suffer.
 
 ** <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000319.html'>5th</a>
 
 Mr. Ozaki said that his character of not being good at using things he does not understand without understanding them, combined with the environment of working with Linux, where he can see what is inside by reading the source code, has shaped him into the person he is today.
 
 He also said that when you are learning something new that is new to you, you need to take some consecutive time to concentrate on it and only do it.
 
 ** <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000320.html'>6th</a>
 
 He said that in order to train concentration, you should first train it with something you like, such as a game, and that trying to concentrate on studying or work from the beginning is just increasing your chances of falling behind.
 
 He also said that it is important to use that concentration to pick up a lot of books anyway and read them without worrying if you don't understand them. This is because if you do this and put yourself in a state where you "have read it before," you will have the possibility of connecting with it later.
 
 I see what you mean about choosing university (undergraduate) textbooks as the subject of your reading. After learning this, I started looking for a list of textbooks published by some universities when I look for books to learn about a field I am not familiar with.
 
 ** <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000321.html'>7th</a>
 
 The talk was about comparing organizations that are active and those that are passive to discussion. It was a practical discussion about not discussing with people who are reluctant to discuss, and informal ways of communicating questions rather than overtly discussing in organizations that are reluctant to discuss.
 
 Perhaps the reason why the Linux kernel development community has been able to successfully turn around with a positive attitude toward discussion is that it is pragmatic and therefore less likely to devolve into emotional conflict.
 
 ** <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000341.html'>8th</a>
 
 Throughout the entire interview, I was most impressed by this article. I tend to think, "Continuation is power, I have to keep going," and then get down on myself, thinking, "How bad am I if I can't keep going? I felt like the scales fell from my eyes when the author made the comment, "Instead of setting a goal to keep going, it is more positive to break it down into smaller goals.
 
 ** <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000342.html'>9th</a>
 
 He said that textbooks don't match your level, but a human instructor does. Another advantage of a human instructor over a textbook is that if you want an immediate answer to a question, you can ask a question on the spot. After hearing this story, I started attending an English conversation school.
 
 He also said that output-driven is better because it is difficult for someone who is trying to learn something to judge the quality of the input. The importance of "output with deadlines in small units" has been reiterated throughout the 3rd and 8th sessions, and I still think this is the most important part throughout this interview.
 
 ** Next notice
 
 The next installment will be a two-part series of answers to questions we received at the start of the series about the certification exam, followed by a second interview project. I also talked about what I learned from this interview in <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20140918/1411009426'>my keynote speech</a> at PyCon JP 2014 and other events. I think it will be interesting to read the story while comparing it with Mr. Kozaki's since it is a different approach. Please look forward to it.
