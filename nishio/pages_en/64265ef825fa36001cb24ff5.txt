stamp notation
is probably not the name of the named now to refer to this concept.

A few days? ago, I started actively using a notation that further brackets and expands [icon notation
	concrete example
		[[[pile on top.icon]]]

I feel this is very good.
　The "[name]" is a [handle][[handle.icon]] for the "[concept]", but existing word combinations are not always the best way to refer to that concept
　　Sometimes I feel it's better represented with images.
