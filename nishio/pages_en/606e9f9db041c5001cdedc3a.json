>Computers - If you are not literate, don't expect respect from your employees. It is routine for them. Take it for granted that your boss is computer -literate. My five year old granddaughter would not respect me if I told her that grandpa is afraid of the phone. She would not trust me.
> As times change, we ourselves must change. We must move from a minimum level of computer literacy, which is little more than reading, writing, and multiplication, to the realm of "information literacy," the ability to use information to get things done. It is an interesting and worthwhile challenge.
> We are in the midst of such a current. The flow is fast.
