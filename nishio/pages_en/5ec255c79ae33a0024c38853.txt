Problem Solving Case Studies
I have a different pattern of [problem solving] than the [problem solving method], so let's try to verbalize the process.

	Different situations have different beginnings.
	In the most recent case, we started out with a "usual meeting" format.
	As usual, I spoke normally and took the minutes as usual,
	In the process, I realize, "Oh, this is beyond the scale of what a [flesh-and-blood] person can organize in his or her brain.
	A mode change is taking place in me.
		At this time, there is no explicit "let's use whatever method" field switch.
		Only my behavior changes.
	I abandoned my attempt to pick up the pieces on the spot.
		Later turn into action to organize yourself with the assistance of the tool.
 	Specifically:
 		Focus on verbalizing and recording the opinions of others rather than expressing your own
 		Ask questions to make the abstract concepts used by others as concrete as possible.
 			What exactly is that capability?"
 			Capability and resource are they the same concept? Are they different concepts?"
	Then make hundreds of sticky notes based on the record of the minutes and organize them
		That raises a specific question.
			"There's an arrow drawn from A to B. What exactly is [this arrow]?"
			You talk about C being an important resource, but how do you acquire it?"
			ã€€[How do we get those resources?"]
	Feedback on the question will give you new information.

When done individually, this corresponds to [hooks for fishing something that has not yet been verbalized]. The pattern of this time is not to do the hooking work for your own personal fishing ground, but to do it for multiple people other than yourself at the same time and in parallel.
