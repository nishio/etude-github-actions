Not "it's hard," but "I don't know of an easy way."
 Whether or not it is [old person]-like to comment, "That's difficult," in response to "I want to do something like this, or I'm thinking of doing something like this."
 The seniors might say, "I'm not old because I'm providing useful information," but is that information useful in the first place or not?
 Beneficial or harmful?
 It is possible that "it's difficult" is "just difficult for seniors who don't know the latest ecosystem", and since humans are naturally not omniscient, such things can happen, but it is harmful to act as if your subjective feeling of "it's difficult" is an objective fact without being aware of it.
	Not "[difficult]," but "I don't know how to do that easily."
	It's becoming much clearer. So "difficult" is [an interpretation, not a fact].
	If the statement "it's difficult" is subjective and conveys to the listener that it is something that can be overturned by the listener, then it is harmless, but if it is expressed in a way that the listener misinterprets it as fact, then it is harmless.
