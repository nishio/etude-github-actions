Definition of work
 You must define for yourself what your job is.
  and especially [Drucker] and others say
 You can't do that in the early stages of your life.
  Cases that cannot be defined in the first place
  Cases where the definition of "this is what I do" does not fit the need.
 The bosses know you can't do that early in life, so they define it and give it to you.
  It is more productive in the short term.
  But when and how on earth do you acquire the skills to define your own work?
  In the long run, aren't there significant disadvantages by undermining opportunities for skill acquisition?
