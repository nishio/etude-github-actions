ðŸ¤”Task Management Chatbot
I want a chatbot to manage tasks.
ã€€[There are two types of task management.]
ã€€ã€€There are three parts: making it a clear task, prioritizing that task (or rather, choosing one of the highest priorities), and managing its status.
ã€€ã€€So you want each user to have a memory.
ã€€[task is what to do].
