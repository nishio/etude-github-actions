 > ScrapBox by Nisio and others has a small [granularity of entries] and is really more like [fragments] [scraps of notes] than a text manuscript, but but it's easy to absorb essential knowledge and think a lot about it!
 In this case, there is a size of text appropriate to the content to be expressed, and books are in a bad state: "often too large," and "when trying to point to a part, page numbers are generally used, but with the advent of kindle-like e-books, broken links occur.
 Scrapbox, on the other hand, has a [human-readable permalink] for each unit of content, and even if you rename it, it will redirect and connect to you, which is a nice improvement.
 So I have a lot of doubts about the book as a [form of] knowledge representation, and I feel that we are not receiving the benefits of the age of improved [information pointing] with the creation of the concept of [permalinks].
	I think it's a bad idea to "go back to page-based books" because there must be good points in Kindle books, the kind of thing that [if you change something and have a problem with it, you don't change it back, you change it further].
	And so I thought it would be nice to have the ability to select "places to mention" and create permalinks, and if you could give them human-readable names, even after the fact, it would be Scrapbox-like.
	It would be nice to have a list of the marked parts after reading a long sentence by selecting a part of the sentence and pressing the "mark" button (Kindle could do something similar up to this point).
 It would be nice if this grouping could be made into individual pages with titles, instead of just being lumped together in one view.
 Instead of creating content with a title in advance, [the content comes first] and then [the title is added after the fact].
