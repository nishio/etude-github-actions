A model where only the top players in the market get utility.
 Context: [Optimizing time allocation for learning].
 Ah, a model where only [top players] in [market] get [utility], that's surprisingly interesting. One would think that the non-linear effect would affirm specialization in a particular domain because the points of contact are so far apart, but a strategy could be established whereby multiple domains are crossed to create a niche and make it easier to get to the top. Interesting. #Multi-domain niche-top strategy

  nishio> The preliminary stage was a flatter image. My first image of an example where only the market leader could get utility was a professional chess player or a professional gamer.
  tokoroten> I think it's personal salary based, the vertical axis. On a corporate value basis, I think the front end would be much flatter. Because the strength of a company is that it can multiply more multiple domains than an individual.
		nishio> Ah, I see, the first part is [fat-tailed] by the effect of [minimum wage] or the effect of the increase in [recruitment and education costs] because they get away with too low a wage.
