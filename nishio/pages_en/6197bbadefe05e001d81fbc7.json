Differences between the Micra Integrated Version and the Java Version
統合版=Bedrock Edition=BE
Java版=Java Edition=JE
Nishio's summary of this difference

　Integrated version if you want to play on Switch
　Java version for the type of people who are not satisfied with playing a given game.

If you just want to play a given game, you can play the integrated version on the Switch or whatever. This is not meant to be a mockery, but rather a recommendation that depends on how interesting you find the non-game aspects of the game.

The Java version allows you to set up your own server.
Some servers have plug-ins that can add functionality.
You can tweak the file at hand to change the monster design, place your own objects in the world, etc.

My kid has a Switch Micra and now he wants the Java version, what's the difference?"
It is like a child who has been playing with a "coloring book that already has line drawings and you can only paint those drawings" saying, "I want a blank free-form book where I can freely draw pictures. Even though the use of colored pencils is the same, the things that can be done are completely different. The biggest difference is that the "door of possibility" is open to do anything.
