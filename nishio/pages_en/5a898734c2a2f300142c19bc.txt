How to Create Social Relationship Capital
 In my inaugural address to the board of directors of the Unexplored Association of Japan, I wrote
  >"Gathering is the first step, staying together is progress, working together is success," says Ford. Of course it is important to gather people at events, but it should not be a one-off event where people have fun for a day and that is the end of it. There needs to be a place where the gathered people "stay together". We believe it is important to create such a place both physically and electronically.

 One way to bring people in is to say, "I have a specific project that sounds fun, and I'm going to participate in it."
  When it comes to "creating a concrete, enjoyable project," you need "conceptual ability to create something out of nothing" that cannot be outsourced to a part-time job or something.

 I wonder if the driving force is "the desire to realize a system that I think would be good to have" or something like that.
  When a graduate wants to do something and it involves more than one graduate, that in itself is an opportunity to create social relational capital among graduates through [collaboration].
  The "system I think would be good to have" I want to create is a feedback loop in which intangible capital accumulates with unexplored foundations as its core, and the gravitational pull of that capital attracts more capital.
  So you're inclined to support a project that involves multiple alumni because it contributes to it.
