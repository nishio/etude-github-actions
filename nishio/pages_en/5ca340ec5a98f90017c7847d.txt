reverse search
 A normal [search] is an operation that performs some computation on a set of documents D using a query q and returns the result
		That is, [$ f(D_i, q) \to \mathbb{R}]
		naively, "1 if document Di contains q"
		It is often done by returning some kind of score and displaying them in order of highest to lowest.
 [Chatbot] conversations are searched in response to user utterances (example of an implementation)
 	The [$ (q_i, D_i)] is prepared in advance and [$ f(P, q_i)\to\mathbb{R}] is computed for the user's utterance P.

		Left ordered search if you interpret explicit bracketing of links as an input to the search query.
		If you do "Automatically link when a link title that has already appeared", the page will be P and the link title set will be q reverse search
