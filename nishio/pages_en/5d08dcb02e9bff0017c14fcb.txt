	Actually, it is possible to force keywords by writing `[Pirika-chan]` (grammar for testing), but even if you do it once, the current implementation does not extract the expression "Pirika-chan" as a keyword after that, so it is very subtle.
	Once something is recognized as a keyword, it could be checked to see if it is included in every user input.
