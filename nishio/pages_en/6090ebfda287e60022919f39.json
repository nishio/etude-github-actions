 I'm not upset because I can't wake up! I'm not mad at you for not being able to get up!

 It was down.
 His body is very hot but he doesn't seem to have a fever. It is a mystery.

 Headache. It's tough. Nothing is going on.
 
 So, according to my schedule, today is the day I receive the keys to my new house. I haven't made any arrangements for moving yet....
 
 
 What we do today
 - Wake up in the morning
 - Collecting mail that had accumulated in the mailbox.
 -- □ Throw away what you don't need
 --- ← □ □ I'll buy a bag of burnable trash because it's depleted.
 - Wash dishes
 - □ Wash PET bottles
 - □ Write a reply to your email
 - □ My credit card was not accepted and maybe the amount of deposit in the bank is short. I go to bookkeeping. But usually you get a phone call or an e-mail or something.
 -- ■ I tried to view my Rakuten KC statement on the web, but the system had changed, so I am registering as a member. □ I change my address after moving.
 - □ Clean up the room
 - Map
 - Headphones
 - □ Summarize how to create a GAE project
 - □ About Mercurial's bisect
 
 the others
 - 15 Receive keys to new house
 - 18 Resource Trash Day. Throw away as much unwanted newspapers, magazines, etc. as possible.
 - 20 pots / debit your Rakuten card
 - 28 Return of keys to current address
 - I'll get a haircut soon (maybe next time I'm in Akihabara).
