Changes in the way we learn
Compared to 100 years ago, there has been a huge change in [how] we learn [what is worth learning].
For example, in [learning programming], it is not appropriate for 50 students in one class to learn by transcribing what the teacher writes on the blackboard in their notebooks.

This change is due to the new and increased number of "things worth learning.
The appropriate [way of learning] differs depending on [the subject], and since there are more new subjects, new ways of learning are needed.
For those who do not see this "new increase", there appears to be no change.
