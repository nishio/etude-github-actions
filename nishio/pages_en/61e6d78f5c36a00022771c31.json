ToMyProj
User script to extract the original text without destroying it
	Originally created "to copy and organize the content written in other projects into your own project.
		So the source link and icon are supposed to be the name of the project.
　2022-11-25 I've been using it for a while and found it useful within the same project
　　The current official "New Page" functionality changes the content of the original page.
　　So the psychological hurdle is high, as you have to use it while worrying about whether the change will have a negative impact.
　　It would be less painful to extract the "original page unchanged" once, organize it, and then consider whether to erase or modify the description of the original page.

When you duplicate another project's description in your own project
　Make the icon a reference to the original project so that it is not broken
　Insert source link

turn out like this
	[Well 2022-01-17] title was tweaked.
　　Whether the link in the project should be a link to the original project...
　　　We're not going to be able to connect with anything on this side of the project.
　　　[Should not]
　　　　If there is a page with the same name in our project, it should be connected.
　　　　Not connected = not in this project" is also informative
　　　　　[notice the blank].
　　　　If you think you need it at the cost of making it, make it, and if not so much, leave it alone.

 The reference to icons of other projects from the well is broken.
 The title is "Re:", but the diary page was duplicated by mistake because the title was corrected after the fact
 　Well, but do you want to revise the title on the rest of the page?
 　Well, I can notice it because the link connects.
 Maybe the link to /nishio could be mechanically reverted to a link in the project.

　You don't necessarily want to make a page.
　　For example, when adding a reference to an existing page in another project for that page
　　So I put it in the clipboard and then asked if I could create a page.

ToMyProj
code:script.js
	scrapbox.PopupMenu.addButton({
   title: 'ToMyProj',
   onClick: text => {
     const dst = 'nishio'
     const src = scrapbox.Project.name
     const new_text = text.replace(/\[([^\]\/]+).icon\]/gm, `[/${src}/$1.icon]`)
 
     const lines = new_text.split(/[\r\n]/g)
 
     const title = scrapbox.Page.title
     lines.unshift(`from [/${src}/${title}]`)
 
 	const title_url = encodeURIComponent(title)
     const body = lines.join('\n')
     navigator.clipboard.writeText(body).then(()=>{
       if (window.confirm("copied. create page?")) {
         const body_enc = encodeURIComponent(body)
         window.open(`https://scrapbox.io/${dst}/Re:${title_url}?body=${body_enc}`)
       }
     })
   },
 })
