Columbus and Fabre.
Interesting case study of wife's confusion.
	Columbus and dung beetle are connected by "koro".
 Fabre -> Fungkorogashi -> Columbus, and so on.

I heard that.
	I thought Fabre -> dung beetle -> round -> earth -> Columbus.

It's interesting to see the cognitive mechanisms that allow this kind of [association game] to be played.

You know "strawberries are red?" That's what I was talking about.

I'm not really aware of it, but [straw songs] are imprinted at the beginning of language development, so it could be interesting.
