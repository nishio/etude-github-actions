Accumulation of associations, not accumulation of information, is useful
Not [accumulation of information] but [accumulation of associations] is useful

It is easy to imagine a paper notebook that cannot be searched
　I've worked so hard to write down all this information, and I've accumulated so many notebooks!" and bragging about it.
　Information is accumulating.
　How often is this information retrieved?
　Sometimes associations connect.
　　'Oh, I feel like I wrote something related to this years ago.'
　　And I can't find it.
　　[A being that cannot be found is as if it did not exist.]

Electronic notes are a little better thanks to search.
　(Only if you can put the written string in the exact search keywords.
　　Often slightly shaky notation and missing.
　(and only if there are not too many hits for that keyword to be listed)

What is useful
　For every new idea X, it is good to find a past idea that is related to it
　This is "[association]."
　A system in which associations are connected rather than explicit keyword searches, etc., is useful.
