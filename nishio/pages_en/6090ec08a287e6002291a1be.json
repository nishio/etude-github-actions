 The video here that @kumajoi showed me is quite interesting, I think it is the same "MUROTO" that I and <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ny7xmCGu80'>QUMA</a>'s Hisaikei-kun released in June 2010. I think it is the same technology.

 Technically, it is easy to put only one figure on the iPad at a time, and the car shape makes it easy to predict where the figure will be held. I was a bit of a technologist, but I was always researching things like "how many figures can be put on the iPad at the same time" or "how to add a switch to the figure itself so it can take action". Also, appearance is important.
 
 *1317378952*sed diary
 I want to process only the odd numbered lines of a given file by feeding it to another command. How should I do this?
 
 I tried sed for now. Take out the odd and even lines. ref. <a href='http://www.kabipan.com/computer/sed/'>sed memo</a>
 
 >||
 $ cat t.txt | sed -e "n; d"
 $ cat t.txt | sed -e "1d; n; d"
 ||<
 
 It's done, it's done, it's done.
 
 I want to pipe the results of only the odd-numbered lines into the command and then attach them back together.
 
 Attach two files, one line at a time. ref. <a href='http://questionbox.jp.msn.com/qa4356899.html'>ksh I want to take the content from multiple files one line at a time and output it to another file - MSN Consultation Box for questions and advice</a>.
 >||
 $ paste -d "\n" t.txt t.txt 
 ||<
 
 I see that Paste can specify a delimiter.
 
 Oops, I want to feed the command and replace the vertical bars in the output result with spaces. That's sed too.
 
 Conclusion.
 >||
 $ cat t.txt | sed -e "1d; n; d" > even.txt
 $ cat t.txt | sed -e "n; d" | ./a.out | sed -e "s/|/ /g" > odd.txt
 $ paste -d "\n" odd.txt even.txt > result.txt
 ||<
 It's done, it's done. We are happy, we are happy.
 
 *1317394083*GTD leverage memo as mind map
 Great, a title full of lifehack keywords.
 
 Well, it's not strictly a mind map because there is no central image, but I just wanted to put together the various diagrams and lists from the GTD book on one sheet. There are some things I want to fix, such as "Waiting for others" is in the wrong place and lines are crossing each other, reviews are now light blue so they are hard to see, only INBOX is a picture of a box, but all the lists should be boxes, and so on. Looking forward to the next issue.
