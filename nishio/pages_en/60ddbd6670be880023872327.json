Scrapbox is difficult to use if you are blind.
It may sound obvious, but it's hard to use Scrapbox if you're blind.
I can turn on [VoiceOver] and type with my voice, but it's hard to read back what I've written.
When VoiceOver is on, what you type in with voice input is read back to you, so you're getting audio feedback on that one.

How can I read back what I have written before to do it with VoiceOver on?
　VoiceOver allows you to tap text on the screen and it will read it out loud.
　However, the text on the scrapbox screen is separated into individual letters as DOM elements, so only one letter is read when tapped
　Unable to read back in VoiceOver reading

	>Screen readout: To read the entire screen, swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen.
　I've found that this allows for continuous screen reading in Scrapbox.


----- 試行錯誤
I thought that if I opened Scrapbox in private mode, it would not be editable and I would be able to read out a whole paragraph in VoiceOver, but it was not.
In experimenting with this, I first found it very difficult to open a page with a URL specification in a browser.
　Unable to type "Yasukazu Nishio" in Safari's search field
　　It gets converted to a mysterious placeholder.
　Then I figured why not type the URL in alphabetical characters, but I couldn't quite figure out how to do that.
　What to do with multiple characters assigned to one button on a flick-in keyboard?
How in the world do they gather information about how to go about it when they are blind?
 I wonder if it's word of mouth.
 I wonder if there is some kind of page where such information is compiled.

I wonder if trying to get by with just an iPhone is a bad idea, and after all, screen readers, etc. on PCs have a long history and are easier to use.
　you could say that
