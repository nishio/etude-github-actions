Notification Relay
New [proposal to add comment functionality to Scrapbox].

I wonder if [ActivityPub] could notify user C of another user B's reaction to one user A's post.
　[https://gyazo.com/068ce5eef5fd41952e89b00407f5e35c]
 　A digests the updates made by C on Scrapbox as appropriate and posts them to Fediverse
 　B reacts to posts that flow into the Fediverse.
 　C is notified of B's reaction
 A and C are separated, so if you think, "I want to follow C, but I don't need all the Scrapbox updates," you can just follow C.
 　You can have several types of A's like "every 15 minutes", "every hour", "one post per day".
 　C follows bots of his preferred frequency.
 I think it is possible to relay a notification for A to C, because in ActivityPub terms, the notification should be a POST to a specified URL after all.
