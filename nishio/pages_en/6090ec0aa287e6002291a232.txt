 *1337589557*Diary of installing git-flow
 I wanted to put git-flow in, port install git-flow, and it was still good until I started building iconvlib and gettext and perl 5.12 and said, "Hey, come on, this is taking forever.

 I heard that you can do it. <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9621706/how-can-i-resolve-error-no-developer-directory-found-at-developer'>xcode - How can I resolve "Error: No developer directory found at /Developer"? - Stack Overflow</a>
 
 Try port install zlib again.

 Warning: Your developer_dir setting in macports.conf points to a non-existing directory. Since this is known to cause problems, please correct the setting or comment it and let macports auto-discover the correct path.

 Rewrite this and try port install zlib again.

 Hmmm.
 
 
 In the end, I found that there were many ports that did not work properly because Xcode moved from /Developrt to /Application, so I deactivated the ones that I did not seem to use, and git-flow started working somehow. I think it would have been better to add it from the source.
