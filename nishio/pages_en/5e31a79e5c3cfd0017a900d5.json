[How to measure and find PMF: Somewhat practicalï½œKenichiro Hara | Kenichiro Hara | note https://note.com/kenichiro_hara/n/nec3b6d791039]
	[Sean Ellis test]
		Would you be upset if this product disappeared tomorrow?
		1. very disappointed
  2. fairly disappointing
  3. not too bad (not very convenient)
  4. no longer using this product
		The "very disappointing" response must exceed 40%.
		Analyze the difference between 1 and 2
			I don't care about 3 or 4.
			What is the function X that one thinks is good?
			Of the 2, how many consider that function X to be the most important?
			What is the function Y that they consider "necessary" to make it better?

[You must first thoroughly satisfy your own needs].
	You are the only one in the "Narrow down the customer segment" field.
	The first approach is to become "I would be very disappointed if this product were to disappear tomorrow.
	[Product/User Fit]
		[Let's focus on Product/User Fit, which comes before Product/Market Fit https://review.foundx.jp/entry/product-user-fit-comes-before-product-market-fit]
		A more accurate paraphrase of "there was a Product/Market Fit in a small number of very early power user segments" would be "there was a Product/User Fit."
