　I was thinking before about putting up [Hananona's] stock one by one, but I never did it after all.
　It's okay if you're a day behind, but if you leave it for a while and some time goes by, you'd rather take a new picture than put up an old one.

I've had a rather busy weekday, and I've got things to do on Sunday, so I'd like to take it easy on Saturday.
 Consideration of the integration of the KJ method and the Kozane method
 　The absence of an explanation of the Kozane method in Kozaneba.
　I also need to think about what form the KJ method study group should take.
　Isn't the title "KJ method study group" a mistake to begin with?
　　Since the KJ method is a means to an end, mastering the KJ method is not a "[means to an end]".
　If you compare the KJ method with the Kozane method, you have one more leg to [stabilize on three legs].
　　What is it? I thought, "It's an outliner.

　　　I did a search and the person who would be writing it was still writing it.
　[Kozane Method and Outliner]

　Comparing the KJ method to the Outliner, the "bundling with a front cover" of the KJ method and the "folding the tree" of the Outliner would be the same
　　The problem is that it's hard to get the KJ method across to people who haven't done it to the fold.
　　This is, after all, a method of compressing and reducing the apparent volume when there is too much of it.
>The Outliner has three major functions.
> Function of the outline display
> Ability to fold outlines
> Ability to replace outlines
> Outliners can collapse outlines. What is collapsing?　It means to make it invisible. This is what makes them different from hashtags.

One-outline is an operation that does not erase each work, while the Kozane method discards the text once it is completed.

Type B writing, even in the KJ method.
