 The problem of securing the box, which had been the biggest obstacle, seems to have been solved.
 It is impossible to run a restaurant that makes a loss of 20,000 yen every day, but if you have a one-day event that makes a loss of 20,000 yen, you can make up the deficit by collecting donations. We could rent the O'Reillys for a one-day event and not have to buy them.
 
 I guess the next problem is capacity, since it looks like we can only accommodate 18 people, and it would be dreadful if people came all the way out here only to find that the place is full and they can't get in. I can't think of a good solution, but maybe we can make it possible to check the current number of seats available on our cell phones, or figure out a way to casually tell people who are coding in their seats and don't notice that there are people waiting to get in, "Move over, you piece of shit..." without offending them.
 
 *1203150013* Hourglass
 >>
 　On my desk, next to my notebook, I keep a ten-minute hourglass. Whenever I have trouble concentrating or feel myself slackening, I turn it over. I can concentrate for another 10 minutes, or take a 10-minute break, it depends on the situation.
 
 　So when things are not going well, the hourglass frequently turns over.

 　The most recent time my head was spinning was probably February 8. Yesterday was the lowest, which means that my energy cycle is approximately two weeks. However, I have a preconceived notion that "energy cycles for about two weeks," so there is a danger that I am just bringing up events that fit that description.

 For now, embed the sensor in an hourglass (abbreviated below).
 
 *1203154108*Final Tax Return
 I went to the tax office.
 
 Closed orz
 
 The magazine that mentioned about tax returns was no longer available from the station kiosk, but I went to the bookstore and found it. The amount of the prize money was exactly 200,000, and I thought to myself, "I don't have to declare miscellaneous income up to 200,000," but then I looked at my bank book and realized that I have royalties from Gijutsu Hyoron-sha, so if I add them up, they would exceed the amount. Hmmm. I have already deducted the royalty from the withholding tax, but I guess I have to add it up as the amount of miscellaneous income. It's complicated.
 
 But I didn't keep a proper bank book, so I don't know if the 200,000 in prize money was transferred after taxes or not......orz
 
 *1203155928*A word about balsamic vinegar?
 From my experience, I can say that balsamic vinegar is good for weight loss, but it may come back to bite you if you don't get used to it gradually. Don't give up!
 
 *1203159147*Housekeeping
 I washed a bag of plastic bottles and threw them away. Soon there will be no more plastic bottles in the room. Cans are already getting cleaned up weekly. When the plastic bottles are done, the paper trash will be next.
 
 I threw out the trash in the mailbox and found a postcard saying that if I didn't pay the gas bill by February 15, they would shut me off. I wonder if they have already shut it off. It's hard to have no hot water in winter.
 
 *1203173641*Cooking at Programa Cafe
 I thought it would be hard to have SPAM all over the place, so I thought I'd come up with a decent dish,
 
 >|perl|
 > perl -e "print {}"
 HASH(0x100139d8)
 ||<
 
 If you make "HASH(0xdeadbeef)" using this as an ingredient, you can eat it without any worries for now. Please don't say that it is strange that the last letter is "f".
