come-from links and mathematics
Scrapbox does not have [come-from link], so when I try to express something like mathematics, where the definition is in one place and the other place is the use of the definition, I have to make the definition side a page title instead of a link, which makes the page more divided than necessary and makes it difficult to see the page. I wonder if it would be better if we could [embed the page]...

A come-from link is a way to declare, "If a link for this keyword is pressed on another page, it will come here.
　Opposite to "goto" which is "go where you are going".
　This makes it easy to express, as in mathematics, when you have a definition in one place and want to jump to that definition in another place.

 Illustration. Blue line means link.

If you naively use the appearance of the keyword "XX sex" in Scrapbox as a link
　[https://gyazo.com/2fef695d8db6339a16cfb0d995b820ca]
　A virtual "XX sex" page would be created, and pages that use "XX sex" would be lined up on it.
　　No distinction is made between the definition and use of the concept.
　　I don't know where to look when I want to see a definition.

 Move the content that was in part B
 This would break the state of A and B being adjacent to each other.
 Would it be nice to have "[embed page]" to solve this fragmentation? I thought so.

 Row links point to the definition position
 Can be realized with little effort
 Content fragmentation will not occur.
 One click more, but you can get to the definition.
 　[if it can be found in the end].
 　The first method will become buried and unreachable as the use of the concept grows, so it would be better to point to a definition before it is born.
