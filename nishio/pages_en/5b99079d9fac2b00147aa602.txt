Why taking risks pays off.
 First, humans tend to view losses as greater than reasonable levels.
 	Tendency to be overly fearful of risk
 	[Prospect Theory]
 Then we see the "potential loss" as a loss rather than the actual expected value.
 Many people avoid that option.
 The market raises the price of what most people are trying to get.
 The result is a loss in a form that is difficult to see due to the fact that many people act together out of fear of loss itself.
  Decreased margins due to price increases and lost opportunities
 People who understand how this works feel that the "risk of not dying instantly from a failure of moderate size" is a gain.
 This "[risk is good value]" thinking mitigates the "[excessive fear of risk]" tendency at the beginning.

[Losses due to being in the majority].
