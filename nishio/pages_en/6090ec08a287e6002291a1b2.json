 I had grasped it when I read it before, up to the point of "writing down everything that's on my mind," but it turns out I forgot something very important. It's the "weekly review. If you can't keep your room tidy, even if you call a room cleaning service or something to clean it up, it will soon become messy again because you don't have the skills to maintain it. The same thing can be done by writing down everything that is bothering you and cleaning it up, but if you don't have the skills to maintain it, it will soon become a mess. It is an obvious fact, but I wonder why I could not understand it in the past.
 
 I guess it's not just a matter of "writing down on paper all the information that's on my mind in my brain," but also "rereading it every week, so whatever I don't feel like doing this week is OK to forget if I write it down here, and I'll remember it when I reread it," and only then can I be in a "forget it" state.
 
 I also need a one-page A4 GTD cheat sheet.
