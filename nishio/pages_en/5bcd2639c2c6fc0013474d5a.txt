There is a strong and weak "X is not Y" relationship.
	Weak: Negation of "X is Y
 	It merely says that "not 'every X element is a Y element'".
	Strong:
 	Claims that "not all X elements are 'Y elements.'"

	In addition, while not logically correct, humans also implicitly reason this way.
 	[implicit incorrect inference].
