　I tried [Kozaneba], which I had seen the name of but had somehow touched, through the tutorial.
　Thanks[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　Looks like a good simple digital version of the sticky note grouping thing.
 　I'm not sure how to write the arrows.
 　 It's true that the arrow function was not in the tutorial because it was added after the tutorial was created[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　 [/kozaneba-forum-jp/release-note#6139c971aff09e00001d3b81].
 　 I'll make a page for it later, since it was only explained in the release notes.
 　 Wow[/villagepump/miyamonz.icon].
 　 I wrote[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　 [Drawing a line function].
 　 Should I mentions these things?
 　 I don't think you have to[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 　 If you want to be a little more proactive, [/villagepump/takker.icon], use [@]!
　　It's probably no different or a bit faster than doing it with real sticky notes and pens, but for some reason I feel frustrated (not so much) when I do it digitally, as if I can't get more speed[/villagepump/miyamonz.icon].
　　　Why not?
　　　Maybe I'm just not used to it yet.
　　　　Maybe I'm not used to making maps with sticky notes to think in the first place[/villagepump/miyamonz.icon].
　　The moving part is not faster, but rather "infinitely wider, [you don't have to worry about the edge of the desk]" is the benefit, and the faster part is making sticky notes. There is an order of magnitude difference between drawing by hand on paper and being able to pour out multiple lines of text in one shot[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　　Indeed[/villagepump/miyamonz.icon].
　　　　I guess it's important to be infinitely spacious.
　　　　I've never done anything like this with physical sticky notes, so I wasn't aware of it.
