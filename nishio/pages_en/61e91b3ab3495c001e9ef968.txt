(Column) Nameplate and color of pieces
I was asked about how to distinguish nameplates from other pieces. You can do as you want to do. I introduce my way for your information.

I do not distinguish pieces by their color. When I did this, the appearance was beautiful, but it is troublesome to use pieces of two or more colors. 

At one time, I was surrounding the text of the nameplate with a red signature pen. However, it was too troublesome to prepare a red signature pen for me. Now I enclose the sentence of the nameplate with a black ballpoint pen, which I use to write the sentences itself. I enclose the nameplate of the nameplate double. Although it is not colorful, there is no problem in practical use. We can do it with only one stack of pieces and a black pen.

I also was asked, "is there any meaning to the color of the pieces?" It was because I used multiple colors of stickers. There is no meaning. It just happens to be because I bought a sticker set of 4 colors. (As of 2017. I bought a single color sticky set on 2018.)

I use the KJ method to raise the limits of cognitive abilities. I want to process information that I can not handle with my physical body only.

So there is no room to distinguish colors. It generates an additional cognitive task. It is a burden for me.

Perhaps buying monochrome stickers may reduce cognitive load. I have bought 4,000 papers of monochrome stickers recently, so I plan to experiment in the future. (I wrote this on 2017. I do not feel a significant difference. As of 2019.)

Meanwhile, there is a merit to use multiple colors of pieces without care. 

When you do the [time-dispersed] "[write all out]" method, the pieces which written at once are the same color in high probability. As a result, if there are multiple colors in the organized group, you can know that those pieces came from different points of time series.
