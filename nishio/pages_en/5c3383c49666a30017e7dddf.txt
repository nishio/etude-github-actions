Parable of the Ear of Rice
>The more fruitful the ears of rice are, the more they droop.

The ear of rice bows its head when it is harvested
The idea that the higher you are, the lower you should bow.
On the other hand, the idea that if you don't bow your head, it's because you don't have any fruit in your head.
