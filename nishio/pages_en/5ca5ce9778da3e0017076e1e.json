Words are not clearly defined.
When someone says, "The [definition] of a word is not clear," often defining the word does not solve the problem because what the person is really looking for is not "a clear definition of the word."

If there is no consensus on the definition of the word to be used in the definition, it will only lead to further discussion of the definition of it. Related: [infinite regress].
