Support for proposals to create new
[* 1st time].
[nisbot.icon]What kind of person is that for?
[nishio.icon] who is trying to propose to create something new.
[nisbot.icon]What would that person like to see happen?
[nishio.icon]I hope you can talk convincingly about how good it would be to make that.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen for that to happen?
I hope [nishio.icon]what you make is connected to a concrete experience.
[nisbot.icon]How can I do that?
[nishio.icon]You can start by talking about what you want to make and then dig deeper and get to specific episodes.
[nisbot.icon] You can do it, can't you?
[nishio.icon]I think we could create a chat system that would allow us to do that.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "chat system" is that "chat system"?
[nishio.icon]This chat system asks a human a question and then pulls the words out of the human by twisting his or her head to answer it.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "chat system"?
[nishio.icon]I personally have been using the general-purpose mode for convenience, but the general-purpose mode seems to be difficult for new users to understand how to use it, so I am creating a purpose-specific mode.
[nisbot.icon]What "generic mode" is that "generic mode"?
[nishio.icon]A mode that can be used for any purpose
[nisbot.icon]What "mode" is that "mode"?
[nishio.icon]Until the specialized mode was created, there was only one mode, but then the questions were too abstract, so we limited the purpose and asked questions specific to that purpose.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "mode"?
[nishio.icon]Again

[* 2nd time].
[nisbot.icon]What kind of person is that for?
[nishio.icon]People who are trying to propose creating something new, but have not created a story to tell it convincingly.
[nisbot.icon]What would that person like to see happen?
[nishio.icon]It's easier to construct a good story when you can pull out as many words as possible that provide material for assembling the story.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice to have software that assists in pulling out the unspoken things that are still in your mind and putting them into words.
[nisbot.icon]How can I do that?
[nishio.icon]Interacting with that software gives us a lot of material, and we can connect it together.
[nisbot.icon] You can do it, can't you?
[nishio.icon]I'm starting to feel like improving the question a little bit.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "question" is that "question"?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice if the last part was "can it be done". Also, the general focus on "phenomenon" rather than "thing" may be too abstract.
[nisbot.icon]What "phenomenon" is that?
[nishio.icon]Again

[* 3rd time].
[nisbot.icon]What kind of person is that for?
[nishio.icon]People who are trying to make something new and want to tell a compelling story about how it would be good to make it, but can't create a story that leads to a specific episode.
[nisbot.icon]What would that person like to see happen?
[nishio.icon]You can recall episodes where being asked a question would provide material for a story.
[nisbot.icon]What would it take for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]We need a chat system that will ask questions that will help us remember.
[nisbot.icon]How can I do that?
[nishio.icon]I don't see any questions that would elicit specific episodes, if that's what you need.
[nisbot.icon]What can you do to help?
[nishio.icon]Thinking about good questions
[nisbot.icon]
 > I don't see any questions that would elicit specific episodes, if that's what you need.
 What kind of "episode" is this "episode"?
[nishio.icon]You've experienced it yourself.
[nisbot.icon]
 > You should recall episodes where the questions asked provide material for a story.
 What is the "story" of this "story"?
[nishio.icon]Why is it necessary to make it
[nisbot.icon]
 > I don't see any questions that would elicit specific episodes, if that's what you need.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "episode"?
[nishio.icon]I guess I should ask the question about what made you think it was necessary to make it.
[nisbot.icon]What is the "trigger" for this?
[nishio.icon]Again

[* 4th time].
[nisbot.icon]What kind of person is that for?
[nishio.icon]People who are trying to make something new and want to explain convincingly that it is a good idea to make it.
[nisbot.icon]What would that person like to see happen?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice to be able to explain it persuasively and get support for making it.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]We need to make people who are listening to us think, "I see.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of things would make it so?
[nishio.icon]Stories based on real-life experiences
[nisbot.icon]What made you think that way?
[nishio.icon]Well, as a mentor for the Junior Unexplored Program, I read many people's proposals, and the proposals that seem to be made by piecing together articles from the Internet don't look at all interesting. You don't have to be that person to say that. If the story is connected to the person's personal experience, I get a sense of what they are talking about.
[nisbot.icon]What can you do to help?
[nishio.icon]Sometimes I ask them in interviews, but since the number of people I can call for an interview is limited, I end up losing about 90% of them in the application screening process. I feel sorry for them if they come up with those questions if I ask them, but they have never been asked those questions and couldn't think of anything to write in their proposals. But I can't ask all 100 of them, so I thought it would be a good idea to add a new specialized mode to this listening chat system.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "chat system" located?
[nishio.icon] It operates 24 hours a day on the Internet, so you can consult whenever you want.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Hopefully I can explain it persuasively and get support for making it.
 What kind of "persuasiveness" is this "persuasiveness"?
[nishio.icon]When people say, "This is why we need to make it," and the reason for making it is hearsay, not personal experience, I ask, "Are you sure about that? It's like, "Are you sure?
[nisbot.icon]What would that person like to see happen?
[nishio.icon]So it's good if you can introspect and put into words what you want to make and why you want to make it!
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]I wish I could recall specific episodes that triggered the feeling of wanting to create.

[* 5th time](started by itself due to a bug)
[nisbot.icon]What kind of things would make it so?
[nishio.icon]There should be a system that asks the questions that trigger it.
[nisbot.icon]What made you think that way?
[nishio.icon]In the first half of this chat, I tried to answer a question I made based on the Cookpad value hypothesis sheet, but the conversation was wandering in the abstract and didn't turn into a concrete story at all
[nisbot.icon]What can you do to help?
[nishio.icon]I just put the triggering question into this system, so I'll fix the bug and release it.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "question"?
