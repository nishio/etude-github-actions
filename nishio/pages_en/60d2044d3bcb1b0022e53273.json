The 54th Meeting of Young Scientists in Information Science

invited lecture
Inverted Lecture Experiment: "Designing Learning Methods - Increasing Options for Problem Solving"

Hello, my name is Nishio. I have attended several meetings of the Young Scientists in Information Science since I was in my early 20s, and I miss it.
That is why I accepted the invitation to give a lecture this time, but to be honest, I don't think that just speaking one-sidedly in an online lecture will be of much value to everyone. Since the participants are highly IT literate, I would like to explore ways to create a better experience by making better use of IT.
Therefore, we will share the lecture portion as a video in advance so that everyone can watch it at any time and at any playback speed they like. This is an application of the "flipped classroom" method.
You can watch the lectures and write your questions in Scrapbox whenever you want. We designed the system to be loosely coupled, so that listening to a lecture and writing questions do not need to be synchronous.
On the day of the event, focus on what you can only do synchronously. We plan to proceed interactively with the moderator in the form of a panel discussion, rather than a one-sided lecture.

The lecture video to be shared in advance will be the one I gave as an alumnus at Nada High School in June 2021. The lecture materials are

The information has already been published at
I am also aware that there is a need for questions about my book "The Intellectual Production of Engineers" and I will create a page for that in Scrapbox.

Speaker: Mr. Yasukazu Nishio
D. in 2006 at the age of 24; since 2007 at Cybozu Labs, researching software for teamwork and intellectual productivity, up to now; published "The Technology Behind Coding" in 2013 and "The Intellectual Production of Engineers" in 2018; M.S. in Technology Management in 2014; since 2015. He is also a member of the board of directors of Mito, a general incorporated association. since 2018, he is also a specified associate professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

 I edited the video and put it up.



7/18
Scrapbox is prepared.
　I prepared [what I want you to do first].

6/23
　Can we have a flipped lecture like [Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference]?
　The "style of collecting questions in slido in advance" that we did in [Nada School Saturday Lecture 2021] was difficult to do because slido could only be open for one week.
　　We shared materials in advance and opened the slido 6 days in advance, but did not get any questions.
　　This is, well, not "the main program where the lecture is provided in video first, only the questions", so I guess the main behavior was to listen to the lecture and then ask questions according to customary practice.

How to solve this problem
	>When there is a demand for information and a supply of information, the demand side tends to place itself in a lower position than the supply side because it is the one that seeks information, which implicitly creates an authority gradient.
 > However, if the demand side plays the role of "information receiver" and the supply side plays the role of "information provider," the information in the room will be dominated by the supply side, and chemical reactions will not occur. chemical reactions will not take place. At this time, the demand side cannot take actions to improve the state of the field due to the authority gradient.
 > I guess to improve the situation in the market, people on the supply side should have restrained supply or extracted information on demand.

　Invited lectures, of course, are all over the [authority gradient].
　Maintaining a question-and-answer format contributes to the collection of information on the demand side, but the problem of talking too much
　　Keep a timekeeper?
　How can we reduce the [authority gradient]?
	→Æ Use a panel discussion style to create a "dialogue" format rather than a "one-way talk" format.
