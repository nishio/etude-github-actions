(3.3) Memory becomes strong by repeated use
We learned that memory and [muscle] are similar. Then, what is the difference? In memory, there is a phase of "[memorization]" that inputs information and a phase of "[recall]" that outputs information. Something different happens in these two phases, such as the occurrence of a [theta wave] of 4 to 12 Hz in the hippocampus only in the phase of the memorization.

When thinking about repeating something for memory, people tend to imagine repeating input, but both are necessary. 

When similar information repeatedly enters the brain, the brain gets slower and duller and finally ignores the information. *15

This mechanism is for ignoring useless information. It is similar to getting bored if you repeat similar tasks. *16

What is "useful" information for the brain? That related to [reward]. If you do not get rewards such as achievement, pleasure, or joy, your brain behaves as if that information is useless and ignores them.


Repetition of input only tends to be boring. It is necessary to repeat including the output. And it is even better if you earn rewards for the output.
