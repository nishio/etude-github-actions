Drucker's precognition
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1396756683100102657?s=46&t=oCBRrAjWlQU2VAtVYXTvoQ @nishio]: [Drucker] [abstracted] [facts] from [individual concrete] [facts] and [observed] them as [systems]. When [observed] as [systems], common [patterns] were found, and it was foreseen that they would be affected by [changes] that were already underway, and when [extensions] were translated into the original language, they were [unabashedly left out] even if they went against [common sense] at the time, which [after the fact] seems [prescient

relevance
	[future that has already happened].
	[systems thinking].
		[time delayed].
