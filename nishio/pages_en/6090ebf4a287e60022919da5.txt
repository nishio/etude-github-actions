 - I wish I could Reblog someone else's picture and add to it.
 - I thought for a moment about making a bookmarklet to convert it into a comic strip.
 - I want to use something like YahooWidget, which overlays and makes mouse events transparent, to trace over the image.
 
 *1197622280* For now.
 I did a demo at work now that I have a working applet that takes a screenshot of the screen and sends it to the server, which then serves it while going to paste the URL into Lingr.
 The idea is to let Ustream handle the audio and the atmosphere and use it for the presentation screen.
 
 I'll sort it out next week and put it up on CodeRepos.
