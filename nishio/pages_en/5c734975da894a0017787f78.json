Putting the obvious into words
Putting the "obvious" into words.
	[The natural is the hypothetical.]
	It is only a hypothesis that "It's obvious, so it must be understood without saying so.
		When you have a group of people who only think alike, you will have misunderstandings that you don't have to say.
		People think in many different ways, so you have to say what you think to get your ideas across.
	By daring to write about things that you think are so obvious that they don't need to be written about, you will notice omissions in your [understanding].
		[I dare to write the obvious.]
		The output of writing validates one's understanding.
		Writing enables [critical thinking] about what is written.
		When you write it down and think about it critically, you realize after the fact that it wasn't as obvious as you thought it was.
	[Normal is subjective.]
		Suppose someone says, in response to a sentence, "It's obvious.
			It was just "a concept that was already familiar to that person.
			It means there's a high degree of consistency between the person's experience and that statement, so objectively speaking, it's positive.
		On the other hand, if I'm supposed to think X about something, why am I going against it!" and get angry.
			Observed facts suggest "not the norm."
			It's only subjectively considered "natural".

conversely
	Bias to be "bizarre" by "trying to write something that is not the norm."
