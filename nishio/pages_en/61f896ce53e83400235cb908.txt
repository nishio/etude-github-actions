Place the book's table of contents in Scrapbox
 Book Table of Contents on Scrapbox, I started making a few by hand to try it out and instantly hated it.
 　Create a UserScript that converts a bidirectional link to a one-way link?
 　[Contents reading]Do it often[/villagepump/takker.icon][/villagepump/erniogi.icon].
 　 [/motoso/contents reading].
 　I think this is a situation where there is only a "path" and the actual content is in the book and cannot be placed in Scrapbox because of copyright[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　　They're taking advantage of the "discovery" effect of connecting roads.
 　　On the other hand, what I'm trying to do now is to present a table of contents to the reader based on the assumption that all the content is on Scrapbox.
　 There is certainly a difference between capturing only the content induction path and capturing the entire content[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 The concept of "link" in Scrapbox, if you ask 100 people who have no experience with Scrapbox, more than 90 of them will think it's a one-way link.
 So in that sense, Scrapbox is an "easy to create two-way links" system.
 　It's hard to represent bidirectional links in a tool that is primarily one-way links, so it's not going to get done.
 [Japanese translation of Scrapbox Reader https://scrapbox--reader--nishio-vercel-app.translate.goog/nishio/(6.2.4)_Parable,_metaphor,_analogy?_x_tr_sl=en &_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp]
		I'm using Scrapbox Reader to display the human translation of "The Art of Intellectual Production by Engineers" in Scrapbox, and then using Google Translate to convert it into Japanese.
		　The logic is that publishers complain when the content of a book is put directly on the Web, but they cannot prohibit users from reading machine-translated English content.
　　I have Vercel configured to return responses without blocking, so "loading" appears in the translation results.
　　I wonder if CSS can do something about the blank lines being skipped.
　　Did I follow the link and it's /en instead of /nishio? Needs to be debugged

　　2I fixed the title of the translated page with Pomodoro and it says "Already exists."
　　　There was already a translation!
　　I want an app that will help me get over the heartbreak of translating 4 more pages, great, I want an app that will give me positive penguin praise!
　　　Erai[/villagepump/kimoto.icon][/villagepump/takker.icon].
　　　Maybe we can create something like [Kyle][/villagepump/takker.icon].
　　But a page that has two different translations, I don't dare throw one away, so the need for a merge was born [negative workload]...
