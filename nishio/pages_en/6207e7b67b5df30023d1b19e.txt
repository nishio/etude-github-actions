[It is a mistake to perceive it as a set.]
　Looking at diversity groups from a unifier's point of view
　　When we recognize that it's a set of humans, it appears to me that the set is fragmented and the "people in it" are getting smaller and smaller.
　Looking at Unificationists from a Diversity Perspective
　　"A set of points in different positions."
　　It appears to me that we should limit its "location" and stop it within a narrow range, ultimately converging on a single point.

I thought it was going to be [a series of pictures of two people saying different things], but I couldn't draw it well.

Is it better to have a unified character code that differs from country to country?
Should one browser have most of the market share?
Can we let one social network grab the market share and decide what to filter?
etc
