communication distance
[https://gyazo.com/58911912576b2d02c051a0b18d52c416]
	[Knowledge overlap] facilitates [communication
  [Overlap]100% = 100% of what is said is interpreted as intended.
  0% overlap = 0% of words uttered are interpreted as intended
  For example, if 50% is interpreted as intended, it takes 2 utterances to convey the content of 1
  It is natural to assume that the distance is the inverse of the overlap
	But [triangle inequality] does not hold for this distance
 	It is possible that the distance between Mr. A and Mr. C is longer than "the distance between Mr. A and Mr. B + the distance between Mr. B and Mr. C
 	Not "[distance]" in the mathematical sense.
		In such a space, it can happen that the distance mediated by B is closer than the direct distance between A and C.
  This reduction in distance can be economically valuable.

	If distance is better, should we all have overlapping knowledge?
 	If you only consider the efficiency of communication, you're right.
  Add to that the effect that economic value is created by "[the] search for the unknown," and a [trade-off] arises
