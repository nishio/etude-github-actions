The naming and packaging design are not great, but the product was good.
It is a stick with grooves carved into it about the thickness of a rolling pin, but the surface turns so there is no friction.

With a rolling pin, there is friction between the skin and the rolling pin, so force is consumed there. With a rolling pin, there is no friction between the skin and the rolling pin, so "moving the pressure position while applying pressure" can be done efficiently.
