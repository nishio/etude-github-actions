The sentence is being janked attacked.
Junking Attack is when a "useless card" (junk) is added to the deck in Dominion
 Harmful because it draws 5 cards and reduces the chance of a useful card coming when you make your hand.
　So it works as an attack.

I saw a case where the text contained so many useless words that it looked like a deck that had been jank attacked.
　But it didn't happen because someone else attacked it. You're putting junk words in there yourself.
