constructive
[Group work in which there are no non-constructive people is more efficient because each member shares roles and there is no split loss of work. (Constructive, because they are in the same place but split into independent work.)
If someone is not constructive, it is more efficient to do it alone.
By the way, constructiveness has nothing to do with how smart you are, and we don't need people who are clever little critics and can take the initiative without much learning.

Nishio Hirokazu How can we improve constructiveness?

Jun KUIKEI: Mostly, people who are not constructive are those who have a high "need for recognition," but have low ability in the areas in which they want to be recognized and do not make efforts in those areas, or those who are in an inappropriate position but do not want to be exposed as unworthy of that position, and have incentives to shortcut their way to prominence and delay their work. There are incentives to manipulate, and I think it's important to destroy those incentives.

Nishio Hirokazu Very specific! I'll make a note of it üìù.
