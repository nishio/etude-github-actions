>Experiments of reading while making reading notes and not writing the headings in the notebook beforehand showed that the number of pages of the original per page of reading notes dropped considerably. The experimental data when the headings were hit were 9.8, 9.0, and 9.6, compared to 6.4 when there were no headings.
>If you look at the table of contents in advance and write the headings in your reading notebook, your perspective is in the mode of reading at the granularity of the table of contents, whereas when you are actually reading the contents, your perspective is in the mode of reading in more detail, so you would describe them in more detail, I guess.

>As for the number of original pages per unit time, it is gradually dropping to 25.6, 15.0, 14.3, and 10.7, which is a bit too little data to say anything. The number of original pages per note and the number of original pages per unit time are happening at the same time: 2.6, 1.7, 1.5, 1.7 The number of note pages per unit time is 2.6, 1.7, 1.5, 1.7 If the faster first session is another factor, the speed of note writing remains the same. This could be interpreted as an increase in the level of detail.

>In addition, as for why the headings are not written, there is a possibility that it is "because I was not interested when I read the table of contents," which could be interpreted as the reason for the slowness, so to properly discuss the cause, a random range should be done without a table of contents. Considering the situation of "I read the table of contents and was not interested, but eventually became interested while reading and continued reading, and the cost is higher than elsewhere because I did not write the headings," is it correct to "write the headings even if you are not interested" for practical purposes?
