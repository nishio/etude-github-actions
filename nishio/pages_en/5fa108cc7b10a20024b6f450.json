　Thoughts.
　　In a naive way, think about how many ways you can fill the empty space for each way of repeating the compatibility and making 1 into K.
　　　This doesn't look like it will make it.
　　width 8 height 100
　　　Less than 2^7 lines per line.
　　　First, we should foolishly count up how many ways "i goes to j".
　　DP with "how many ways is 1 in line a in b?"
　　Read the K-th last.
　　Side note: I don't feel the need to do this since it's 8x8x100 in this case, but if it's larger. It's a power of the transition matrix, so it can be doubled.
　公式解説OK
　 The official explanation does not pre-calculate transition probabilities and does a full search, but that is still good enough.
　 You might have noticed that if you tried it with smaller values, you'd actually get a [Fibonacci sequence].
