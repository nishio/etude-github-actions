　Thoughts.
　　First, everything is set to A, then sort the "gain from changing to B" and "gain from changing to C" and take it from the largest to the smallest.
　　This is probably not good enough. Because there's a pattern of, "If we go with B, it's a loss, but if we go with C, it's a huge loss, so we have to go with B."
　Official Explanation
　　When there are two types, a greedy algorithm that sorts by difference and takes the larger one is valid, so I want to transform the problem and then return to
　　If you sort by B-A, A will never be to the left of B, because in that case, [exchange does not make it worse].
　　So if we draw a boundary, we can come down to two kinds of problems.
