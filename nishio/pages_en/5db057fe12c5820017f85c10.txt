Initially output without title
	When it is first output, it is expressed in "just the text without title" such as on Facebook.
		Then, inspired by it in some cases, the "next comment" will hang.
		After some time has passed, "[title]" will be created at the time it is reprinted in Scrapbox.
		[title not necessarily a summary].
		A title as simple as a summary can be given only if the content of the expression is simple.
		For the most part, it's impossible to give it a simple title because it's a jumble of things.

	I've been thinking a lot about adopting Scrapbox as a form of knowledge representation.
		but "title and text" is still too rich an expression.
		As I felt when I first started using Scrapbox, requiring titles raises the bar for output.
			Being able to Scrapbox has led to the following operational avoidance, but not essential
				Rename afterwards with "ah ah" or something in the title.
				Write the body of the text, then find two key phrases that seem important and connect them with "and".
				Canned titles for things that cannot be titled, such as "Thought Nodes YYYYY-mm-dd"

	Short sentences are still the basic format
		A tentative title for it is the date and time it was created.
		It is for human beings to give a title that is a summary
		For the program, anything goes as long as it's indexed.
			Creation date and time as unchanged ID
			Vector if you are willing to change
