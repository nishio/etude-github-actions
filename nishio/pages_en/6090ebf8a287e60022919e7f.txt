 *1216627100*return to Tokyo
 I came back.
 
 *1216650617*Domestic
 I'm looking into booking flights and such to attend the <a href='http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:6'>6th 1000 Speakers Conference</a> in Nagasaki. This is my first time booking a domestic flight.
 
 
 This time, I decided to take the Tokyo-Nagasaki-Osaka route in order to combine with my summer vacation, but then I could not use Rakuten Travel's ANA Raku-Pack. I can't use Rakuten Travel's ANA Raku-Pak, because the return destination has to be the same as the destination. Hmmm. I checked the transfer guide and it seems that coming back to Osaka is easier than coming back to Itami by plane, because there are fewer transfers if I take the Shinkansen from Hakata. 3 hours and 40 minutes is not much different from 4 hours and 40 minutes.
 
 
 I searched kokunaisen.com and made a reservation. I booked by credit card, and it seems that I can bring my credit card with me on the day of the flight. I have no idea where I should bring it, but it is Tokyo/Haneda (08:20) to Nagasaki (10:10). It's early in the morning. Oh, and it takes about an hour from here to Haneda Airport. Oh, it's hard work.
 
 
 I booked a room at Hotel Sunroute near Sasebo station.
 
 *1216658049*Before bed
 The trap of trying to do English before going to bed because studying before going to bed helps retention, and you are sleepy before bed so you don't feel motivated.
