Campfire-type organization
Compare the organization to a [campfire]. There are no clear boundaries in an organization. There is a clear center, and the distance is determined by each individual.

> We are having a [campfire] and Aono-san and I are dancing in the middle. Some people were watching and dancing together with us, others were not able to join the circle, and others were watching the fireworks at a distance.
> Whatever the situation, all we have to do is just keep dancing in the middle.
> If the vision is interesting, I think the circle of dancing will continue to expand. Interesting is the key point.
> Each person has his/her own distance to the vision
