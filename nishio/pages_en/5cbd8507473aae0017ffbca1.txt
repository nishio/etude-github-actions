Classification and Interest
Not interesting -> "Why isn't it interesting?" → Because it's classified?
	The KJ Method Abhors "Don't Classify Anyway with Abstract Concepts!" So, why not?
	Classify non-specifics and turn into two non-specifics.

Classification is not interesting (hypothetical)
	It's interesting to see the unexpected interpretations."
	Do you find the classification of the unexpected amusing?"
	Do Surprising Classifications Actually Exist?"

The theory that classification is not interesting.
	Just give them one axis under the sun and say, "There are two opposing concepts to think about on this axis.
	Two opposing concepts can be created by providing the appropriate axes, so the existence of opposing concepts is self-evident and uninteresting.

It's fun to set up and categorize "axes of recklessness."
→ "Let's classify it on an absurd axis" "It's absurd" → "It's not funny.

Classification is "the process of asking a question (=axis) about an event and dividing it into three categories: "Yes," "No," or "Can't say either.
	Classification consists of two steps: "Create a question" and "Answer the question".
	It's not that classification is boring, it's boring because classification is a task.
	The "potentially interesting classifications" are the ones that cause me trouble when separating them.
		Interesting answer after a good stutter of a question that generates a stutter.
→[There is a question behind the classification].
