Hmmm, this probably doesn't understand my rough instructions as "instructions for the placement of the cat", but something like "it's kind of a mess and this area is black".

 Maybe "black cats" is not enough of a cat element.
 Do you want to try to specify more poses or something?
  If you have two of them, you could specify that too.
 And smudge? I don't think it should be a pen, just the hardest one you can find.

Redrawn!

(I'm changing several conditions at the same time.) I set the image size to 512.
　I saw that [Stable Diffusion's image size impact] is huge.

That's good!

I'm going to revise the rough draft because it didn't convey the intent a bit.

Er, why. You're making a lot of assumptions, W.

Let's change the seed and reroll in such a case.

The third one, I see. I changed the color of the cat's body to a ball or something, but the AI interpreted it as "the light blue thing by the cat must be a fish". That's good. I'll add "fish" to the prompt.

Try again with this image prompt of 512, which I thought was "worse" last time.
[https://gyazo.com/dbd1dfc892b0810d1de6a8c4303f4bf6]

Much better results than last time.
It appears that the problem is caused by the small image size, not the fill of the image or the fullness of the prompts.

Experiment with changing the prompt for img2img
We were talking about putting in the input on the left and getting the output on the right, and I said, "You specified the cat, didn't you?" He asked.
　To be precise, in addition to the image, we specify the prompt "black cat", a random seed, and a value for how much of the text and image should be mixed together
