  Goods that are not scarce (e.g., air) do not have a price. Non-economic goods
  Only those goods for which demand is less than supply are economic goods and subject to economics.

	general equilibrium
 	Because of diminishing marginal utility, the marginal utility of a person with many goods is lower than the marginal utility of a person with no goods, so a transaction that increases each other's utility is established.

	What determines the price?
 	[Adam Smith] and [Rickard].
