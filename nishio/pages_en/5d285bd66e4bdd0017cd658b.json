Bug that breaks if you zoom out as far as you can.
from [pRegroup2020]
Bug that is fine when zoomed out somewhat on the iPad, but breaks when zoomed out drastically.

	This is another violation of SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
  There is a discrepancy between the zoom value that Paper has and the zoom value that React has.
  This is a case where zoom needs to be changed directly without React state update for smooth zooming.

	A minimum value was set for ZOOM to prevent it from becoming too small when turning the wheel or doing a two-finger gesture on the PC version.
	The PC version updates React with the Paper value in setTimeout 500msec after the wheel event occurs, so the values remain consistent.
	On the other hand, the iPad version updates both Paper and React by itself at the end of the two-finger gesture.
		At this time, the "minimum value" is applied only to Paper updates, and a different value is set
		There is a pathway where the ZOOM value becomes NaN when further changes are made in that situation.

	It's rather ugly, but I managed to get away with inserting a similar minimum value process where the React update takes place.
	We'll fix this together when we clean up and redo the state transition area after the CCSE.

	Essentially, the maximum and minimum value processing should be determined based on the device information
