I want to destroy flesh and blood.
I think it would be easier to get people to agree if I said I want to destroy the anachronistic "handwrite your resume" and "do your math in handwriting," but if I generalize a bit and say I want to destroy [flesh and blood] people, I'm sure I'll get flamed for it.

But isn't it essentially the same thing?

If you think about why the flames happen, they would [take the words "I want to destroy [flesh and blood]" as an attack on them and rebel emotionally].

Where does this belief that "I am flesh and blood" come from?
