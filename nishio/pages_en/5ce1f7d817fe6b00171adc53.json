This is because the default configuration works as follows.
	execute a program
	→ Display the result in read-only mode

The following two-way exchange is required to run the "program that receives input.
	Receive user keystrokes → input to program
	Program output → display on screen for users to see

This program that receives the user's keystrokes and displays them on the screen is often called a "terminal.

You may see words like stdin, stdout, etc. in your programs.
