moral ethics
　Assumption that if you act according to virtue, you will be happy.
　Socrates: "I have said that it is important to follow justice, and it is against justice for me to break out of prison, and I would not be happy to survive it, so I die."
　Each person's "happiness" is different.
　Is fraud a good thing if someone thinks, "It is righteous to cheat the stupid rich out of their money and then distribute it to poor children?"
　　It's assumed that each individual is an autonomous, rational being, so this is going to be "good" for him or her.
　Anscombe, "Obligation theory and utilitarianism are action-centered and not good; virtue ethics is actor-centered."
　Obligations and utilitarianism only provide norms, not motivate people to them.
　If virtues were diverse, society wouldn't work.
　　[communitarianism] McIntyre.
　　　I can only answer "What should I do?" if I can answer "In what story will I find my part?"
　　Obligationalism and utilitarianism have abandoned the individual, so they cannot express the "role of the individual."
　　　There is information that has been left out as a result of ethics' attempts to define the universal good.
