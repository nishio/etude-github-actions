Knowledge growth curve is a faulty model
	[knowledge growth curve].
		It is not clear what exactly the vertical axis is.
	I'm beginning to think it's a false mental model.
	This kind of thinking makes the implicit assumption that "knowledge" corresponds to a one-dimensional value.
		There is an implicit assumption as if only "knowledge in a particular field" can be isolated and measured in one dimensional values.
	The value of knowledge is not determined by knowledge alone.
		[Value is determined by the receiver, not the sender.]
	Obviously, there's something wrong when you think of the vertical axis as value.
	What exactly is the vertical axis?

What is the relationship with [the principle that the learning curve is an S-curve]?
