Maximize the sum ratio
Let S be K positive sequences Ai, Bi of length N. We want to maximize the [ratio] of the sums of each of AB

[$ \argmax_S { \sum_{i\in S} B_i \over \sum_{i\in S} A_i }]

Instead of directly maximizing the ratio of sums, there is a solution method that makes it a problem of determining whether the ratio of sums is greater than or equal to X, and then bisectively searching for X
	[$ {\sum B_i \over \sum A_i} \ge X] 
	[$ \sum B_i \ge X \sum A_i] 
	[$ \sum B_i - X \sum A_i \ge 0] 
	[$ \sum (B_i - X A_i) \ge 0] 
If there exists an S satisfying the condition, then the K selections from which [$ B_i - X A_i] is larger satisfy the condition.
Therefore, this decision problem can be solved by O(NlogN).

If we [binary search] this X, we can find the largest X for which S satisfies the condition. This is the maximum value of X.
