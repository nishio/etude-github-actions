walking meditation
	There's an assumption that the word [meditation] means sitting.
 I think this is because of the famous meditation called zazen, and I think it's being dragged down.
 But there are a few religions that incorporate walking into their meditations.
 	It is called a sutra line (kinhin). https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/経行
 Walking is also a rhythmic exercise of the muscles, which stimulates serotonin secretion and helps maintain a meditative state
