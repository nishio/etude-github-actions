　Thoughts.
　　I wondered at first what the fourth of the candidate friend conditions was all about, but in essence it just says "it's a consolidation."
　　But asking for the consolidated component first could result in "all consolidated".
　　The vertex is 10^5, so it can't be on the order of squared.
　　You take advantage of the fact that the number of sides is limited to 10^5.
　　First, the connected components are found by [UnionFind] and initialized with size -1, and then, for each friend and block relationship, if both ends of the connected components are the same, the ends are set to -1.
