People who pretend to have
	There is person A who pretends to have X when he really doesn't.
	Person B, who does not have X, cannot identify whether A really has X or not

For example.
	Some people don't know much about cryptocurrencies but pretend they do.
	Some people pretend to be rich when they don't have money.
	Some people pretend to be smart when they are not.
	Some people pretend to be popular when they are not.

	Socially harmful because when people who don't understand X want to understand X, they are confused if they listen to "people who don't understand X but pretend they do"
	In some cases, you may not even realize that you don't really have X.
		Mr. A says something random, "X is YYYY," and the serious Mr. B takes it seriously and believes it, saying, "I see, X is YYY, and Mr. A, who knows a lot about it, told me so, so he must be right.
	As for knowledge, we should adhere to the principle that "[knowledge must be verified by practice].
