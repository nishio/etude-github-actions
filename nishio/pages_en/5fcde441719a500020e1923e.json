[D - Binomial Coefficient is Fun https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc110/tasks/arc110_d]
 Thoughts.
 　With N=2000, O(N^2) would be fine.
 　With M=10^9, it seems impossible to do dynamic programming like "the first one is x and the rest are M-x".
 　View [hockey-stick identity] → not true
 　If B is smaller than A, it is zero and can be ignored.
 　Distribute the remaining [$ R = M - \sum A_i] among 2000 boxes
　　Since there are about [$ \binom{2000 + R}{R} ] of individual events, they cannot be calculated individually and added together in time.
　　　→ should be able to be bundled and calculated by some formula transformation.
　　View [binomial coefficient formula
		[Vandermonde's identity]
		[$ \sum_{i=0}^k \binom{n}{i}\binom{m}{k - i} = \binom{n+m}{k} ]
　　　It's a product of binomial coefficients into a single binomial coefficient, which is close to the objective.
　　　Adding a lower value is also close to the objective of being constant
　　　Cannot be used directly because the value above changes.
　　　There must be a formula like a variant of this -> let's find it.
　　Write a code to naively calculate [$ f(A,B,K) = \sum_i \binom{A + i}{i}\binom{B + K - i}{K - i} ] that you want to get and observe
　　	table::
　　	 1	1	1	4	4C1
　　	 1	1	2	10	5C2
　　	 1	1	3	20	6C3
			→[$ f(A,B,K) = \binom{A + B + K + 1}{K} ]
		In the case of Section 3.
 		[$ \sum_{ij} \binom{A_1 + i}{i} \binom{A_2 + j}{j} \binom{A_3 + (R - i - j))}{R - i - j}]
 		[$ = \sum_{i+j} \binom{A_1 + A_2 + (i+j) + 1 }{i+j} \binom{A_3 + (R - (i + j)))}{R - (i + j)}]
 		[$ = \sum_{k} \binom{A_1 + A_2 + k + 1 }{k} \binom{A_3 + (R - k))}{R - k}]
 		[$ = \binom{A_1 + A_2 + 1 + A_3 + R + 1}{R}]
 	generally
		[$ \sum A_i + (N - 1) (1 + R)]
		　This is a mistake see addendum A
　　Calculating sample 1 with this formula gave 8, but I doubt it because of the messy calculations along the way.
　　　I'm supposed to have to come up with all the patterns below R, and I'm using the formula R=1.
　　In the first place, R can be about 10^9, so it seems impossible to calculate the binomial coefficient?
　This is a mistake see addendum B

　Official Explanation
　　[$ S = \sum A_i ] as [$ \binom{N+M}{S+N} ] is the answer
　　Since R=M-S [$ \binom{N+M}{S+N} = \binom{N+M}{N+M-R} = \binom{N+M}{R} ]
　　Why does this happen?
　　　The official explanation in natural language is, in essence, the following formula
			[$ \sum_i \binom{i}{A}\binom{N-i-1}{B} = \binom{N}{A+B+1} ]

　　Postscript B
　　 Calculation of binomial coefficients
　　　I tend to do "create a binomial coefficient table for faster calculation".
　　　 I made a library...
　　　But when the upper binomial coefficient is 10^9 and the lower is 10^6, as in this case, we should have used [$ C(n,m) = P(n,m) (m!)^{-1}].
　　　 This calculation can be done for O(m), so
　　　 Faster than creating a table of size n
　　　 [binomial coefficient for huge n].

　　Postscript A
	 	generally
			[$ \sum A_i + (N - 1) (1 + R)]
			　This is an error.
 　[$ X= \sum A_i + (N - 1) + R] is correct
 　　[$ R = M - \sum A_i] so [$ X = M + N - 1]
 　　Oh, that one doesn't fit...
 　　This formula only calculates the case where the "value to be assigned" is exactly R
 　　The value we want is [$ \sum_{r=0}^R \binom{S + N + r - 1}{r} ]
				Using the [field hockey stick identity
    [$ \sum_{i=0}^k \binom{n+i}{i} = \binom{n+k+1}{k} ]
   This increases by 1, and the value we seek is [$ \binom{S + N + R }{R} ].
   [$ \binom{S + N + R }{R} = \binom{S + N + R }{S + N} = \binom{N + M}{S + N} ]
   Now we come down to the same formula as in the official explanation.
　→ Explanation AC

　It can also be solved by attributing to a [formal power series].

　[OEIS]
　 https://twitter.com/yuruhiya/status/1335222719160315904?s=21
　　This time I was judging it by the naked eye, but when I was done, I used OEIS and it was a breeze, so I'll do that next time.

	A path that does not involve "predicting general terms from experimentally constructed sequences."
		If I interpreted it as [convolution of duplicate combinations], I could transform the expression in a straightforward manner.
