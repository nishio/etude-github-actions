Is the "Japanese language model" real?
	The idea that there is one "Japanese language model" for various Japanese sentences.
 I question this notion.
 Different people have different language models.
 	[Vocabulary varies from person to person.]
 Books also have different language models.
 Some models are close, some are far away.
 Easier to understand if the model is close

	A worldview where there is not one huge language model, but several language models talking to each other
