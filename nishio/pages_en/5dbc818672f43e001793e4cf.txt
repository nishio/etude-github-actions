Quality and Speed
[https://gyazo.com/b31dcec5e13516e81b1b5e216d81a037]
	Quality and speed are a trade-off" is a big misconception.
	Internal quality is sacrificed in the name of "quality", especially "maintainability" ("ease of testing", "ease of understanding", "ease of change")
	In fact, increasing conservatism will increase speed and decreasing conservatism will decrease speed.
	Reducing speed will not improve maintainability, and longer lead times will not allow for the hypothesis testing process.
	The break-even point for investment in internal quality comes surprisingly quickly (within a month).
