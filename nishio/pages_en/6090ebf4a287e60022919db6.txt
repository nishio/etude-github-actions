 *1199081029* I just remembered something on Alan Kay.
 Searching for something like "how to import privately"...
 
 *1199092300*How to buy items domestically that do not ship outside the US.
 I am grateful to those who have come before me in everything.
 I had wandered around UPS, USPS, eBay, etc. a lot with Kansuke Yamamoto's life on the side, but when I blurted it out on Skype in 1981, I was told about this service.

  Store or seller will not ship to Japan.
 If you are able to pay by yourself and the seller or store only ships within the U.S., BidBuy will receive your items in the U.S. You can use BidBuy's U.S. address instead of a P.O. Box.

 Here it is!
 
 *1199096018*I don't understand paypal
 -I put a Japanese address in the BillingAddress field and now I can't put a US address in the ShippingAddress field.
 -I put in a US address and it told me to put in the correct combination of City, State and ZIP Code....orz
 -I put in the correct combination and now it says "this credit card is not accepted" orz.
 
 Why is it VISA? Why not Rakuten KC card?
 
 *1199097460*I was going to buy OLPC.
 I got sick of it because it was too much trouble.
 
 *1199098832* New Year's Eve.
 I wonder what will happen next year...
 I wonder if I can really make breakthroughs.
 Or maybe I should just give up and go support someone who is about to make a breakthrough.
 
 *1199103095* Let's take a look at something called Kohaku.
 The number of Morning Musume is increasing! I thought it was AKIBA24 or something like that. No wonder there were so many of them...they were hoping that if they threw 24 pitches, at least one of them would enter the strike zone?
 There was a guy who sang a song like Sada Masashi like Sada Masashi. I forget his name, but he had seven letters in hiragana.
 
 I checked the program list now, and it was wrong: it was AKB48. And the first group of people I thought were AKB48 were Morning Musume。 ＋How many people are there? How many people are there in total?
 
 Well, my human observation skills, which are notorious for not being able to distinguish between Aya Ueto and Miki Ando, recognized that "someone different from Ayaka Hirahara is covering Jupiter". It turns out that I don't equate everything with everything! (Isn't that worse than that?)
 
 Ayaka Hirahara

 Hmmm...I can still see how the first and third pictures are the same person (if the first one is from when he was 20 and the third one is from when he was 30 or something).
 But the second one is not a different person... No matter how you look at it, it looks like a different person...
 
 After comparing them over and over again, I figured it out! I knew it was the same person! (What the hell is wrong with my eyes that just because the camera is facing the wrong way, they think it's a different person!)
 
 ZARD had never been in Kohaku?
 
 A marvelous electrical parade.
 Human parabolic antenna.
 
 Furyinkazan is famous, but the catch copy of Uesugi's side is not so well known. The credit goes to the feet" is a good phrase.
 
 Ayaka Hirahara, I looked her up on Wikipedia and found out she is 23 years old. I thought she was older.
 
 Aiko is indeed older than me. I checked to see if they might be about the same age, but they are 6 years older than me. You can't tell a woman's age at all from her appearance. So please don't say "How old do I look?

 It's a voice only a woman can hear.
 
 *1199109135*MyISAM
 My courage (no.
 
 I wrote the org how to write it in SQLite, but when I installed MediaWiki, I needed to use MySQL. I'm still learning the difference between MyISAM and InnoDB. I'm still learning the difference between MyISAM and InnoDB.................
 
 By the way, you should profile the coverage ranking properly once it's been so heavy lately.  ...or there is another bottleneck in the cache that you thought you were caching heavy processing.... Whatever it is, I guess we should observe it first....
 
 *1199116298* Ah,
 I realized that the year had changed.
 
 We look forward to working with you again this year.
 
 
 KY for short.
 
 *1199117294* Home-built instrument making workshop

 Oooh. That's an interesting thing you're doing.
 I thought the world is a small place when Uda-kun and others were mentioned, even though they were hung up on the antenna of how to write org.
