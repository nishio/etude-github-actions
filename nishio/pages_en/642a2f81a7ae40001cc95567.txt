I have no idea what will be required of me in the future. Considering the continuing decline in the working population and the tightness of social security funds, as long as I stay healthy, I can be of service to others, can't I?

>[nobi https://twitter.com/nobi/status/1642683806393196549] This is exactly what I'm talking about. The reskilling that was talked about last year was a rush to teach skills that may not be needed in the AI age.

> From now on, I believe that what is important is to discover by oneself what only human beings can do, human power, and what one thinks is "interesting" and to pursue it and instruct AI to do so.
