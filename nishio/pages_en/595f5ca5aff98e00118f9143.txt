Lagrange's mean value theorem
[$ \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}=f'(c) ]

	Two real numbers [$ a < b]
 Function [$ f(x)].
  Continuous on closed interval [$ [a, b]]
  Differentiable on open interval [$ (a, b)
 In this case, there exists a point [$ c] on the open interval [$ (a, b)] and the following holds
 [$ \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}=f'(c) ]
 This is called Lagrange's mean value theorem for derivatives.
 As a separate expression, there exists a [$ 0 < \theta < 1
 [$ f(a + h) = f(a) + h f'(a + \theta h)]
  Only the following rewrite is done [$ b = a + h, c = a + \theta h].

By Lagrange's mean value theorem [$ \log(1 + x) = \frac{x}{1 + \theta x} ]
	because
 [$ a = 1, h = x] as
 [$ \log(1+x) = \log(1) + x \log'(1 + \theta x)]
 [$ \log'(x) = 1/x, \log(1) = 0], so
 [$ \log(1 + x) = \frac{x}{1 + \theta x} ]
	Since log(x) is not differentiable at x=0, the absolute value of x must be less than 1
