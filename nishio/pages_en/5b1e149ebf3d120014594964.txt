Testing Speech Recognition
Test to see if voice recognition works even when it's open when it's not.
It seems to work even if different tabs are open, so I'll test opening the same page from multiple pages smartly.
If you can do that, you should be able to watch it on the Oculus while applying voice input on the PC at hand anyway, at least if you can do it from your phone or something.
I think it would be a little difficult to move or delete lines that contain anything, but if you could move them up or down, I'd say that would be much better.
I don't see you in there right now.
They're on the move.

Maybe the mon goes off on its own after a while.
 I'm regretting the G 6 or whatever it was that came out, but at any rate, if you speak the language and then police the article recording, it would be easier for me to revise it and make the minutes.
So I think it would be interesting to take some pictures of that.
It's time for a meeting.
If you don't put a microphone in place that captures the voice of the person in front of you, it's like an uncle who wants to stop all your voices and leave his own to the chiropractors.

I wonder if the input is not made until the end of the speech....................................................

Well, if you use this, you can take some writing courses and type with your hands, but there is that thing about the size of the voice input button having to be long.

I'm wondering if it's possible to leave the voice input end button on all the time and then be taken out of the bath at the appropriate interval. I took it, but as soon as it was over, I had to leave it at 2 o'clock.

I'm not sure if it's because I'm a bit of an idiot or if it's because I'm a bit of an idiot, but I think it's because I'm a bit of an idiot, and I think it's because I'm a bit of an idiot. I wonder if he will practice and speak in an inaudible and unpleasant way.

I'm not good at voice input, but I'm not good at talking to an empty space, even if it's just a virtual presence. I'd like to make a 3D model of her, and I'd like her to be a little cuter, please, with eight lines and eight lines left.

 I'm sure there are at least three of them.

I have no desire to become some kind of virtual being, but I would like to make a cat, and I would be very happy if a program I wrote made a model that moved like a cat.
