		Minimum cost flow?
			This condition is difficult.
			>Takahashi-kun can pick up items in the squares he passes (including the start and goal). However, you can only pick up 3 items in the same row of squares. If there is an item in a square you pass, you may not pick up that item.
	Official Explanation
		r, c, plus "number of items picked up" DP in three dimensions
　A new thought.
　　Even when solving with [minimum cost flow], if you try to express "only 3 pieces can be picked up" in terms of graph vertices, it becomes 3 dimensional.
　　And it is computationally less expensive to solve with DP than to solve as least cost flow cost.
　　First, this is [the problem of maximizing the score of a pathway].
　　　And if there are no "up to 3", then the type of "score is obtained from only the last vertex of the pathway".
