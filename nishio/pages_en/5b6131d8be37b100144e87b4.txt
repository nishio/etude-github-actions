intellitech English Additional Columns
I thought it would be better to have a column in the English version of the column explaining the KJ method involving [Westerners who see the trees and Easterners who see the forest].
There are two types of thinking: thinking that categorizes by attribute and thinking that connects by association, and quantitative data show that the former is more common among Westerners and the latter among Orientals.
It supports the KJ method's "don't categorize, find the relevance" from a different angle.
