Company Boundaries and Personal Valuation
[https://gyazo.com/a9e97cb93742b2f78b9c91b67e9dc99f]
There is Mr. A, who works only within the company, and Mr. B, who straddles [organizational boundaries]. #Straddle the boundary
Assume that Mr. A and Mr. B use the same ability and the same effort in their activities.
If we [evaluate] only the "inside" activities of the company, Mr. A would have a higher evaluation.

In this "[only inside evaluation]", it is a loss for the individual to operate outside of the company.
	Therefore, the number of "inside-only activity" type employees like Mr. A will increase.
	As a result, in the long run, this company will be at a disadvantage because it will lose its connections to the outside world.
	ã€€For example, [knowledge acquisition costs] from outside the company will increase, making it harder to adapt to changes in the external world.

This is an example of [optimization for incorrect evaluation functions].
	To avoid this phenomenon, the form of evaluation needs to change.
	Outside activities are evaluated in the same way as inside activities, and finally "inside-only activities" and "[outside activities]" are evaluated equally.
	If the current culture has formed a majority of "inside-only activities" types, it is necessary to rather value "outside activities" more highly than "inside activities" in order to promote "outside activities" as well.

One way to mitigate the tendency to underestimate the value of "outside activities" when evaluated based on current internal values is to refer to "outside evaluations."
	The fact that [Cybozu] now takes [market valuation] into account can be interpreted as an example of this.
