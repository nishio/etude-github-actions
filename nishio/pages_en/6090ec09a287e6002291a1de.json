 >>> m[array(x)] # (Q2)
 array([[1, 2]])

 Q1 is passed as a list, so it is regarded as a list of ints (True == 1, False == 0), and the corresponding row is selected; Q2 is put in an array, so it is regarded as a bool array, and only the True row is selected; Q3 is put in a tuple, so it is regarded as accessed with the notation m[ 1, 0], and the 0th element of the first row is selected; Q4 is put in an array, so it is regarded as an array of bools, and only the True row is selected. 1, 0] and the 0th element of the 1st row is selected.
