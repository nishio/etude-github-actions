Tools for massaging the scalp

I have used several different types, but this is by far the easiest to wash and dry. Hygienic. The ones with hollow sections allow water to collect inside, and the ones with joints allow dirt to form on the joints. With this one, after using it to wash my head, I just rinse it with water and wipe it with a towel, and it is already clean. Since it is not wet, you can take it out to the living room and use it for a scalp massage.

I became interested in balicata, so I ordered more.
