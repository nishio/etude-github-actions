 *1228026498* 23 Wards of Tokyo
 Shinagawa → Meguro → Shibuya → Shinjuku → Toshima → Kita → Bunkyo → Sumida → Chuo → Chiyoda → Minato
 So far, 11 pieces. Let's see, what are the missing ones? Katsushika-ku, Ota-ku, Nerima-ku,...
 
 Scoring. Itabashi ward is located between Nerima and Kita wards. Adachi ward is located between Kita and Katsushika wards. And Edogawa, Koto, Suginami, Setagaya, etc. 11/23.
 
 
 
 Shinagawa station is not in Shinagawa-ku (Minato-ku), Meguro station is not in Meguro-ku (Shinagawa-ku)
 Setagaya Ward has Futakotamagawa. Ota Ward has Kamata. Suginami and Nakano wards have the Chuo Main Line running straight through them, with Mitaka Station in Mitaka City, Kichijoji Station in Musashino City, Ogikubo Station in Suginami City, Nakano in Nakano City, and Okubo and Shinjuku east of Higashinakano, turning sharply south.
 
 Toshimaen is not in Toshima-ku (Nerima-ku), and Itabashi Station is the only JR station in Itabashi-ku. The west exit is in Itabashi Ward, the east exit is in Kita Ward, and most of the platforms are in Toshima Ward. Komagome is on the border of Toshima-ku and Kita-ku, and Tabata is in Kita-ku. Bunkyo-ku has Todai and Korakuen. Nippori is in Arakawa Ward. Across the Arakawa River is Adachi Ward to the north. Adachi-ku has Kitasenju station. The station is on the Joban Line. Kameari in Katsushika-ku is also on the Joban Line. The nightingale station is in Taito Ward. Asakusa is also in Taito Ward. The east side of Taito-ku across the Sumida River is Sumida-ku. Kinshicho Station is in Koto-bashi, Sumida-ku. If you take the Sobu Main Line directly east to Koiwa, you will reach Edogawa Ward. By the time you get to the next Ichikawa station, you will cross the Ichikawa River. From Ichikawa to the end of the line is Ichikawa City. Even if you read it from the top, it is still Ichikawa City.
 
 Keiyo Road and Yotsume Dori intersect in front of Kinshicho. The Hanzomon Line runs under Yotsume-dori. This area is squared off like Manhattan. The station of Sumiyoshi, one block south, is in Koto-ku.
 
 To put it in perspective, west of Taito Ward is Sumida Ward, and the Sumida River lies between the two wards. The JR Sobu Line and the Kanda River run in an east-west direction to reach Akihabara. Akihabara Station is in Chiyoda Ward. Banze-bashi Bridge spans the Kanda River. The Kanda River does not pass in front of Kanda Station, but goes up to Ochanomizu, Suidobashi, Iidabashi, Edogawabashi, Mengeibashi, Nakano-Shinbashi, Takaido, Inokashira Park, and Inokashira Pond in Inokashira Park is the source of water. Incidentally, it is a first-class river.
 
 Let's go back to Asakusabashi. Asakusabashi is in Taito Ward and Akihabara is in Chiyoda Ward. Bakurocho, south of Asakusabashi, is in Chuo Ward. Bakuro" does not mean horse sashimi, but rather "a person who is engaged in the livestock business is sometimes called "bakuro (also written as "Hakuro" or "Hakuraku", and read as "Bakuro"). It is sometimes called "bakuro. (<a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%B6%E7%95%9C%E5%95%86'>Livestock dealer - Wikipedia</a>). There is also a Hakuromachi in Osaka.
 
 Shinbashi is in Minato Ward as expected. Shinagawa is also in Minato Ward. Well, the round trip of Yamanote Line is over. I will draw a picture later.

 I'm wondering if it would be against the law if I put in my blog profile section that I have never received a judge's notice and then erased it when I received it.

 <BODY>Seriously, I don't think that if you make a strong argument that you didn't write it, it will pass. Well, there may be a way to not stick to it because there should be no penalties. </body>

 <body>Even if you actually erased it after receiving it, you can claim that you erased it because you were "concerned about whether or not it would violate the law if I erased it after receiving it". </body>.

 <body>He says it's fine. ...... Well, I don't mind. In this case, I don't think there's enough merit on their side to pursue that alone so much. </body>
