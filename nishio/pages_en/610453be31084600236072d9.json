Point out the mistakes of the elderly.
I have a tendency to take the initiative to "point out the mistakes of older people" to myself, and I don't know why that is.

I don't know exactly what this is, but I'm wondering if it's like this?" I'll make a note of what I think it is.

傾向
　Especially prone to point out when "unfounded (or implicitly based on experience) claims of elders" are contrary to "objective evidence".
　Tend to point out opinions, even if those opinions are harmless to you

Let's say I refrained from pointing this out.
　Older people are not offended.
　I can avoid [interpersonal risk].
Selfishly, I would think that if an opinion is not harmful to me, there is no disadvantage to me in leaving it alone, and if I point it out, I take the risk, so I should not point it out, but for some reason I don't behave that way.

In other words, they subconsciously believe there is some kind of "harm" in it.
Perhaps it's a feeling of "not wanting the place to be defined as 'a place that prioritizes the comfort of elders over what is right'".

If that is the case, people younger than me will avoid pointing out my mistakes to me when I make them.
I personally don't like that, so you are actively creating an atmosphere of "it doesn't matter if the other person is older or not, claims that are contrary to the facts should be pointed out as false".

I can't think of an appropriate link as it is.

　When you "give insight" into the desires of troublesome people, they become more aggravated and even more difficult to handle.
