Consistent use of language
　Humans are stupid and are not good at using [words] in a [consistent] sense
　In areas such as [mathematics], the emphasis and training is on using words in a consistent sense.
　Programming uses a notation in which words have a one-to-one correspondence with their meanings because "it would be difficult for a computer to understand otherwise".
　One-to-one correspondence allows the use of a particular word to be changed to another word in bulk
　　Therefore, it is easy to change the wording after the fact while maintaining consistency.
　　It is common for programmers to use editors to assist with this type of work
　[Scrapbox] gives similar assistance to natural language by batch conversion of links
