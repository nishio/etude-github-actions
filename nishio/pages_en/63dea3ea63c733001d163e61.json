　1: There is a conflict between A and B
　2: A different cut C is made.
　[Dialectical Development]
　3:
　 At this time, "A and B [conflict]" in the original cut does not disappear
　 　So if you focus on that, it looks like "[the discussion] is not progressing as [parallel lines]".
　 We're going in a [different] direction.
　 　You can tell if it's [progressing] by whether it's creating [new ideas] that didn't exist before the conflict.
