Invest to lower [knowledge acquisition costs

I know it's a mismatch with the title, but we're talking about investing at a cost to lower the cost of knowledge acquisition.

	> Cybozu Labs' internal machine learning study group took place over an eight-month period starting in February 2011, and at the time of this writing, it has been three years since its completion. Looking back now, I realize that what I learned in this study group was used many times during the three years when reading books and papers other than PRML. It will be used for many years to come. Although the initial investment was very high, I feel that it was an investment property that will provide returns over a very long period of time.
