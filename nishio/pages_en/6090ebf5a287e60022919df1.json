 I had another nosebleed in the morning. Hmmm, what kind of state is my body in?

 >>
 The entire hemoglobin molecule has a molecular weight of about 64,000 and contains four heme

 So, the amount of Fe is about 224 since there is one Fe per heme. Surprisingly small.
 
 *1203919287* How to color in IRC
 I was watching a presentation at the 86th meeting yesterday, and I was talking on IRC about how to color the letters no.
 http://www.mirc.co.uk/help/color.txt
 When I pasted this and wrote "I heard that writing a number after ^C determines the color", many people wrote ^C directly orz ^C means "\x03" (><)
 
 There is no particular increase in the amount of information, but I've included the Japanese version.

 *1203933544* headache
 Why not?
 what's wrong with it?
 
 I ran it in Jython before and wrote about it again and it doesn't work orz
 Am I misunderstanding something because of my headache?

 <BODY>If it's just a nosebleed, you may just have a scratch in your nose that makes it bleed easily. If you are concerned about it, go see an ENT immediately. </body>
