Don't make a business out of what is not a business.

Don't make a business out of what is not a business.

Don't make it your business to do what is not your business.

Just as there are those who gossip about everything, there are those who make it their business. They always have a big mouth and take everything seriously, turning it into controversy and secrecy. Don't take trouble too seriously if you can avoid it. It's a terrible thing to take something too seriously when you have to look over your shoulder. It may be an easy solution in the beginning, but not afterwards. Often the cure causes the disease. This is by no means the most important rule of life: "leave things alone".
