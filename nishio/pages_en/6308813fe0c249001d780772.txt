The first one is interesting, although the one in the foreground doesn't have ears.
The second one has no fine writing, but it's cat-like.
The fourth is creepy.

The former is a rhythmic rectangular composition with a cat's face-like motif
The latter uses colorful colors and black lines of a certain thickness, while the shape of the lines expresses the cat's tail and body shape.
I think both are good solutions with some advantages.

[https://gyazo.com/2ac4197b2ccfc69ccbe3c8e6931a40da]
This is not good because the advantages are gone.

Overlaid with "Cats, cats and cats" to make cats stronger.
Compared to the previous three pictures, it looks like some kind of four-legged creature.

One CATS made one.

But personally, I think the first one looks the most like it.
From a distance, it looks like a group of lively cats frolicking...but when you zoom in, it's just tentacles connected to each other in a wiggly pattern.

This is a Paul Klee style painting of a scene called "Blue cat" that does not appear to exist in the photograph.

The second one, where did the cat go...
The third one, on the contrary, explicitly depicts a cat.
The first one "has a fragment painted on it that reminds me of a cat" is about as good as it gets.
The second one is pretty close in terms of the picture. the third one seems too blatant to me.
Wife: "Maybe there's a hand nuance here."
　[https://gyazo.com/0293ba09c13e53236b4d5d380ca7fc09]
　Wife: "The third one looks like it could be on the wall of a café or something, and if I had to give it a title, I'd say 'Music'."
　I said, "Well, I paint pictures of violins and other musical motifs."

Both the first and second pictures have an Asian feel to them.
The third one makes me wonder if it's Japanese, but I've outlined it so clearly that I don't feel like I know it at all.

I thought maybe the subject was too difficult, so I used a different keyword, but we seem to have roughly the same perception.

I was actually going for this style earlier, but the designation was vague.

No, that's too much influenced by Georges Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte.
