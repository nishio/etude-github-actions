Verify if replacing the Reconsiler stops the image blinking on the iPad.
from [pRegroup-done-2019]
Verified if it is possible to replace [Reconciler] to prevent images from blinking on iPad.
	I'm planning to do it because I think I can, but if I can't, there's no point in doing it.
	It is expensive to modify the entire large software to be error-free, so a small one is created and checked by extracting only the necessary parts.
	â†’Found that it doesn't blink.
