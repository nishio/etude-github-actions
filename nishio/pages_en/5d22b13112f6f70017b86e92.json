Use Case: Organizing conversation logs with bots

I found that I only used the chopped one, so I poured it into [Use Case Memo: Creating Presentation Materials from Scratch

-----
I did some more grouping, etc., but I was working offline and reloaded by mistake.
	[reload when editing offline so updates are not lost].

I ended up placing it with just the chopped one.

chopped (e.g. meat)
	If you pour through the chat logs, it's more interesting to see the long-winded replies than the brief ones.
	But if you put it on a sticky note as it is, the letters will be small and hard to read.
		Short, uninteresting responses that reply in short sentences stand out.
	Long sentences need to be chopped.
		Need support for carving
		Now I simply edit it myself as text and then import it: [inscribes on sticky note].
		It would be nice to chop on the system to keep reference to the original text and be able to see it in the detailed view of the sticky note
