 Rain is falling sideways.
 
 *1208478174* I hate going outside.
 But I don't think slacking off is going to change things, so I have no choice but to go.
 
 I mean, I think my umbrella is going to break when it's this windy.
 
 *1208486743*[gcc]初STL
 >|cpp|
 sort(a.begin(), a.end());
 iter_print(a.begin(), a.end());
 vector<int> buf(a.size(), 0);
 iter_print(buf.begin(), buf.end());
 adjacent_difference(a.begin(), a.end(), buf.begin());
 iter_print(buf.begin(), buf.end());
 
 return *min_element(buf.begin() + 1, buf.end());	
 ||<
 
 Oh, it's done, it's done.
 I'm starting to understand how to read STL error messages.
 
 *1208488502*[gcc]Defined only at hand
 However, if I define "main" to run the program on TopCoder, TopCoder will be angry when I try to compile the program on TopCoder because it is a duplicate definition. So I think it would be better to use #ifdef so that main is defined only at hand.
 
 - #ifdef LOCAL～#endifでmainを囲む
 - Compile with g++ -DLOCAL foo.cpp.
 
 This is OK.

 But as far as TopCoder is concerned, just use the template to do the following.

 I inadvertently went through the story of editing the template, but now the test cases will run locally. Super convenient.
 
 *1208497501* What I learned today
 - L4
 -- Transport layer (TCP, etc.)
 - L7
 -- Application layer
 - 全二重と半二重
 -- Full-duplex can be sent in both directions at the same time. Half-duplex can be sent in both directions, but not simultaneously.
 - Destruction spell ":(){ :|:& };:"
