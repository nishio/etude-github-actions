Updating iCloud Credit Card
I got this email.

>200 GB iCloud storage plan billing of $400 is scheduled to occur on 08/07/2019, however, there is an issue with your payment information and we have not been able to complete the billing process.
> Please update your payment information at your earliest convenience. Failure to renew will result in your account being downgraded to the free 5 GB storage plan.

But when I go to Settings -> iCloud on my iPhone, I don't see anything that says "your name".
I went to "iTunes Store and App Store" and tapped on the Apple ID view for details, then updated my credit card (since I'd probably need this anyway).
I wonder if the iCloud side is OK with this update.
