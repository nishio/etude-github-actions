Highway Parable
[nishio.icon]It is futile for people who drove before the highways were built to tell people who are going to drive after the highways are built that they need to train to drive on unimproved roads and not drive on them. The new people will be driving on the unmaintained roads after they finish driving on the freeway anyway, so they should just drive through the places where there are freeways.

	People who get grumpy when others get what they have worked hard to acquire with ease are detrimental to society and should not be allowed to go unchecked.
	Civilization progresses by "making things that are hard but worth doing less hard," so those who oppose it are the enemies of civilization.
 The word "highway" in the first tweet does not mean a physical highway, but "[a] highway of knowledge" and "a mechanism that facilitates knowledge acquisition," just to be clear.
 	>The highway of knowledge (chi no kosoku doro) is one of the learning theories [src https://www.weblio.jp/content/%E7%9F%A5%E3%81%AE%E9%] that [Zenji Hanyu] Meijin talked about in his 2006 bestseller [Mochio Umeda]'s book "[Web Evolution]" [src https://www.weblio.jp/content/%E7%9F%A5%E3%81%AE%E9% ab%98%e9%80%9f%e9%81%93%e8%b7%af]

	[nishio.icon]Oh, by "highway" I meant "the road that gets you to your destination faster", not "pay for a toll road you don't understand and follow the signs without knowing where you're going". Just to be clear.
	When there's a certain road, it may not be easy to determine if this is a highway that leads to a destination. Basically, the ones that have been repeatedly improved by many people are the better ones. A road that is frequently improved by many people is more likely to be a good road than a road with few people driving on it.

	It's a [nishio.icon] "It's difficult to make decisions on our own, so we should rely on [social proof]" kind of idea.

Highways are convenient for veterans as well.
	[nishio.icon]I totally agree, and the veteran who uttered the words "It's outrageous to use the freeway" is cursed by his own words and doomed to never ride the freeway again and sink into the swamp [src https://twitter.com/nishio/status/ 1281172284204445696]

Some people are fascinated by the speed of the paved highway and find it unpleasant to drive slowly on mountain roads
