Unexplored Junior x English
I recorded this as an interesting sample of what the [unexplored junior] PMs are discussing.

	(PM Ukai) Unexplored Junior, we did not receive a single proposal in English this year, but in the future, it might be better to accept proposals only in English, as it would motivate people to study English? I think it would be better to accept proposals only in English in the future, as it would motivate people to study English.
		(Suzuki PM) I think it would be possible to introduce it next time, if only to have students write 30-50 words in English. Considering the state of English education in elementary and junior high schools in Japan, I think it is unfair to require all of them to write in English.
		(PM Ishii) As expected, I don't think English proficiency has anything to do with the unexplored nature of the project itself, but it is true that people with English proficiency have a larger number of users to reach, more people to ask, and a wider sense of future development potential. This is also true for Chinese.
		(PM Nishio) Accepting only English is "uniformly enforcing English" and undermines diversity, so it would be better if some PMs would just declare that they positively evaluate English applications.
			My personal feeling is, "It doesn't matter if the proposal is in Japanese or English, but Chinese is a problem for me because I cannot read it. If English speakers are included among the intended users, I will positively evaluate their high English proficiency. The same applies to Chinese.
