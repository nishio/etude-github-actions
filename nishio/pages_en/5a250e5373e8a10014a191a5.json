What it means to separate data
 Why separate data in [machine learning]?
 	Specific Practices
   10% of the total data is separated as "data not at hand" and the model is trained on the remaining 90% of the data. The performance of the model is measured by the percentage of correct answers that are obtained with the remaining 10% of the data.

 If you do it as a manner without knowing the reason, you feel like you don't have to do it.
 Perhaps it would be better to teach them to think in terms of what they want to achieve, rather than "this is the way it should be done as a matter of etiquette.
 What we want to achieve is good performance for "data not at hand".
 I can't know if it will perform well for "data I don't have at hand" because I don't have the data at hand.
 So we take some of the data and say, "Let's pretend that this is data that we don't have on hand now and that we will have in the future.
 Since you chose to "not have it on hand," of course you couldn't possibly use it during the study.
 You can physically use it, but if you understand the premise that "this is supposed to be data that you don't have on hand," you'll know you can't use it.
