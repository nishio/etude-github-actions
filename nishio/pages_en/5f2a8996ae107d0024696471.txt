Score calculation to take out only the maximal columns
[https://gyazo.com/7e76fe3268f150e9b8451b69efa249b1]
　When a series has a score of 0 or 1, if you consider the ranking of "the product of the scores for a subsequence", it includes all the subsequences of the interval that are 1.
　If you interpret the algorithm in [RAKE] to mean that the columns from which stopwords are removed are candidates for key phrases, with a score of 0 for stopwords and 1 for everything else, this approach is incorrect because it also includes sub-columns.
　If we consider that the outer scores of the subcolumns are multiplied by the score subtracted from 1, only the extreme columns will have a score of 1
　　This fits well with the concept of counting the number of times a key phrase appears adjacent to it in the [RAKE's stoplist generation] algorithm

 This, this, this, this, doesn't it all come down to [hidden Markov model]?
　　Hidden state is either 2 states of "being a keyword, not a keyword" or 4 states of "not a keyword, before a keyword, within a keyword, after a keyword".
　If it can be attributed to hidden Markov, then it can also be attributed to [conditional probability fields].
