 I feel like I need to do housework, but I'm not getting much done.
 - Dumping empty cans
 - Washing & Drying
 - Put some garbage into garbage bags.
 
 I do a lot of things when I list them. It's not tidy because the list is not complete. Like the floor is not out. I'm going to collect the papers that are on the floor and do something about it. I'm not sure if "do something" is vague enough. Find papers that have gone missing.
 
 
 I found a bunch of papers that had been voluntarily put away under my bed.
