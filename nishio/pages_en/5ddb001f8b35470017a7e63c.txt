Spring Models and Deep Learning
	[Spring model] is a system that updates (x, y) of the number of vertices
		The potential energy of the system is defined by the connectivity of the edges
		Differentiating that potential energy yields the force
		Update the position of a vertex with its force
	[Deep Learning] is a system that updates the weights W
		The error function is defined by the relationship between inputs and outputs
		Differentiating the error function yields the updated difference
		Update weights by update difference

Calculating tension from the length of a spring in a spring model and using it to update the position of a vertex is only an approximate calculation on a poor machine, and as the Deep Learning boom speeds up the devices that do this type of calculation, better physics will be possible.
