Good Question Stamp
	I've created a "[good question]" emoji in the [unexplored junior] chat, and I'm actively pushing against [question].
	Cultivate [psychological safety] that says, "It's okay to ask questions."
		It is hard for the questioner to ask a question and not get a response to it
		When they leave me alone for long periods of time, I feel like I shouldn't have asked those questions here.
		Fast rewards should be given to those who ask questions.
	However, I can't always answer for myself.
	　And to reply without an answer:.
	　　Pointless notifications are noise
	　　Questions drifted away, and not well.
	I'm just wondering if it's a good idea to add an emoji reaction.
	　I made a custom emoji called "[good question]".
