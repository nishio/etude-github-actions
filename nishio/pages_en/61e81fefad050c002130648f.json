Success, Failure and Death

This is what it looks like when you have a [narrow] vision.

　If we assume that there is a fork in the road between "the road of success" and "the road of failure," when we see a "side road that might fail," we think, "If I go this way, I'm going to fail, so let's not do it."
 But success doesn't fall that close to the main street (if it did, it wouldn't stay because the first person with great luck to find it would take it).
	Death is at the end of every road, so it is impossible to avoid death, and on the road to death, there are "failures that can be undone" and "successes that will not last forever". And since failure is usually at the front of the road, if you think of "avoiding failure," you will not be able to get success either.
	When you see "death" or "irreversible failure" on one side of the branch, of course you should avoid it, and when you see "success" on the other side, you can take it. The question is "which way to go when there is irreversible failure on one side and nothing on the other side? At this point, the path of failure is more promising.
