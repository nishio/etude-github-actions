In the history of philosophy, it was first asserted by [Gorgias], [Protagoras], and other [sophists], and [Protagoras]'s assertion that "[man is] the measure of all things" expresses that knowledge and value are only relative in relation to the individual, and his position is [subjective relativism]. The position is [subjective relativism].

Relativism may be associated with "skepticism" because it does not recognize the "universal validity" of knowledge and values.
	Theology, critical of [metaphysics], and in the Renaissance and modern period, M. [Montaigne] was a moralist, T. [Hobbes] a [utilitarian], J. Locke, D. Hume a skeptical relativist from an [empiricist] standpoint.
	I. [Kant] can be said to stand on the position of [critical relativism] in that he recognized the relativity of empirical cognition from the standpoint of [a priori philosophy] and taught inborn cognition.
	In the 19th and 20th centuries, A. [Schopenhauer], F. [Nietzsche], W. [Dilthey] in the philosophy of life, J. P. [Sartre] in existentialism, and W. [James] in pragmatism took a relativist position.
	In the new Kantian school, existence and value were distinguished, and the relativity of value was taught.
	With regard to value, there is the position of [ethical relativism], which holds that the criteria of right and wrong are valid only in relative terms.
	Dialectical materialism] recognizes the relativity of truth, but it is distinguished from so-called relativism in that it seeks to approach absolute truth.
