Avoiding dead storage
>Lately, when I "read" an article, I try to make a note of it in Scrapbox as much as possible. But when I do so, various stories are really connected. I guess this kind of effort is a way to avoid "dead storage".

We usually work under the assumption that the concept expressed by a word X is the same, even though it is different for each person.
	Sometimes when a major problem arises, we express that a "misunderstanding has occurred," but it was never a "0% misunderstanding" in the first place.
		Some areas, such as mathematics, are meticulously and cost-effectively worked out to avoid misunderstandings.
		The average person doesn't care about the definition of a word.
	The reason why it's important to use "[your own] words" is because other people's words are not adequate to express your understanding
