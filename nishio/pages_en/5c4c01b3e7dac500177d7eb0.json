　[what I thought was one concept merged with two nested concepts].

　　[also seems to merge with the figure of [being "X" and "not X" are compatible].
　　In short, the area between these sets is the gray area.

	The [usefulness] of defining the [boundaries] of the [concept].
		In the figure, two people are disputing the boundary of concept X.
		They dispute whether the black circle case near the boundary is included in X.
		Would that argument be useful?
	Suppose it is clear that the white circle is included in X
		Even if the boundary of X is not clear, we can use the fact that the white circle is included in X
		Isn't it [over-quality] to try to define the boundaries of X?
