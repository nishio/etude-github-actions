Put the SID you wrote down earlier here.

$ heroku run -a scrapbox-duplicator-nishio npm run transfer
code::
 Running npm run transfer on ⬢ scrapbox-duplicator-nishio... up, run.1786 (Free)
 
 > @ transfer /app
 > node index.js
 
 (node:21) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Request failed with status code 403

$ npm install
$ node --trace-warnings index.js
