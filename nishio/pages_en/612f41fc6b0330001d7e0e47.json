 　Which direction should we go?
　answer
 　No one yet understands what the ideal Kozaneba of the future will look like.
 　　Should I have arrows? "Should I have touch panel support?" are only hypotheticals.
 　The most important task is to use it first to know what is needed, and the most important task is to use it for various purposes.
 　　In addition, detailed functions can be realized by user extensions, which will increase the number of samples.
