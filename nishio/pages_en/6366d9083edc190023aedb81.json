The study group boom started in 2006, but as the main players got older, had families, and moved up in the world, they had less time to continue the study group and less to gain from it (and also completed their network of contacts).

One such activity is a study group, which is also one of the community activities.
>Now it appears that the communities that once existed are converging into a few.
	>[https://twitter.com/wakatono/status/1588928429315227648?s=20&t=BEVn8tYDODF0dwJWTF97Tg @wakatono]: there are some operations that have been going on, but still, few (if any) have been going on for 20 years. There are very few (at the grassroots study group level) that have been going on for 20 years.
 >But that's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's also a set of stories that the channels for acquiring knowledge have been enhanced.
 >The problem is that the activity of teaching each other about emerging technical fields, etc. is locally optimized.

 >Some people think it is not worth it to hold/participate in a study group when they consider the return on their time and power.
 >After that, people who value the concept of [typa] probably don't see the point in attending (the playback speed of the talks that come out of the workshops are always one times faster).

>I have the impression that there are fewer workshops that are held quickly and vigorously on a single theme.

>And this year, Slack's restrictions on viewing logs have almost entirely moved to Discord.

>I don't think the need for study groups will ever go away as long as the industry is metabolizing!

>Online events are held all over the country, and thanks to Youtube, high-quality archives can also be left behind.
>The presenter's side is more like a seminar, which makes it difficult to have a friendly atmosphere with humor, Q&A, and commentary.
