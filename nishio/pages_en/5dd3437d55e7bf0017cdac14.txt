Dig into the meaning of the word
When there is a [word I don't understand].
	look up a word in a dictionary
	Look up the word in Wikipedia.
	Look up the word on Google

	So far, I was thinking in the context of programmatic automation.
	Recent conversations with [Tomoya Tachikawa] have generated the question, "What does ~ mean in the first place?"
		Example: [definition].
	I had a feeling this was a related activity.
	To [explain] the meaning of a word.
		We're not asking each other to explain "the dictionary says this" or "Wikipedia says that."
