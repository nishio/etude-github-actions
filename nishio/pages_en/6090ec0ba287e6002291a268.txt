 *1349326218*Time taken to read PRML
 >>
 The first PRML reading group started by naoya_t was initially determined to solve all the exercises!ã€€but he failed at the first meeting. He decided to solve the exercises as needed and spent 6 to 9 hours (!) once a month for each session. and read through all 14 chapters in 14 months.
 On the other hand, the in-house PRML reading session at Cybozu Labs was skipped 1/3 of the time at the discretion and prejudice of the leader, and the exercises were reduced to the minimum necessary. Twice a week(!!!) The reading session was held twice a week (!), spending 1 to 1.5 hours each time, and it still took 8 months.

 The former is an average of 7.5 hours * 14 = 105 hours, and the latter is 1.5 hours per session * 2 times per week * 4 weeks per month * 8 months = 96 hours. If you have a guideline (or an estimate) that it takes about 100 hours in total, you may be less likely to lose heart in the middle of the work.
 
 ** Postscript
 
 Mr. Nakatani plugged me that I didn't include the prep time, but <del>I don't want to remember</del> I didn't measure it, so I don't know how much... maybe 3-4 times the time I spent in the study group?
