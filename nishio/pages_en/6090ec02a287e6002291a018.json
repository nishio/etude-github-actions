 *1254814508* Found company entrance card!
 Let's document for future reference what happened to the "missing company entrance card incident."
 
 - There was an inbox to temporarily store documents (this in itself is OK).
 - Unprocessed documents pile up there (temporarily is OK, but they must be emptied properly and regularly).
 - The company entrance card was always in my bag that I take with me when I go to the office (also OK).
 - When you need to empty your bag for something (laundry? Going home?) ), I somehow put my admission card in the document slot (This is my biggest mistake. (This was my biggest mistake. If anything, I should have put it in the box where I keep my keys and wallet because they are classified as "things to take with you when you go out" just like keys and wallets).
 - Pile more papers on top of the one with the entry card in it (I lost my chance for recovery. I should have realized before stacking them that I shouldn't stack them on top of this, but, well, I built the inbox to stack them without thinking about that.)
 - The paperwork piles up so much that it is erased from existence in your mind. They become invisible.
 - I can't find my entrance card anywhere.
 
 *1254837097* Sunshine Ranch Diary
 Synopsis so far: I have accumulated enough savings to grow dandelions in 8 squares, so I planted dandelions all over. Since it takes 50 hours for dandelions to mature, there is nothing to do after increasing the production to 100%.
 
 If 50*8 squares of dandelions are harvested tomorrow evening, I can roughly estimate that I will gain a little over 2000 experience, which will bring me to Lv9 + 500 exp. I have to use the carrot technique, which allows me to buy 1 Exp for 2 Gold, so I have 4200 Exp. I'm not sure if I can get there just in time or not. I'll have to actually harvest tomorrow to find out. It's a tight line.
 
 Well, but if you were just barely short of reinvesting in dandelions, you'd be right to prioritize getting livestock. It would be better to plant only 7 dandelions than to lay down 8400 in cash and spend 50 hours to grow dandelions. The real problem is that there are cucumber seeds and such halfway through the daily events.
 
 How long does it take to buy 8 carrot seeds, plant 8, and dig 8? Assuming 24 seconds, it would take 12900 seconds to get 4300 exp, which is about 4 hours. Mmmm, that's much longer than I expected.
 
 It's a hassle, so I think I'll plant dandelions again.
 
 **1254845823*Inputs and Outputs
 It may be obvious if you notice it, but for some reason I had not been aware of it until now. Input and output are different ways of using the brain. Even when I can't output, I can input.
 
 If you can't do output, why not do input (Marie-Antoinette)?
