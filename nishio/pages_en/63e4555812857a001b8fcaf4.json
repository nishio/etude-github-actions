Postponement is just borrowing peace of mind from the future.
From reading notes on the book "[Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique].

from [Leverage Memo: Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique].
 [Why does "postponement" occur?
 Stress.
 	Sense of being made to do things by others
 	Pressure to be perfect
 	Fear of failure or criticism
 Postponement temporarily relieves these stresses.
 	The behavior of "putting off" is reinforced because of the mental rewards this provides.
 	But this is just [borrowing peace of mind from the future].
 	The more you borrow, the more you suffer with interest.
 Stress comes from within you.
