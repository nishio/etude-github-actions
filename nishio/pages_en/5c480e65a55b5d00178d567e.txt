A vision where money comes first.
	It is up to each individual to decide what kind of [vision] he or she has.
	So there are those who hold the vision that "[money comes first].
	I personally wouldn't want to work with someone like that.
	But each individual chooses based on "whether he or she [shares the vision] or not.
	So there is no need for me to impose my [ideas] on others.
