Cost per unit
[https://gyazo.com/c86c0724dfc3caed48081d4364b1be10]
	Especially in business models where physical products are made in factories, the more units produced, the lower the cost per unit.
		We call this [economies of scale].
	However, "the bigger the scale, the lower the cost" is not always true.
		In some cases, the processing cost per case increases as the amount of data increases, especially when it comes to information processing.

Simple example
	A customer comes to the receptionist and says his or her name. Based on that name, I want to retrieve that customer's information.
	How does the time cost of processing 100, 10,000, or 1,000,000 customers vary?
	A naive implementation (linear search) has a time cost proportional to the total number of customers N
	This is expressed as "it's an O(N) process" (order N)

It is known that the same objective can be achieved with O(log(N)) by devising an algorithm (order log N) see [Equilibrium Binary Search Tree https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/平衡二分探索木]

	Complex algorithms often have high overhead, making them more expensive when data volumes are small.
	Which algorithm is appropriate to use depends on the amount of data in actual operation.
	　Choosing the right algorithm is an important design decision for business applications of information processing technology.

Why do these phenomena occur, especially with regard to information processing?
	The phenomenon of "costs going down as the scale increases" occurs when costs are shared among the products produced, regardless of the number of units.

	For information processing, this cost is often a lower percentage of the overall cost than in equipment industries such as factories
		For example, server costs are often not a fixed amount to begin with, but rather a service that can be flexibly increased or decreased based on customer volume, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2).
		As a result, the relative "effect of lower costs due to increased scale" becomes smaller and less noticeable.
