Mercury (company name)
My First Selling Experience on Mercari

When you sell on Mercari, you will receive an email like this

		I'm afraid I'm going to miss the key information at the beginning of the title, which is "Sold, ship."

I can't find a list of things to do.
	>You can check the "To-do list" from the icon in the upper right corner of the home screen after launching the application.
		First of all, I'm confused because I can't find this "to do" list.
		Conclusion: The Mercantile App was on the search screen because I had run a search to introduce my listing on Facebook just prior to the event. The search screen meant that the "icon in the upper right corner of the home screen" was not displayed.

		By the way, if you click on the bell icon at the bottom, there is a tab called "Notifications", but there is no lead-in there. Not even a notification of the sale. Are you only notified by email?

This is what happens when you click on a list of things to do

They sold packing tools at Lawson's store, so I bought those and packed them.

	Couldn't find it at any other convenience store.
		My wife said, "It's in a hard to find place, or you have to tell the clerk to get out."

I don't know how to ship.
	Okay, I'll ship it, I thought, but then I looked closer and didn't see Lawson as an option?

	Can't you ship at Lawson?
	Trying to ship with a family member.
		There is no "Yu-Packet Plus" in the size options at the QR code creation.

	[Announcement from Mercari [Introduction of New Delivery Service] "Yu-Packet Plus" is newly added to Yu Yu Mercari Mail! https://jp-news.mercari.com/2019/10/16/release-yupacketplus/]
		Watch the video commentary -> Unusual machine at the post office is used to produce seals
		Are you saying that Yu-Packet Plus is only accepted at the post office?
		Even if that were the case, wouldn't the post office be able to issue a sticker if they couldn't issue a QR code?

		>The Lawson e-Shipping Service website also provides shipping instructions. For more information, please click here.
  > Scan the 2D code displayed on the transaction screen into the Loppi at the store to output an application ticket.
  > After output, bring the application ticket and the package to the cashier for shipping procedures.
		The description starts with "the 2D code displayed on the transaction screen", but I don't know how to get that out.
		This is what the link [e-Shipping Service｜Lawson https://www.lawson.co.jp/service/shipment/e-hasso/] explains
			>After pre-registering for package shipment on the auction site or flea market application, please obtain an "inquiry number (12 digits)" and "authentication number (4 digits)" or two-dimensional code.

Conclusion: Two incompatible systems exist: "Raku-Raku Mercari-bin" and "Yu Yu Mercari-bin
