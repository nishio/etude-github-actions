Lickety-split and Imposter Syndrome
Maybe [the feeling of being licked] is just the flip side of [the Imposter Syndrome].
　Others' evaluations of you are different from your expectations
　Feeling angry because your expectations are lower than you expected is "feeling licked."
 Higher than one's expectations and distress is the "Imposter Syndrome."
