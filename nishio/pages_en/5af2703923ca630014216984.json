KJ Method, Clean Space and Mind Palace
Today's Reminders
 A method of structuring, organizing, and supporting ideas by physically arranging information in the form of sticky notes [KJ method].
 It is a method that encourages the discovery of blind spots and new insights by moving the client to different locations and seeing the task and themselves looking at it from a variety of different perspectives [Clean Space].
 The knowledge to be remembered is placed in an imaginary space imagined in the brain and recalled by the imaginary self moving around the space, a method to achieve memory retention using the information of the place as a hook [Mind Palace].
These three methods integrate smoothly and compensate for each other's weaknesses.
