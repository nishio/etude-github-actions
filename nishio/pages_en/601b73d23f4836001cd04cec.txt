Provide explicit feedback on missing keywords.
 When none of the keywords
 　Now we don't use the keyword "then what happens?" which does not use keywords.
 　However, users who fall into this situation have entered keywords that were not included in the first place, so they answer new questions in the same way and do not improve.
 　Feedback should be given that a response without explicit keywords is not good enough.
 Should feedback be given even when there are few keywords?
 　I did.
 　Immediate feedback when the number of keywords per log count falls below 0.5
 　　Since it means less than 1 keyword per utterance.
 　When it's below 1, it's appropriate to combine it with the keywords that are being extracted.
 　　Specifically, the pace at which feedback is given at the 6th time when there is one keyword per utterance.
