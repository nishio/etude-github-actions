consideration
　Hmmm, stockpiles are treasures, so they're in the way when you want to pull them off.
　I bought a blacksmith shop because I wasn't able to pull it off, but I'd rather have bought a garden as quickly as possible?
　Let's try again with the same supply, but add chameleons.

First move, village moneylender
　Village. 3 gold, workshop.
　Moneylending, 5k, festivals
　Village, moneylender, workshop. 2 bounty hunters acquired.
　Festivals. Festivals.
　Bounty hunter banished from mansion; 6 gold for gold
　2 draws at Chameleon Festival, moneylender, bounty hunter banished from the mansion, blacksmith for 4 gold.
　Chameleon Festival, village blacksmith, moneylender, renovations at the workshop, festival and village for 8 gold.
　Chameleon Festival Village Village Moneylenders, renovations to renovate the house, blacksmith for 4 gold.
　　The enemy bought the colony.
　Chameleon Festival x2 Blacksmith Village, pulled off. Moneylender village festivals. Renovation by renovation to craftsman. Renovation in workshop, festival blacksmith for 9 gold.
　　I think I can pull this off and it's 8 gold, but that's not going to get me to 100 points.
　Chameleon Festival x2 blacksmith Chameleon Festival village blacksmith (pulled off) blacksmith (pulled off) moneylender, craftsman for the festival. Festivals. Festival with artisans. Festival in the village by renovation. Festival with the workshop by renovation. colony with 12 gold.
　Draw off, renovate the moneylender and turn it into gold coins. Draw it at the Chameleon Festival. Renovate the village into a festival, festival with artisans. 19 gold and 9 purchased. Colonial Province
　Draw off and expel the previous victory points by bounty hunters. Craftsman for gardens and renovations to craftsman for renovations. Draw in blacksmith and further garden. 17 gold 10 purchased. Colony, garden.
　I drew 4 victory points, garden in artisan.
　　Enemies bought colonies and lost.

That's a tough one.
　Undo before the garden
　 2 festivals for 2 gold with 2 renovations. Draw a stockpile at the craftsman, put it on deck, and draw all that you just acquired at the blacksmith. 22 gold 9 purchased. The province is now tied. Now we are tied.
　Pull-off. Gold for renovations with renovations. Bounty hunter in craftsman. 21 gold, gentry gentry dukedom. 58:46.
　Accident, 6 money, public domain
　Craftsman, garden. 15 gold...15 point lead in colony and garden to win but not 100 points. 78:62 with gardens x3 and workshop.
　Two pieces left and could not be pulled off. Garden in the workshop, gold in the renovations to the genus. Take a blacksmith in a craftsman and load it on deck. Gold coins to the province by renovation. Bounty hunter at the workshop. 3 gardens for 15 gold (bought out), then 3 gold and 3 purchased. House copper coins copper coins.
　Genshu is bought out and the game is over.

　Undo and stop making gold coins belong to the state.
　　Bounty hunter in workshop, no use of renovations. 18 gold 6 purchased. 3 gardens, public domain. 93 points.
　　My opponent bought a genshu and it's not over yet.
　Six cards left and not pulled off.
　　19 gold for the colony, gentry, and 4 copper coins.

　　I managed to do Undo many times.
　　This is not considered a release of performance.

consideration
　The problem at the end of the day is that the AI will finish the game even if you're losing.
