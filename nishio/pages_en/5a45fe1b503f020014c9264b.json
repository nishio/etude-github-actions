Why did we use logistic regression?

  Using [logistic regression] instead of the trendy Deep Learning
  It explains why.

 reason
 	Easy to understand behavior (unlike Deep Learning, etc.)
  Highly resistant to noise
   This feature is convenient because the data comes from crowdsourcing.
  Since it is a stochastic model, it is natural to interpret output values as probabilities
  	As a result, it is easy to map output results to human-understandable descriptions (e.g., "easy parking")
  It is easy to understand how much influence the features have on the results.
   This makes it easy to verify that the model is working properly.
   For example, a prior hypothesis that a certain complex feature would be useful in solving a problem was rejected by the actual data.
   Some of the simpler features were found to be beneficial
