Nodal Point of Thought 2022-02-10
I think it would be good to do Ikujiro Nonaka's [Knowledge Creation Enterprise] after the study group on [Experience Process and Meaning Creation].
The famous [SECI model] is a cycle in which unspoken tacit knowledge becomes formal knowledge and then becomes tacit knowledge again.
We are talking about the same process by which "felt meaning" becomes a symbol or returns to felt meaning again in the experience process and the creation of meaning.

It focuses on the "individual," although the experience process and the creation of meaning is by far the more detailed description of the interaction of symbols and meaning.
Conversely, knowledge-creating companies have an "individual and organizational" axis, not just an "individual" axis.
If we call it "organization," it is abstract, but in the context of [Cybozu], I think this is "the process of [knowledge creation] through [interaction] between [individuals] and [groupware] (and other [communication venues]).

When Ikujiro Nonaka wrote that, there was still little knowledge about groupware, and it was perceived as passive, just accumulating information. This is more about [asynchronous communication].
On the other hand, synchronous communication such as chat, [videoconferencing], and notification mechanisms have developed considerably, and they are also different from "offline, verbal synchronous communication" ([voice conversation]) in that they are logged and recorded.
This area seems to be connected to the previous indication that there is something to be discovered in the area of [flow and stock].
