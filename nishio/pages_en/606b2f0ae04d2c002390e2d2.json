Tutorial for making ðŸ¤” sentences
from [ðŸ¤”Make 3 explanations of how to use Regroup in specific applications].

 Examples of using Keicho for making sentences
 ã€€[Consider the following explanations of new features].
 ã€€ã€€What you write in the commentary is first discussed in the chat and then rearranged and composed in Regroup.
 ã€€[I would like to come up with an explanation for the ability to create a map of Regroup from chat logs].
 		Whenever we discuss how to explain a new feature, the perspective always changes dramatically.
   That's probably because when you've finished implementing a new feature and you're thinking, "Well, how do I explain this?" you're in the creator's point of view.
   This time the change of perspective was illustrated. Typical, like the viewpoint before the change is user-absent.
 Ideally, Keicho and Regroup would complete the process, but users are unfamiliar with either tool.
 ã€€A good experience is not possible if the questions are not answered well and the resulting stickies made are not good enough.
 ã€€Seems like a good way to answer the empathy writing question.
 ã€€I tried to imagine speaking in "listen first" mode while looking at the list of questions in [6 Minute Sentence], but I thought Keicho should just ask these questions because it's a pain to go back and forth between the list and Keicho.
 ã€€You can ask in-depth questions about what you've written.

ã€€ã€€Pros
ã€€ã€€ã€€If your goal is to experience Keicho, you should experience the questions that come with what you write.
ã€€ã€€ It gives a sense of "they're listening" unlike existing template-filling mechanisms.
ã€€ã€€ Fill in a lot of questions and then ask about them and you'll get a lot of quotes.
ã€€ã€€It would be nice if the "next question" button could be used to move on when it is difficult to answer a question, etc.
ã€€ã€€This means [- ðŸ¤” add commands depending on the state][âœ… answer choices are made server side].
ã€€ã€€ã€€I had been thinking "wouldn't it be nice to be able to answer with a button depending on the last minute question", but it seems more versatile and better to control by state
ã€€ã€€ã€€This is [change answer choices depending on ðŸ¤”environment].
	[âœ…Create an empathic lighting mode.]

ã€€Write an explanation of how to use [writing support mode].
ã€€ã€€Regroup needs to be explained.
ã€€ã€€Include modifications to make it easier to use on the part of Regroup.
