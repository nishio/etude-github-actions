Positive feedback

	It's getting bigger and bigger, and the rate of increase is accelerating.
	[Positive feedback
		Not to be confused with "positive feedback" in communication.
	Right figure, cases that become smaller and smaller, and the rate of decrease accelerates, are also "positive feedback" cases
		Often misunderstood because of the atmosphere of the word "positive."

	When a value deviates from a reference value, a force is applied that magnifies the deviation (= positive, in the same direction as the direction of the deviation)
	Therefore, both "accelerating in the direction of increasing" and "accelerating in the direction of decreasing" are positive feedback.

	What is [negative feedback]?
	Conversely, when a deviation from the reference value occurs, a force is applied in the direction to reduce the deviation.
	So, after a deviation due to disturbance, etc., the deviation decreases and returns to the original standard value.
	So negative feedback brings [stability].
	Some people make the mistake of thinking that the word "negative" makes it bad, but it doesn't correspond to good or bad.

	Also called [positive feedback] and [negative feedback
	[Howling] is an example of [positive feedback].
		The sound that comes in through the microphone is magnified and comes out through the speakers, which are then picked up again by the microphone, developing into a loud sound.
	Everything that is stable around us involves some form of negative feedback.
		For example, body temperature
			When the body temperature rises, sweat is produced on the body surface to cool down by vaporization heat to lower the temperature.
			When the body temperature drops, the muscles quiver to produce heat and raise the temperature
