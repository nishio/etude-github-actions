matroid
[https://gyazo.com/51f048871eb1073c9644717dffee67ff]

　We say that (E, F) is a matroid when the family F of subsets of a set E satisfies a convenient property
　If it is maximization over matroids, [greedy method] yields the optimal solution
　subset contained in F is "independent".
　F basically does not enumerate all (because that would be the same order as a full search).
　 Instead, it is sufficient to define a function "[independence oracle]" that returns whether a subset is contained in F

Definition.
	A1: [$ \emptyset \in F] 
	A2: [$ X \in F \Rightarrow \forall (Y \subset X) Y \in F]
		Hereditary
		If X is in F, then all subsets of X are also in F.
	A3: [$ X,Y \in F, |X| < |Y| \Rightarrow \exists x, x \in Y, x \notin X, X + \{x\} \in F ]
	　If Y is larger, you can pick one and add it to X

　　Note that it is not arbitrary x

The maximal independent sets (groups) to which no more elements can be added are all of the same size.

Example
　A set of vectors E and a family F of a set of first-order independent vectors
　 A2: A vector that is part of a linearly independent vector is linearly independent
　 A3: There is a vector in the higher order space Y that is first order independent of X
　A family of sets with less than or equal to a certain number of elements
　　uniform matroid
　　The figure at the beginning of this page shows a uniform matroid with less than 2 elements
　split matroid
　　Partitioning E into several sets and selecting at most one element from each set.

　Edge set E of an undirected graph and F(forest) without closed path
　 closed circuit matroid
　The edge sets E and F of an undirected graph are [pseudoforest].
