	>Aο- one of the specific events in the original system (starting system) (issue to be cleared or other model)
 > Bτ - Event (invention, completion of development) that appeared in the transformation system (attained system)
 > vi - Perspective (angle or position from which to look at things, direction of thinking: choose one perspective that fits your development objectives)
 > ε - abstract elements extracted from Aο under one perspective (the core of things, the center of desire)
 > c - limiting conditions that give concreteness to abstract elements
 > cε - concept (idea) at the core of embodied development
 > Σa - a special set of conditions for the original system (unnecessary elements in the model, subject to disposal during development)
 > Special set of conditions for Σb-transformed systems (new elements required at the time of development, subject to introduction)
	Don't think of it as a formula, it's a picture.
 Well, "structural formula" is also a diagram, so "formula" doesn't necessarily mean "equation."

		This is easier to understand.

	All of the following emphasized analogical thinking
 	[Kamehisa Ichikawa], "[Methodology of Original Research]" (1944).
 	[Polia], "[How to] Solve the Problem" (1945).
 	[Wertheimer], "[Productive Thinking]" (1945).
	At the same time, the problem-solving method [TRIZ] by Outshuler was born in Russia (1946).
	Ichikawa: "How can analogy lead to the creation of new concepts when it is in principle mimetic thinking?"
	1955 "[Equivalent Conversion Thinking Method]"
	The essence of creative thinking is determined by a pattern of thinking that conceptually processes one or both of two different objects, introduces an appropriate point of view, and finds as many of the various aspects (equivalence) common to both as possible" ("Creativity Research Vol. 1," 1964, Seishinshobo, p. 20).

The "equivalence" seems to be related to what you said in "[Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning]" about "finding an 'aspect of experience' between two meanings.

　Is this what you mean?

 Criticizes the tendency of analogies to be biased toward superficial features.
 　Talking about how to do abstraction.

	I wonder if they thought to verbalize the analogy process in more detail so that it could be consciously implemented.
	The story of how to explore departure system A
	What is a "point of view"?
	　Direction of resolution."
	　I thought it was "direction" in "[the image appears to overlap depending on the viewing direction]", but I guess not.
	The Nature of the Problem."
		Verbalize your point of view."
			interesting
		　It's a similar idea to "[verb form over noun form]."
	Ah, I see. This is "[how and what]."

　　[What would you like to see happen?"] Situations where you can answer the "how" to make it happen, but don't know the "how" to make it happen.
　　Look for examples that include "what happens."
　　Remove irrelevant features from the "how" part of that case study.
　　Then add the characteristics of the problem area
   Abstract and apply
   	It's Yotaro Hatamura's [climbing up and down metaphor].
　　The "P" in the figure is the P of PDCA.
　　 One of the ways [how to generate the first P
　　 　Since the PDCA cycle has not yet been born from time to time
　　 The analogy makes this process one step that isn't specifically verbalized.
　　 Are you saying "it's not an analogy" in reference to the fact that it was verbalized and divided into steps?
　　 Because analogies deal with similarity through non-verbal methods, they tend to be biased toward superficial similarities, such as similarities in appearance.
　　　Did you try to eliminate bias by verbalizing the steps and consciously doing so?
