Strong and Invincible
At first glance, I thought, "Well, he's invincible, so he must be strong.

The premise is the concept of the "weak and invincible" person.
　>People who can't adapt to society, who have no joy in life, no goals, nothing to protect.
 > I don't care if I get caught or executed because I have nothing to lose.
 > I'm powerless, so I have nothing to fear I'm powerless, so I want to show my strength
 > So you ironically call such people "invincibles".
 Invincible."
The logic is that because they have nothing [to lose], attacks from others do not damage them, and therefore they are invincible.

Strong and invincible" is a derivative concept.
　Actions born of a "no fear of losing" mentality can become "successes" after the fact, depending on the direction in which they are directed.
　In that case, that person becomes a role model for the "invincible person."

　>The "strong" invincible psychopaths who are not bound by the law can easily make a breakthrough in society and become "successful" because they do not feel guilty about stepping on the toes of ordinary people, and as a result, more and more invincible people are attracted to them.
