Diary 2022-10-13

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1580076292439179265 @nishio]: I recently saw someone making an AI-based cartoon of [sketch artist]'s comments when [camera] was born, but I didn't write it down, so I can't find it I didn't write it down, so I can't find it anymore.
> Since we are witnessing the birth of a new area right now, this post reminded me that it would be useful later on to record what I see and hear now.

It is quite difficult to imagine the impact of the birth of the camera on society, or the feelings of painters toward photographers. But only now, in early October 2022, following the keyword "AI painter" on Twitter may help us to imagine them.

My story diverges from this panel in this one.

>The above is the original picture of the cat that I still use as my project avatar.
> This is the first physical product I made

>In fact, past experiments have generated many photographic-like pictures. The only reason why there are no such pictures in the project's image list is that we and our couples are rejecting them. We have only released 1,500 of the 40,000 pictures we have generated so far. Examples of rejected pictures (we never introduced them before)

> I said, "Isn't this cat well drawn?"
> Wife: "In a place where cute pictures and videos of real cats abound, generating a realistic picture of a cat will never beat the real thing."
> I "Sure thing."
> That wife is the one who made the choice and 24 people like it on instagram.

>Personally, I think the above is too subtle to be recognizable as a cat without being told it is a cat, so I prefer this one, even if they are the same "strange creature" type. I also made this one into a book cover the other day.

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1580226884113403904?s=20&t=lg3BC3Hpj9Lr7_S4gaMn0A @nishio]: "Engineers who understand what's inside of a camera" made a camera specialized for a certain field of art style. I think it's fair to say that the target audience will be repulsed by the camera. On the other hand, even if I specify cubo-futurism, I still end up with a picture like this, which is less attractive to me.

> With the original Stable Diffusion, you get a picture like this. In other words, by specializing in a particular area, the success rate in that area is increased, and the success rate in other areas is decreased (attracted to the target area).

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1580229221477388291 @nishio]: in other words, this is about me and my wife's "[definition of good]" not fitting the NovelAI Diffusion.
> I gave this kind of explanation the other day and someone asked, "Do you have to go that far to get a good picture?" I was asked, "Does it depend on the definition of "good"?
>[Relationship between seed and prompt for Stable Diffusion].
>One aspect of art activities is to define "I think this is good" and present it to the world
>What I'm doing is automating image generation and generating prompts through reinforcement learning, so to use a camera analogy, it's like "the camera will keep automatically releasing the shutter, and the camera will use its own judgment to compose itself by moving its head around, learning human preferences for which composition is best".
> So the "I think this is good" search part was replaced by machine trial-and-error instead of human trial-and-error to speed up the process.
> In addition to that, I am a "software engineer" kind of artist, so I also "think this is good" as a meta-artwork of "a system in which a machine automatically keeps creating pictures to my liking.
> And so "creating a network of meaning based on a set of pictures created by an AI" is another layer of artwork [medium of art].
>I want to express "I think this is good" not as one concrete work "point" x, but as the "establishment distribution" p(x) that generates it. Each piece is a point x1, x2, ... sampled from p(x) [art as a probability distribution, not a point].

　How Scrapbox merge updates work
	　First, read the existing JSON
	　Get page lines, empty list if there are no pages
	　If you don't have a link to Gyazo, add it.
	　If there is no CAP-tan line, add one.
	　If there is no INS-tan line (which there usually isn't now), add one.
	　Add any other additional information as SCBO-tan lines
　Now I skip it as soon as there's a page.
