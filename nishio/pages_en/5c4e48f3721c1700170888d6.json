Is a page title required?
	Currently Scrapbox needs a title on the system.
	When I first started using it, I thought, "It's inconvenient to need a title, I should be able to write right away without a title."
	I still think there should be a way to output that kind of information, but it's being circumvented by operations.
		Often, I "post to Facebook first, then if I have something to add, I continue with a comment under that post and post it to Scrapbox after the gushing has stopped."
			This is equivalent to [Export] without a title
		No big deal if you start writing without a title.
			It will only be automatically saved with the title `Untitled`.
			Duplicate titles are automatically assigned a branch number, so there is no need to worry about conflicts.
		Ctrl+T will enter the date and time, which can be used as a title instead.
			I set the format to my preferred `2019-01-28`.
			More information than Untitled.
			These days, I often add [nodal point of thought https://scrapbox.io/nishio/search/page?q=%E6%80%9D%E8%80%83%E3%81%AE%E7%B5%90%E7%AF%80%E7%82%B9]
				I can't come up with a title because of the dense mixture of multiple ideas that have not yet been clearly separated.
				So for now, I'll just put the information "This is a thought node, written as of 2019-01-28" in the title.
				It's less likely to be read back as it is, so keep it actively bracketed so that it emerges connected to something unexpected in the future.
				When you stand back in time and look at it from a different perspective, you can better organize your thoughts.
	[Pages with tasteless titles will not be read again.]
		The title should be something that inspires you to read it.
		But thinking about a good title from the beginning [increases] the [hurdle] of output.
		[Gradually] a good title would be good.
