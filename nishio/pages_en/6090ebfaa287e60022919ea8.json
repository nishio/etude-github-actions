 *1220816958* I entered the women's bath.
 Well, I may have gone in there as an infant, but I don't remember, so it was practically the first women's bath in my life!
 
 No, no, no, not at all. Of course it's legal!
 
 I could not enter the "bath that can be used for 24 hours" from 4:00 to 5:00 because of cleaning of the bath. So I sat on the bean-bag machine by the entrance to wait until 5 o'clock while writing a program. Then the cleaning man said, "You can take a bath in that (the women's bath) because we haven't put up the sign yet," so I took his word for it.
 
 
 By the way, before people ask me about the women's bath for the first time in my life, it was exactly the same as the men's bath I entered yesterday, except for the red curtains. The men's and women's baths are switched after cleaning.
