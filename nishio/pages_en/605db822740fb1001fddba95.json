It can be foreseen that there will be no beneficial outcome.
The phrase "shall not" is used in two ways. Sometimes it is used not in the sense of being unethical, but in the sense that it is foreseeable to a sufficiently competent person that it will not have beneficial consequences. In this case, if you want to do the deed, you may. However, it is also foreseeable that a sufficiently competent person who sees it will think you are incompetent.
