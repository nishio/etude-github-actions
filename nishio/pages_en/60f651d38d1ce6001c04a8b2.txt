ã€€It was a pretty useful book for my life, but then people started to use it to get smart people to rush into shady businesses and say, "I need to get [financial freedom]!" and then there were people who used the book to get people who were not smart enough to "get it [financial freedom]" and then there were people who got them into shady businesses.
