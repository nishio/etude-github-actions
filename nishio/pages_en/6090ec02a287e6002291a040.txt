 *1259110976*Bismuth
 I bought a bismuth ingot at the <a href='http://www.cyclicblue.com/c3b/'>Shihua Works</a> booth at the Make Tokyo Meeting. It is beautiful on its own.

 Perfect size for a ladle!

 Dororo. Melted more easily than I imagined.

 It was easy to melt the liquid, but I don't understand "to a certain extent" in the phrase, "to a certain extent," when the liquid portion is discarded when it has hardened to a certain extent. After leaving it for a while, the edges of the liquid surface had hardened, so I quickly poured it out. Oh, it was done!

 The liquid of the one who disposed of it is also clean.

 Incidentally, the measuring spoons were not used at all. The ceramic tea bowl cracked spectacularly the moment the melted liquid was poured into it. I might not recommend it.
 
 Well, now that we've taken pictures, let's melt it again.
 
 
 I can't get a good clean shot with the iPhone camera. I would love to have a camera.

 I noticed the center of the liquid dump wasn't solid, so I dumped more and this is what I got. Interesting.

 It's frustrating that there's only so much you can do with 200 g. I should have bought 1 kg.
 
 *1259123736*simplejson in.
 I'm not very good at doing things with packages. I forget what to try and in what order, so I just get it done. I'll just expose my trial-and-error process and let the experts tell me, "No, that's not right! I'll try to get a pundit to tell me, "No, that's not right!

 I noticed two setuptools update failures during the process, and when I was reprinting the logs, I noticed that both of them were in python 2.5. That's the reason for the failures.
 
 Continuing on, I pitched easy_install and it put me back into 2.5. I looked and found that easy_install 2.6 has been added. I see that easy_install (for 2.5), easy_install2.4, and easy_install2.5 are available even though python is 2.6.

 Mmm.... Why go in there.... Nope, my package management skills are not good enough. It became too much trouble, so I tweaked the original script to not use Pit.

 PS: I was told to use <a href='http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv'>Python Package Index : virtualenv 1.4.3</a>. I'll look into it later.
