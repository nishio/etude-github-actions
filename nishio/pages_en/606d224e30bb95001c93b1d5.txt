Act without fear of being misunderstood and misunderstood
I think there are many people in the world who fear that the meaning of their words will not be conveyed as they think. However, there is also a style of behavior where one does not restrain one's actions for fear of [misunderstanding], but rather acts without fear of misunderstanding, and then, after all, is misunderstood, and then repeatedly explains the situation.

[Cybozu] I'm sure many people in the company are familiar with this style of behavior being antsy. And I've seen the CEO explain selective marital status over and over again on Twitter.

The style is not to fear misunderstandings, but to act with a certain degree of misunderstanding in mind, and to provide polite explanations for misunderstandings that do occur as planned.
