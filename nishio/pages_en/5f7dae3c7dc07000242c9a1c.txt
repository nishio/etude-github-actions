Relationship between BWT and SA
Relationship between [BWT] and [suffix array
　Consider cyclic shift [$ T[i..n]] instead of suffix [$ T[i..n]T[0..i-1]] sorted
　　Whichever way you sort, the order is the same.
　SA
　　Array of integers
　　means the starting position in the text of the cyclic shift
　BWT
　　character array
　　Meaning the letter L at the end of the cyclic shift
　　The first F of the cyclic shift is sorted, so sorting this array yields
　　We can build a mapping from L to F, and from here we can reconstruct the text.
