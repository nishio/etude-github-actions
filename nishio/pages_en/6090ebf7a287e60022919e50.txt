 The inn is full of nature.
 
 There are a total of four massage chairs, all free of charge. There is also a rather recent massage chair that squeezes your calves into a bulging pack. This is a great place to stay for 5,000 yen per night, and it has wireless LAN.

 But as expected, a week-long development camp from morning till night is getting tiring. One more day to go.
 
 **1212153979* Put timer in laptop
 I almost 100% of the time I forget to "do that thing in 10 minutes" until 10 minutes later, so I use a timer to Notify after 10 minutes, but I often forget to bring it. I searched for a way to use Grawl on my Mac to notify me, and found ProdMe.
