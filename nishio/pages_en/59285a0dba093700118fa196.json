Agile Writing

Output to the blog has been decreasing due to the establishment of the output destination of books. This in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but the cycle between output and feedback has become longer, which is not good.

Three years ago I would have said this, but after three years I solved the problem by "pre-releasing one of each chapter to reviewers every three weeks"!

Furthermore, three years from now, I'm thinking of moving to a wiki-like structure instead of a blog (not that I want to co-edit, it's hard to describe).

If you think about it, this is the third time I've used the strategy of making the cycle smaller. The first experiment, "serialization in a magazine," was too strict with the restriction that the serialization had to be completed in two pages. The next experiment, "serialization on the web," did not go well because I could not control the timing of publication (when on earth will the mind map story be published...).
