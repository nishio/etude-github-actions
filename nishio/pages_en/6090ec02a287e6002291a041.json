 *1259204635* Macho iPhone
 The bottom half of the iPhone has three horizontal rows and four vertical columns of smudges due to flick input.
 
 It looks like a pair of cracked abs.
 
 You're a cocky iPhone guy.
 
 *1259213250*[Kaizen] Diary
 Through a series of various kaizen efforts, life is slowly beginning to turn out well. Slowly but steadily, they are learning life skills.
 
 But I hadn't put the clothes to be washed in the washing machine, even the detergent, and turned it on. I was going to meet someone, so I decided to wear something a little more decent than usual, but there were no options. I need to make a choice before storing my laundry in the closet instead of storing it in the washing machine.

 The phrase that hit me the hardest in this book was "like flushing poo. I have repeatedly missed the timing to throw out the trash after the garbage bag was full, or missed the time to wash the laundry after it had accumulated, as I did this time. It's like saying, "Isn't it more economical to save water by flushing the toilet after it's been filled? Then, when you try to flush the toilet after it's been filled, it doesn't flush and you end up with a big problem. And it smells while it's still in the tank.
