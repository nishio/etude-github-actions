Import to Scrapbox
from [pKakidashi-done]
Import to Scrapbox
	old
 	Can be exported in text format
 	Better if it can be imported to Scrapbox with a single button press
	Can be [copied and pasted as normal text
		Scrapbox-like nature as each item is on its own line
		Here we go.
			The reason I thought I needed an import function was because I was using a tool that didn't allow me to "copy and paste as normal text".
