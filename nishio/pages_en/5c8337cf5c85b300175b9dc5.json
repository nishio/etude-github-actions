Hooks for searching and fishing
[https://gyazo.com/47d25f819cac3f79d1aee54c67fc1879]

The metaphor of "[hook for fishing]" was used by thinking that "[fishing]" means to "verbalize" the experiences in an individual that have not yet been verbalized. However, I realized that this [search] is also "[fishing]" because there is a large amount of information in the search engines that cannot be contained within an individual.
