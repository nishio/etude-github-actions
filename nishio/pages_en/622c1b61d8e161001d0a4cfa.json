harm done to young people
>[Jun Kuikei https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10226630159276703?comment_id=10226631141941269] Young people are similarly biased that "old people are less capable of learning or new information, and and biased, mistakenly thinking they are closer to wisdom than they are.
>And this phenomenon is the same kind of behavior because it is based on the logic that one can stay in touch with the correct information.

This seemed like a good opening.
The two have the same structure.
ã€€The old assume that the "young" are "uninformed" about the correct information that has stood the test of time.
ã€€Young people assume that the "Mere Old Man" does not know the correct information that is newly born recently.

In both cases, by thinking "I have the right information and the other person does not," they are losing the opportunity to obtain information from the other person that they do not yet know.

Invention of the term "young harm."
>[Toshiyuki Masui https://www.facebook.com/toshiyukimasui/posts/10160021731407498] Isn't it "young harm" for young people who only know MarkDown to say, "MarkDown is awesome! is not "harming the young"?

I've been criticized in the comments section for not understanding the structural contrast I wrote about above.
	The same structure as the "old peril" also occurs in the young. Isn't this 'harm to the young'?"
I think the "I" part is a wonderful coining ability.

This comment is also very good
>Kazuhiro Shiozawa: When I first learned about Markdown in 2012 and started using it, I was thrilled and said "Markdown is awesome. But because of that step, I came across Scrapbox notation in 2017 and thought, "Markdown was less than mediocre. Something far more awesome had been invented!" I marveled. I will continue to tell people who are happy with mediocre things that there is something wonderful here ðŸ˜Š.
