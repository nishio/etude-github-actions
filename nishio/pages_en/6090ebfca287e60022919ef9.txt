 I made it with LaQ since the LEGO bricks are still awake at the office. The advantage of using LEGO bricks is that they are lighter and more compact than LEGO bricks for making long, thin objects like this, but the caveat is that they are less rigid and will flex if not designed properly. At first, I had attached the camera appropriately, but then I realized this and changed it so that the center of gravity would be on the top of the pillar. If I put some weight on the light blue and green tails, the pink arm sticking out in front would be unnecessary. I want to fix that because it is annoying when it comes to image processing.
 
 I think the hardware will be completed if I buy some dark-colored drawing paper and draw some lines to indicate where to place it.
 
 The problem is the software, though,

 - http://www.wasp-corp.co.jp/technical/exdoc.cgi?view&oid=card.sdoc
 So I'm thinking that I can quickly write a Python binding for OpenCV.
