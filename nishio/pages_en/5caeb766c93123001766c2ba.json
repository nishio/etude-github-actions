[Management in Peacetime]
	Different cognitive load in normal times and emergencies results in different forms of management.

[Industrial Republic]
	We need to create a higher level system, not just a "corporate" unit.
	Analogy of the transition of the country's governance from an absolute monarchy to a republic.
	The question is how to create [a common language].
		I am interested in how this could be accomplished. Perhaps in peacetime it is an inappropriate level of abstraction to think of a "corporate" unit as a component.
			I wrote: [companies over-abstract].
			When "corporations," the owners of financial capital, are interconnected with "individuals," the owners of knowledge capital, a higher-order system beyond the corporation may be created.
