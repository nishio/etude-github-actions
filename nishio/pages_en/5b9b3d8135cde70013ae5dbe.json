Company earnings
	I've seen feedback along the lines of, "It's great that you support something that doesn't directly translate into revenue."
 	That interpretation would deny the existence of the [research department] because it is not directly related to [revenue].
	In terms of knowledge acquisition, the composition of an individual's study is similar.
 	The composition of gaining knowledge by doing [research] as a job and gaining knowledge by studying as a job are similar.
	We tend to think of "company revenue" as "cash coming into the company," but "knowledge coming into the company" is also beneficial to the company.
	You can turn knowledge into cash, but you can't turn cash into knowledge.
　 Piling up cash doesn't mean you can download knowledge to people who aren't willing to learn.
　 Knowledge] is a more valuable good than cash #Knowledge capital
 Employees who learn are generating revenue [knowledge acquisition].
		We just don't record it in [accounting].
  Running a company by looking only at accounts that do not record revenue from knowledge acquisition underestimates the benefits of knowledge acquisition.
  	This is not a good situation.
