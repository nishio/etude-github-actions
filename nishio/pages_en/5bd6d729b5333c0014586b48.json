Viewpoint cannot be shifted.
We set up a sphere called a teleport portal that jumps to it when it is triggered.
code:cs
 GameObject.Find("OVRCameraRig").transform.position = obj.transform.position;
Viewpoint can be moved on PC but not on Oculus

I thought it might be wrong to run OVRCameraRig directly, so I specified OVRCameraRig as a child of a cube called MeCube, but it still does not work.

Interesting bugs

 When MeCube is triggered, it is treated as a slide and the position of the object moves to the [hitPoint] of the raycast, causing MeCube to move and the camera to move accordingly.
 So, moving the camera by moving the MeCube itself is working as expected.

code:cs
 RaycastHit hit;
 if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, _MaxDistance))
 {
     // Get the object that was hit
     GameObject obj = hit.collider.gameObject;
     obj.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.color = Color.green;
     if (obj.CompareTag("Button"))
     {
     	   ...
     }
     else if(obj.CompareTag("Teleport"))
     {
         obj.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.color = Color.blue;
         if (PCInput.Down())
         {
             obj.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.color = Color.red;
             //GameObject.Find("OVRCameraRig").transform.position = obj.transform.position;
             GameObject.Find("MeCube").transform.position = obj.transform.position;
         }
     }

	It is strange that it is green on Oculus.
 But how is such "tag behavior different between PC and Android" possible?
 Is it wrong that I once created a Teleport named Tereport and deleted it?
 Try restarting Unity.
 Fixed!
