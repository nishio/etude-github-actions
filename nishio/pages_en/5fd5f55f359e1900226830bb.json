Problem conversion note that I didn't notice.
　Given a column →[value determined for the column →DP in the interval of the column].
　Maximize →[Maximize with bisection search].
　[Determination of the size of a real number] → Want to calculate without error, but floating-point numbers are not accurate enough → Bisection search with integer numbers
　Function with huge definition domain -> [exchange of value domain and definition domain].
	2^100~2^10000 -> [attributed to the smallest cut].
