Multi-line import dialog
[Multi-line import
	I started out with a panel of additional sticky notes.
	I decided to hide it without a developer flag to make the demo look better.
	The add stickies panel at the bottom of the screen is not usable on iPhone, so move it to the top.
		No more space for multi-line imports.
	I learned about [Material-UI]'s Dialog, so I rebuilt it with it.

This would be a good way to add a stand-alone sticky note.
