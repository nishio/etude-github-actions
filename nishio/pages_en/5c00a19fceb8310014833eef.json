>There is a widespread illusion that as people get older, their level automatically increases, but age is nothing more than "playing time," and what is needed to "level up" is "[experience]. If you leave the game on until the morning, the "playing time" will increase on its own. There is not much information that can be read from the age.

>It's easy to understand that you don't gain experience by leaving the slimes alone, but it's more of a problem when they keep defeating [slimes] all the time and think "I'm strong now that I can defeat them easily" or "I'm doing well, I'm gaining experience, and I'm getting stronger".

> If your job is to defeat slime, that should be enough.
> The only question is, how long do we have the "slime slaying job"? If I can get away with it, I'll be happy with that.
> People can never let their guard down, but they can never waste their lives over-preparing for an "enemy" that will never come.
> If the "job of slaying slime" looks like it will be there for 100 years, don't worry if all you can do is slay slime. It's just a question of whether you can see it through successfully.

I don't think anyone who has never been out of the slime forest can judge if there is likely to be 100 years of "slime slaying business."
