There are three different pronunciations of the Chinese letter i.
The i after [slurring tongue sound] and after [tongue-tooth sound] is pronounced differently, so if you don't understand it and pronounce it with i, it will be mistaken for qi or xi.
　I tried many times to get Google Translate to recognize "haochi" as "好吃(haochi)" and it gave me "好奇(haoqi)", but this was the reason for that!
　I had a hard time believing that the consonants were mispronounced because they were misrecognized.
　Once I knew the i's sounded different, I practiced a little and they were correctly identified.
