Create an account for the ✅Scrapbox Bot
I want to try [tkgshn/scrapbox-Duplicator: a tool that automatically performs the troublesome "page transfer" when operating separate private and public Scrapbox projects https://github.com/tkgshn/scrapbox-Duplicator] But I'm afraid of full access suddenly, so I decided to create a new account for Scrapbox Bot.
Rather than simply using this, I'd like to do a lot of things with it as a reference, so I thought it would be better for the future.

Create a new Google account and switch profiles

	At first I mistakenly switched my profile from the one that shows up on the Google web page and said, "Huh?" I said, "Huh? You can switch from the top button.

If you switch profiles and access the Scrapbox in-byte link, you'll be prompted to enter your Scrapbox username and stuff since it's your first time accessing Scrapbox.

I'm going to invite a bot into a private project that I created experimentally a long time ago. The idea is to try it out first in a project that is not a big secret before putting it in a project that is being used by one person in a big way.

Get the SID by referring to [Tapping Scrapbox's private project API
You may now close this profile window.
