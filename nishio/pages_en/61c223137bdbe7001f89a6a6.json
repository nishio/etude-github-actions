Fun Driven and Anger Driven
context
 [Anger is a driving force.]
 [Anger is poison.]

I used to think anger was toxic.
　But the claim that "anger at the gap between the ideal and the reality is what drives improvement."

So what drives me to avoid anger?
　I think it's an "interesting" emotion.
　There is a gap between the ideal and the reality in the world.
　　Anger-driven people get angry at gaps and try to change reality.
　　Interest-driven people say, "That's interesting," and try to look at it more closely.
　　　For example, my [human bug] collection is a collection of cases where real people are not behaving ideally.
　　　When you happen to see a discourse on social networking sites that you think is strange, most of the time you don't directly try to correct the person's behavior, you just collect it as an example.
　　　　I was right when I was younger, but: [how I stopped throwing masakari].
　　After careful observation in an interest-driven manner, we often wonder, "What if we did this? If we do this here, it will solve the problem." and "What if we did this?
　　　Then you'll want to give it a try.
　　　This is not a desire to improve the status quo, but a desire to validate understanding
　　　　So when you say, "I tried it and it didn't work," you may be satisfied with "Oh well, this method doesn't work.
　　　　Lacks the ability to tackle problems with persistence
　　　Some people are [tenacious] even though they're fun-driven, right? Why?
　　　→I know empirically that [it's interesting when you work on it with persistence].
