Opinions based on likes and dislikes
If there is a conflict of opinion based on likes and dislikes, there is no point in [discussing].
Mistaking "I hate it" for "everyone hates it" is [an overgeneralization].
　And "I hate everyone" is [a disproven claim] by having someone in front of you who doesn't hate you.
　Sticking to that argument is not a productive discussion.
A lot of people must hate it."
　This is a valid hypothesis
　Whether this hypothesis is correct or not cannot be [verified] by a subjective bump.
　We should move on to a discussion of how we can objectively verify this.
