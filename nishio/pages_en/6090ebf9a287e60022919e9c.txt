 **1219762927* How to make a multi-touch display
 86 The topic came up in chat, so I did a search and found an interesting page.

 A multi-touch display is created by combining an acrylic board, infrared LED, infrared camera, projector, and mirror. The principle is to use the fact that when an infrared LED is lit from the side of the acrylic board, light leaks out only from the area pressed with a finger, and an infrared camera takes a picture of it and processes the image to find out where the finger was pressed. This seems easy to do. The "infrared camera -> image processing -> coordinates -> mouse pointer" part can be done with a Wii remote control and Wiimote Whiteboard, and as I wrote before, WiimoteLib and IronPython can do the processing that WiimoteWhiteboard can't. The only things left are an acrylic board, LEDs, and a projector! I'll just have to buy a projector for now...
 
 *1219763548* Where's the backup?
 I spent two whole days the other day copying the entire contents of my Thinkpad (which I'm not sure whether to send in for repair or not) using XCOPY, but I can't find the folders I'm supposed to have copied to the external HDD that I'm supposed to be copying to. Why is it that there is a 16MB backup log that says "263446 files copied", but where are the important files? I don't know. I can only assume the little guy did Shift+Delete.
