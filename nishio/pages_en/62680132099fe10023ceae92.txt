There's nothing wrong with including images created by others in proposal materials, as long as the source is clearly stated.
　A: Include images created by others without stating the source.
　　Not this one.
　　Image search will reveal.
　　I don't think it's an immediate rejection by itself, but I feel that you are a person who is unclear about the distinction between what you have made and what others have made.
　B: "You can only put in what you make yourself."
　 This is not correct.
	　Some schools are so afraid of A that they knock it to the safe side and teach B.
　And then there's the similar question, "Is it okay to use the library?"
　　You can use it. Because Unexplored Junior is not a "contest to build from scratch".
