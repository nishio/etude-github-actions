disaster prevention practice (practise)
Disaster drills where you don't have to do it to know what to do are not good enough, so I want to do more bad disaster drills.

Setting 1
 Japan set to sink in 24 hours
 Take your passport, cash, etc. to the airport promptly.
 Get on the right plane and get out of the country.
  Considering the number of flights, I'd say Taiwan or Korea.
 Things to do before the night
  Secure Lodging
  Worst case scenario, if you can't secure lodging, you can go to the airport for a day or so.
  If Japan were to sink, wouldn't the savings in Japanese yen and shares in Japanese companies need to be moved overseas in a big hurry because they would disappear?
 Assuming that all sources of revenue in Japan will be wiped out, the company needs a way to earn a living before it runs out of cash on hand.
  In my case, it seems like a good idea to get a programming job through crowdsourcing.
  Computer and network required
  The hotel would have it.
  Hotels have high fixed costs and I want to move to a cheaper place.

Setting 2
 Abducted and dumped in the mountains somewhere with nothing but their clothes on, where they regain consciousness.
 It could be Japan, but I have no idea where it is.
 Need a means of maintaining body temperature before night
  A place to shelter from the wind and rain
 Need to secure drinking water within a few days
 Be careful, because if you carelessly slip off the cliff or sprain yourself, you will really die!
