Task organization is necessary before task management
Putting unorganized [vague tasks] in [todo list] is unmotivating.

You can't put [something that is not clear how to do it] on a list with a one-line description and do it. Because you don't know how to do it.

When you put something on the "to do" list that [the reason why it should be done is not clear], you get a sense of [obligation], like it is something that has to be done.

A todo list is effective in situations where the things to do are clear but too numerous to remember. For example, writing what to buy on a shopping list is clear because the thing to do is "buy.
Do not try to manage tasks that are not clear.

Need to [Organize Tasks] before [Task Management
