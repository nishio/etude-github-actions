 The six clusters prepared at the beginning disappear as they are learned, and finally only two clusters are observed. Since the pattern of convergence varies depending on the initial parameters, let's change the initial parameters and train many times, and make a video of the one that converges to the best result. There were some initial values that could be learned to be Gaussian distributions with X-shaped crossings, but they could not be reproduced because they were randomly chosen.
 
 If I upload a large size photo to Hatena PhotoLife, will it be smaller when I paste it here? I guess I have to go to the Photo Life page and select "original size" to see it. http://f.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20111117175629

 I have included examples of success.
