I want to reuse it on other maps.
	Stickies added while working on an individual map can be reused on other maps.
	　Not sure if that should involve a "screen where all stickies are visible".
　　Need to be creative in the way it is presented.
　　It would be a hodgepodge map of all genres.
	　Proposal to display in search and recommendation when working on another project.
