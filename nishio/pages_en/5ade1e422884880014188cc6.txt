No crossposting.
 [Virtual Nishio Lab] Operation Policy
 As described in [MMORPG parable], there are multiple groups
 I'm in all the groups, and I'd prefer not to post the same content in more than one group if at all possible.
 Dare to post to "the group you think is best suited" and the group will gradually differentiate
	At this point, Lab 1 is mostly about the design of the lab structure itself, since the NDA discussion was done after the fact and the decision to create Lab 2 was made after discussing the issue of the number of people in the lab.

	However, I feel that the self-introductions should be the same everywhere, and the management announcements are the same.

 There is no rational reason for the evolution and growth of a group, and it is greatly swayed by the element of luck.
 A well-grown tree should be increased by dividing the roots
