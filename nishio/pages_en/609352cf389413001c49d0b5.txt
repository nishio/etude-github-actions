I don't want to make it, I want to know what's inside.
>I think people with ADHD often want to try their hand at crafts and making things, get the tools and start making them, and then suddenly get bored and stop when 80% of the work is done. They are not even aware of it, but it is more likely that they want to experience the process of making something and learn how it works, rather than wanting to make it themselves.
> So, I think it's usually around 80% of the way through the process that you understand how it works and are satisfied. That's why you suddenly lose interest and don't reach completion. But even if I don't have the completed work in hand, I have the knowledge and experience firmly in hand. I think that's fine. Let's just throw away the guilt and move on to the next thing.

Okay, that's definitely the case! I thought (ADHD has nothing to do with it).
I want to make] [I want to know] [I want to make] [I want to know] [I want to make] [I want to know].
