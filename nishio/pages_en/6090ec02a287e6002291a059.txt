 *1264086800* A story that Hogan thought was great.
 I read "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/448866301X?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& I was impressed when I read "<a href="creativeASIN=448866301X">The Hoshi wo Tsugumono</a>" and thought it was great science fiction! I thought, "This is actually a trilogy, "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4488663028?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=4488663028">The Gentle Giants of Ganymede</a>", "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4488663036?ie=UTF8&tag= nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4488663036">Star of the Giants</a>," it seems. So I read it right away, and if you were impressed by "Hoshi wo Tsugumono", you must read the rest of the book as well. It's not just a continuation, but a jigsaw puzzle as a whole. It's amazing how the pieces fit together.
