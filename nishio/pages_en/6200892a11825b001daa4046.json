Some people who are new to the [KJ method] or the [writing out method] make the mistake of thinking that they should not write the same thing down, but this is not the case.
The fact that they write the same thing is a sign that it is important.
It is rare that "the same thing" is really 100% exactly the same.
The expressions are slightly different.
By [comparing] it, a better direction becomes apparent.
This is the same concept as finding the [gradient] by [numerical differentiation].
It creates those opportunities, so [duplication] is not something that should be avoided.
You can write as many times as you like about what is important.
