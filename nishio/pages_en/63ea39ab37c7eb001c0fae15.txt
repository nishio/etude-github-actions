In abstraction, we all want to be happy.

	But I feel like if we think too generalized, we all end up with similar content[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
　I think the generalization converges to "everyone wants to be happy"[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　 What is this [abstract concept] of [happiness] connected to in my mind? is different for each person.

　Happy" and "[interesting]" are [subjective] and [abstract], so others don't know what they mean specifically.
　So each individual has to verbalize it.
　If you're expanding the net by verbalizing, when you come across something that seems relevant, you say, "Oh, this seems relevant!" when you come across something that seems relevant.
