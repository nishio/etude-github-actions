Management and Programming
	[Drucker] "[A] good thing about a company is that when it fails, it goes under."
	Some people can do both up to "[moving for now]" and some can't even do that.
 Even among implementations that "work for now," there are [good implementations] and bad implementations
	There are sometimes discrepancies between the programmer's judgment and the management's judgment because there are discrepancies in the assumptions [working hypothesis], [axiomatic system], [values] of what to value highly, and so on.
