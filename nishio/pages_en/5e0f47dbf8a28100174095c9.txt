Obsession with "having to do something."
	I'm taking a break because it's [a vacation], but I'm feeling crushed by the [guilt] of [not doing] something, is this an obsession that I have to do [something]?
	The meme "I have to do something [useful]" and the meme "[I have to rest on my day off]" are fighting each other like a cockfight.
