Drop branches and leaves of existing maps.

	Figures that have been repeatedly discussed, added to, and become more informative.
	How should the process of cutting down and simplifying be?
	Zoom in on important stickies and zoom out to view style
		The people who have made it have the information in their brains, so they can supplement it,
		Can zoom in and out on the tool.
		When sharing as an image, stickies with fine text are just noise.
	It seems like a good idea to create a new diagram with minimal copying and pasting ([cherry-picking]) from a diagram with a lot of information.
	 Currently, you have to select a range to copy.
		 I want to do a single sticky note, "Take this and paste it over here.
	 Not implementing a way to make enlarged stickies smaller.
		 I want the copy and paste to be the first size.
	When cherry-picking from an existing diagram to a new diagram
		Instead of using the pointing device to "select, copy, and paste into a new diagram".
		I was more comfortable with "write out the necessary keywords on my phone and space them out" while looking at the existing diagram.
	Maybe it's because they haven't implemented the former feature.
		If you do the former, you'll need to share a clipboard.
			Split screen on one machine or
			Need to use multiple displays, etc.
		It's a hassle to switch screens every time you copy one thing.
	The fact that there were no groups to reuse and no hand-drawn diagrams, only strings to reuse, may have suited the latter.

	I thought it would never come to an end.
	Under the pressure of "let's [simplify] it so it can be read without zooming in," we cut off the branches and leaves and left only the important parts.
	I've had three useful insights in the process.
	People tend to get stuck with more data than they can handle smoothly...
