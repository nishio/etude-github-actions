Forced to use it to organize tasks
I was told that the listening chat system is not suitable for organizing tasks when there are multiple tasks because it digs into a single task, so I tried a crazy experiment: if that's the case, why not open a chat for each task?
→Conclusion: Objective achieved

consideration
　Open a separate chat for each task and you can drill down individually.
　　That's not the way it was done in the Mattermost era.
　Crystallization of the previous task to a question of value will have a positive impact on the later task.
　　The language in the #2 chat about the importance of the rate of keyword increase gave a strong raison d'être to task #5.
　　Before I started, I thought maybe number 4 would be next.
　The more detailed the individual tasks, the easier it was for humans to prioritize, and the zero chat was in phase mode and not asking questions.
　　It would have been hard to do a recap on each of the five tasks if we had had questions.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I've heard that the current system is not suitable for selecting the next task to do from multiple tasks, so I'd like to try to see what happens if we drill down to the individual tasks.
[nisbot.icon]What type of task is that?

[1st chat https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=Hqnn67vvNwESQihJtNta] End design
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I want to think about the design of the end.
[nisbot.icon]What type of design is that?
[nishio.icon]How do we end this dialogue? First idea, "What just happened?" with the appearance of "I see" and then verbalize the content of the awareness, "Is this a good place to end?" and if "yes", it ends; second idea, "What just happened?" and "Is this a good place to end?" with machine learning.
[nisbot.icon]What type of dialogue is that?
[Nishio.icon]If you ask questions and answer them, the process goes on endlessly. It's exhausting on the human side, and you end up using up all the good keywords, and the quality of the questions usually goes down, and you end up with a bad ending.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of side is that side?
[nishio.icon]NGKW side
[nisbot.icon]What type of question is that dangling question?
[nishio.icon]The longer it goes on, the worse it gets unless there is a sufficient supply of good keywords from humans.

[0th chat https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=JHtIK2CW5uzh543nuKWr]
[nisbot.icon]What type of task is that?
[nishio.icon]Listen first.
[nisbot.icon]Yes
[nishio.icon]Another thing that came to mind during the first chat, looking at the extracted keywords for each step in the early stages, there may be a difference between cases that develop well and those that do not. Maybe we could use that to detect situations that don't seem to work and give advice on how to make them better.
[nisbot.icon]Early stages
(PS: I saw this keyword extraction and thought, "Well, what I want to do is 'design the early stages'.")

[1st chat https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=Hqnn67vvNwESQihJtNta] End design
[nisbot.icon]What kind of human being is that?
[nishio.icon]Aside from that, do you want to do it with machine learning or rule-based?
[nisbot.icon]What type of machine learning is that?
[nishio.icon]Binary classification from a variety of features. What kind of features are needed, like the last input, questions, keyword exhaustion, length of the conversation, and so on.
[nisbot.icon]What type of question is that?
[nishio.icon]I think the probability of prompting awareness depends on the question.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that question?
[nishio.icon](start the second chat)
[nishio.icon]I remembered, depending on the question, I wanted to push the answer choices. Specifically, "Is this a good place to end?" I want to give "Yes" for "Yes" and then press it to end.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]It feels good to end stonily and cleanly. It's better than cutting off a slog that goes on and on.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of feelings are those feelings?
[nishio.icon]It looks like it's done properly. That reminds me, I want to delete the input field at the discretion of the chat system.
What kind of chat system side is that [nisbot.icon]chat system side?
[nishio.icon]I mean at the discretion of the program.
[nisbot.icon]What type of judgment is that?
[nishio.icon]If you decide that the dialogue is over here, erase the input field and end it.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that dialogue?
[nishio.icon](Leave for a moment)

[2 https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=F47ge7f3kRtzPrkiEuYm] [early design]
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I would like to think about the design of the early stages.
[nisbot.icon]What type of early stage is that early stage?
[nishio.icon]In the early stages of this dialogue, there are people who don't get on track well and crash, and I want to help them get on track well.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about that early stage?
The [nishio.icon] chat system asks in-depth questions about keywords, but in extreme cases, for example, there are people who enter sentences with no keywords at all. In such cases, of course, there are no keywords, so it is impossible to ask a proper question.
[nisbot.icon]
 > In the early stages of this dialogue, some people don't get on track well and crash, I want to help them get on track well.
 Where is this early stage?
[nishio.icon]Especially when you use it for the first time, I recommend you to look at the log, but you start it without looking at it and put "what do you want to happen? I recommend you to look at the log, but sometimes you start up without looking at it and put "Nothing" in the "What do you want to happen? Well, aside from such extreme cases, even people who have read the logs to some extent sometimes use too many NGKWs and run out of keywords.
[nisbot.icon]
 > In the early stages of this dialogue, some people don't get on track well and crash, I want to help them get on track well.
 How do you know these early stages?
[nishio.icon](Why so much focus on the early stages?)
[nishio.icon]As for how to know that the early stages are not going well, perhaps a comparison of the logs that are going well and those that are not can be determined by the large difference in the growth in the number of keywords extracted.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that early stage?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > How do you know that the early stages are not going well? If you compare the logs that are going well with the logs that are not going well, there is probably a big difference in the growth of the number of keywords extracted, and that's how you can tell.
 What does this early stage look like?
[nishio.icon]It's already there, but it's like launching a rocket, you have to get a certain speed or you'll crash.
[nisbot.icon]What type of rocket is that?
[nishio.icon]A rocket to reach the moon
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that rocket?
I can detect that [nishio.icon] is not fast enough, but I don't know what to do when I detect it.
[nisbot.icon]What type of speed is that?
[nishio.icon]Speed of keyword growth
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about its speed?
[nishio.icon]On the contrary, some people reduce it more and more.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of person is that person?
[nishio.icon]I'm too rigid in my evaluation of keyword extraction, and if something is even a little bit wrong, I'm going to NGKW more and more. I'm not in the business of creating training data for a keyword extraction engine, but using this chat system is supposed to help me reach awareness(mon), but I'm acting counterproductive.
What kind of chat system is [nisbot.icon] that?
[nishio.icon]Taking out what humans have not yet verbalized.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]By using this chat system, things that have not yet been verbalized can be verbalized, blind spots can be noticed, and such things can happen.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that chat system?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, does it take practice to get used to using it?
[nisbot.icon]
 > By using this chat system, I can verbalize things that I have not been able to verbalize yet, or notice blind spots, or something like that, and I have a high probability of this happening, so I want other users to be able to use it well and experience the awareness.
 What is this chat system like?
[nishio.icon]I'm a counselor who can chat with you 24/7, but my Japanese is a little awkward. If I had to point out every single mistake in Japanese, we wouldn't be able to talk.
[nisbot.icon]
 > By using this chat system, I can verbalize things that I have not been able to verbalize yet, or notice blind spots, or something like that, and I have a high probability of this happening, so I want other users to be able to use it well and experience the awareness.
 Where does this chat system come from?
[nishio.icon](once here, move on to the next task)

[3 https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=1DddeXFQEoja3AUT7SQ4]
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I would like to think about a function to play keywords that are not good.
[nisbot.icon]What type of keywords are those?
[nishio.icon]The one this system uses for questions.
[nisbot.icon]What kind is that one?
[nishio.icon]NGKW peak
[nisbot.icon]What type of system is that?
[nishio.icon]Dig deeper by asking questions for keywords.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that keyword?
[nishio.icon] But often people get too few keywords, as we talked about in another chat... Maybe we should prioritize increasing keywords over modifying them in the direction of reducing them?
[nisbot.icon]What does that keyword look like?
[nishio.icon]Hooks for catching fish
[nisbot.icon]What kind of fish hook is that?
[nishio.icon]The more there are, the more likely you are to catch fish, but more bad hooks don't mean anything.
[nisbot.icon]
 > But as we talked about in another chat, often people get too few keywords... maybe the priority should be to increase keywords rather than to modify them in the direction of reducing them?
 Where is this keyword?
[nishio.icon]I've found some obviously bad keywords, about 110 when I search the logs with NGKW. Some of them are not bad from my point of view, but there are some bad ones like "つ."
[nisbot.icon]Where is that keyword?
They are scattered in [nishio.icon] data files, so you can collect them by writing a tally script.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I've found a few keywords that are obviously not good, I've searched the logs for NGKW and found about 110. Some of them aren't no-no's from my point of view, but some of them are no-no's, like "つ"
 How do you know these keywords?
[nishio.icon]Things that are subject to NGKW commands. The rest may be candidates even if they are not explicitly commanded, but their scores are not increasing.
[nisbot.icon]What type of tally script is that?
[nishio.icon] Lick through all the logs, collect the keywords that are the target of the command, and output them.
[nisbot.icon]What type of log is that log?
[nishio.icon]Stored logs for this system
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about that system?
[nishio.icon]Various failed keywords can be found by various people using it.
[nisbot.icon]What type of failure keyword is that failure keyword?
[nishio.icon]Keyword extraction failures that resulted in strange cutouts.
[nisbot.icon]What type of keyword extraction is that?
[nishio.icon]If the text is somewhat long, it is rather good, but if it is a short word, it tries to force extraction from it and sometimes extracts strange things. The goodness of the keywords found is normalized to a maximum of 100 points, so if the input is such that only one garbage keyword is found, it will be a garbage keyword with 100 points.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Being able to extract good keywords is important.
[nisbot.icon]Where do those keywords come from?
[nishio.icon]Should we just lower the score when the user's input is short or something? Not necessarily, I guess. Sometimes you can put a perfect keyword in one word. I still have to machine learn how good the keywords are.
[nisbot.icon] What should that keyword happen?
[nishio.icon]Bad keywords, even if they are extracted, should score low.
[nisbot.icon] What needs to happen to that keyword for it to work?
[nishio.icon]If you can determine that keyword is bad, good.
[nisbot.icon] that keyword can it?
You can do that if you build that kind of machine learning [nishio.icon].
[nisbot.icon]What type of machine learning is that?
[nishio.icon]We can use a binary classification to learn whether NG or not, and use the probability values as coefficients.
[nisbot.icon]What type of coefficient is that?
[nishio.icon]1 for good keywords, 0 for bad keywords
[nisbot.icon]What kind of good keywords are those good keywords?
I wonder if I can choose the longest user response to [nishio.icon] keywords.
[nisbot.icon]What type of user is that user?
[nishio.icon] People who generate input
[nisbot.icon]What type of input is that?
Answer to [nishio.icon] question
[nisbot.icon]What type of question is that?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > 1 for good keywords, 0 for bad keywords
 Anything else about this good keyword?
[nishio.icon](move to next task)

[4 https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=ob6LxpnTClaKQm9tTCsu]
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I'd like to think about [nishio.icon][judging the naturalness of a question].
[nisbot.icon]What type of judgment is that?
[nishio.icon] Determine if the combination of keywords and questions is natural based on training data.
[nisbot.icon]What type of question is that?
[nishio.icon]Some questions given
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that question?
I think [nishio.icon] "what happens when ~" or some other kind of word that's obviously the wrong kind of word to put in there.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of word is that word?
[nishio.icon]I wondered if I could make a decision from the data without considering that, but it doesn't seem to be working out so well, so I guess I should think about what I would do if I were rule-based and devise a feature set.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Some questions given
 Where is this question?
Preset in the [nishio.icon] system
[nisbot.icon]What type of preset is that?
[nishio.icon] adopted from a method called Clean Language.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of clean language is that clean language?
[nishio.icon](Next task)

[5 https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=g2pG7KlHBULZllCnsdaT]
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I would like to think about [nishio.icon]movement extraction
[nisbot.icon]What type of extraction is that?
When we say [nishio.icon]keyword extraction, the world often extracts noun phrases. It's the same with keywords for dissertations and so on. But when I think about using them for this chat, verbs often come with more concrete images than nouns, and are too good to throw away.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of noun is that noun?
[nishio.icon]If you extract nouns, you get something like this. For verbs, it would be "What kind of 'use' is this 'use'?" And so on. It's a question, isn't it?
[nisbot.icon]What else can you tell us about that noun?
[nishio.icon]Nouns often tend to be abstract concepts, and when asked about abstract concepts, we often tend to answer with something even more abstract, which is not very good!
[nisbot.icon]How do you know that noun?
[nishio.icon]Morphological analysis will tell you.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Nouns often tend to be abstract concepts, and when asked about abstract concepts, they often tend to be even more abstract, which is not very good!
 Where is this noun located?
I'm in [nishio.icon]user input, so I'll take out the verbs and add them to the keywords for now, but some of them like "say" and "see" are not very good, so I need to filter them out.
[nisbot.icon]What type of keywords are those?
[nishio.icon]Also, where do you have the information that it's better to put it in hookah brackets?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of hook brackets are those?
[nishio.icon]Not only verbs, but also words that contain particles should be grouped together, so we can judge by the display part?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of verb is that verb?
[nishio.icon] It's not about "being" or anything, but about the user's active behavior that is important.
[nisbot.icon]What type of user is that user?

[0th chat https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=JHtIK2CW5uzh543nuKWr]
[nishio.icon]So far, we've delved into each of the five tasks in individual chats
[nisbot.icon]Chat
[nishio.icon]The first is the design of the end, which is intended to have the value of "it feels good to end nicely". If yes, then delete the input field." "Take the yes or no information and use it for machine learning in the future.
[nisbot.icon]Choice
[nishio.icon]Second is the design of the early stages, which is "to have many users experience that using this chat system will help them to become aware of language and blind spots," and to solve the problem of getting off track in the early stages.
[nisbot.icon]Early stages
[nishio.icon]You wrote that you can detect the slow rate of keyword increase, but do not know what to do about it. Would visualization help? Rocket launch metaphor, displaying a percentage of how far the value to be achieved in each phase has been achieved?
[nisbot.icon]Metaphor
[nishio.icon]The third function is to play bad keywords. The value is to be able to extract good keywords. This is machine learning of good and bad keywords.
[nisbot.icon] Machine Learning
[nishio.icon]The fourth is the naturalness determination of the question, which has not yet reached the value question. Specifically, I'm thinking that I should devise a feature set for my rule-based approach.
[nisbot.icon]Value
[nishio.icon]The fifth is motion extraction, which is also not a value question. It is easy to just extract verbs, but not everything can be extracted, so a filter must be applied.
[nisbot.icon]Value
[nishio.icon] And well, after thinking this far, I decided that the first of the five that should be done is movement extraction. Because it will have a positive effect on the way to proceed in the early stage by increasing keyword extraction. The next is a mechanism to play the keywords that are not good. This improves the quality of keywords and reduces the likelihood of stumbling in the early stages.
[nisbot.icon]Early stages
[nishio.icon]The early stage of the design has not been verbalized with clear actions. I think it's a good idea to try to verbalize it again after the first two are done. And if you come up with something, implement it, and if not, proceed to the end design.
[nisbot.icon]Early stages
[nishio.icon] Improvement of the naturalness determination of questions is pending, but I'm okay with putting it off until later because the training data is growing just by leaving it alone.
[nisbot.icon]Question
[nishio.icon]The End
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I wanted the tasks to be organized, but the objective was achieved because I knew what to do first and next.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that task?
