Toulmin Model
[Discussion] [Model].
	Describes what kind of arguments and counter-arguments are good for a good debate.
	It was born as a criticism of arguments based on formal logic.

Claims are supported by Data and Warrant
	The translation could be confusing.
	Data is an observed fact
	Warrant is subjective, such as interpretation of observed facts and assumptions
		People often forget to explain the assumptions behind their claims (implicit assumptions)
		When there are discrepancies in these assumptions, we can look at the same facts and come to different conclusions.
	These three things should be clear.

Add three elements
	Backing
		Provide evidence (Data) that the warrant is valid.
	Rebuttal
		I feel uncomfortable with the translation...
		Indicate the conditions under which the claim is not valid.
		Declare "except in this case" to the expected objections in advance.
	Qualifier
		State the degree of certainty of your claim

How to make a good claim with all six in place.

rebuttal
　Rebuttal
　Point out the errors in Data/Warrant. Not against the claim.
　Questions (Question)
　Ask questions of Data/Warrant and seek additional arguments. Not against the claim.
　Refutation (Antithese)
　Making a Different Claim
		Good claim with all six in place.
