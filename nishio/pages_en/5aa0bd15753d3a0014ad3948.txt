Information and Knowledge
Organize how you use them differently.

	[Information] is separate from people and can circulate independently of them.
 	data
  fact
  Text from the book
	[Knowledge] is tightly coupled to specific individuals and difficult to distribute in isolation
 	The work of detachment is, for example, the writing of a book.
  	Significant costs involved.
   It will take a while again for the recipients of that information to make use of it.
 	Individuals distributing themselves and
  Hard to scale

I sometimes use it wrong myself, so I'll fix it as soon as I realize it.

Knowledge" and "information" in this distinction correspond to "[tacit knowledge]" and "[formal knowledge]" in Ikujiro Nonaka's [SECI Model].
