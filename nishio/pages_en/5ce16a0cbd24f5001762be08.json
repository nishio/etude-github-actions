1: 集合
	Let [$ \Gamma] be [index] [set family].
	[妥当式]
	Any set can be expressed as [$ S = \{x \in U | \phi(x) \} ] using some logical formula [$ \phi
		[分出公理]

2: [濃度]
	[Cantorの定理]
	[$ |N| < |P(N)| ]
		[There exists no A such that [$ |N| < |A| < |P(N)| ].
			Proven "not provable from [ZFC]."
3: [Bernstein's theorem].
	Let sets A and B be infinite sets; if there is a 1:1 correspondence f from A to a subset of B and a 1:1 correspondence g from B to a subset of A, then there is a 1:1 correspondence between A and B
4: [公理的集合論]
5: [選択公理]
6: [Weierstrauss theorem].
	If a subset A of R is bounded above, then there exists an upper bound sup A of A. If A is bounded below, then there exists a lower bound inf A of A.
7, 8: Composition of [real numbers] by [Cauchy sequence
	[収束列]
	Cauchy column
		[$ \forall \varepsilon > 0 \quad \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \quad \forall p, q \in \mathbb{N} \quad(p > q > N → |a_p - a_q| < \varepsilon) ]
	Convergent columns are Cauchy columns
	That a Cauchy sequence is a convergent sequence is shown in 13.3 using [superquasi-analysis
	Use a Cauchy sequence consisting of rational numbers to construct real numbers
	[Rational Cauchy Sequence]
		[$ \forall \epsilon \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \quad \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \quad \forall p, q \in \mathbb{N} \quad(p > q > N → |a_p - a_q| < \varepsilon) ]
  Let [$ \mathbb{Q}^\# ] be the set of rational Cauchy sequences
 有理コーシー列a_n, b_nに対して[$ \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n - b_n) = 0] は同値関係
 	We can create a quotient set with this equivalence relation from a set of favorable Cauchy sequences.
 	This set looks like real numbers.
 [順序体]
 	Use with 10
9: [Flesch filter].
	filter (esp. camera)
		A family [$ F \subset P(N)] of subsets of the whole set N of natural numbers is called a filter on N if F satisfies the following conditions
			1:[$ N \in F]
			2: [$ 0 \notin F] 
			3: [$ (A \in F \wedge A \subset B) \to B \in F]
				Sets with subsets that are contained in the filter are contained in the filter
			4: [$ (A \in F \wedge B \in F) \to A \cap B \in F]
				The common subset of the two sets contained in the filter is contained in the filter
		In addition, if the following conditions are met, it is called a super filter
			5: [$ \forall A \subset N (A \in F \vee A^c \in F)]
				For any subset A, A is contained in F or the complement of A
					Can [nishio.icon]both be included?
						If both A and the complement of A are contained, then by (4) their common subset 0 is also contained in F, but this violates (2). Therefore, both cannot be included.

	[Frecher Filter]
	[$ \mathcal{F}_0 = \{ A \subset \mathbb{N} | A^c が有限集合 \}]


	From a set of real sequences, create a quotient set by equivalence relations using [Fréchet filter].
	Used to define [inequality].
	[ultrafilter].
10: Composition of [hyperreal numbers
11: [超自然数]
	[無限大数]
		A hyperreal number r such that [$ |r|>n] for any standard natural number n is called an infinite number.
	[無限小数]
		A hyperreal number r such that [$ |r|<1/n] for any standard natural number n is called an infinite fraction
		Existence of non-zero infinitesimals
			例: [$ [(1, 1/2, 1/3, \ldots)]]
			Need [$ \{n+1, n+2, \ldots\} \in \mathcal{F}] to say that this is an infinite fraction
			定理D.4 p.106
				When F is a superfilter on N, "F contains no finite set" and "F contains F0" are equivalent
				F0 means Freshet filter
				Definition of Flesché filter p.38
				[$ \mathcal{F}_0 = \{ A \subset \mathbb{N} | A^c が有限集合 \}]
				The proof itself is simple.
				If we can show that "the ultrafilter contains F0", we can say [$ \{n+1, n+2, \ldots\} \in \mathcal{F}
					Because the complement set is a finite set.
			For a while, I was wondering "How can we show that the super filter contains F0?
				The idea was backwards, the super filter does not necessarily include F0
			Theorem D.5 "For any filter F there exists a superfilter containing F"
				There can be more than one super filter.
				Indicates "the existence of a superfilter containing the Fréchet filter F0."
				For this proof we use [Zorn's Corollary

	[near infinite].
		When x-y is an infinite fraction, x and y are "near infinite".
	[Monad]
		For some real number x, the set of near-infinite hyperreal numbers y is called the monad of x
12, 13: 数列の[極限]
	[$ \epsilon-\delta]を使わずに定義
	[$ \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a]
	[$ \forall n \in *\mathbb{N}_\infty (*a_n \approx a) ]
		For an infinite natural number n, a_n is infinitely close to a
