 *1380866118*Kyoto University Summer Design School lecture materials are now available.
 We held a design workshop at <a href='http://www.design.kyoto-u.ac.jp/summer-school2013/ja/index.html'>Kyoto University Summer Design School 2013</a> from September 25 to 27, 2013! The lecture materials have been uploaded on Slideshare. The lecture materials were uploaded to Slideshare, but since there are 14 of them, we created a page with links to each of the lecture materials. Here: <a href='http://nhiro.org/kuds2013/'>"Designing Teamwork" lecture materials</a>.
 
 The flow of the course is to think about solutions to specific problems you are facing through repeated lectures and exercises. The subject is "Designing Teamwork," but I think the principles can be applied to any field. In fact, I used it when I wrote <a href='http://nhiro.org/langbook/'>"The Technology Behind Coding"</a>.
