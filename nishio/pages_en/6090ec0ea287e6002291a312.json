 *1421425021*Experimental conversation with him 1
 The purpose of this article is not to share the experimental log accurately, but to verify that the experimental log may be surprisingly interesting as content, so I have removed uninteresting parts and modified it slightly to make it easier to read.
 
 **experiment 1 1/15/2015 17:47
 
 What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
 >>> I would like to clarify more about what memory is.
 What happens just before that?
 >>> New information input occurs just before memory
 Is that information the same as memory? Is it different?
 >>> The information is original, but a bit doctored.
 Where can I find that information?
 >>> Information is outside of you and you take it in by reading it.
 What is between you and that thing?
 >>> Dare I say, a willingness to take in positive information.
 What happens to the posture at the time of that information?
 >>> I'm sure your attitude is positive when you come across interesting information.
 What type of positive is that positive?
 >>> Attitude of wanting to get more information
 How many of these information do you have?
 >>> Countless.
 Is that attitude the same as just before? Is it different?
 >>> "Immediately before" is a temporal relationship, not a thing.
 What type of relationship is that relationship?
 
 
 Findings: If keywords are selected only from the immediately preceding statement, the conversation will go off track, so it is necessary to restore the conversation as appropriate.
 
 ** Experimental 2 1/15/2015 18:39
 
 What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
 >> I need more clarity on listening.
 Is there anything else about that listening?
 >>> Listening is the best way to get information out of them.
 Is there anything else about that information?
 >>> Some information is useful and some is not. I want to bring out useful information.
 Then what happens?
 >>> If you can elicit useful information, you can improve your activities.
 What happens next?
 >>> When one's activities are improved, good results can be achieved and good evaluations can be obtained.
 How far away is that partner?
 >>> Well, unlike family members who are around all the time, you should consider that the time you have to talk is limited.
 What is the connection between this information and the family?
 >>> Nothing.
 How many of these information do you have?
 >>> Information is innumerable.
 What type of usefulness is that usefulness?
 >>> the kind of usefulness that would help me improve my activities.
 What happens just before that?
 >>> "I see, that's the way to do it.
 What happens in the evaluation when you are in that role?
 >>> When they are useful, they will be appreciated.
 Where is the improvement?
 >>> Where is the improvement, dare I say it, in my own mind?
 What happens to the other party when that happens?
 >>> If you dare to interpret what is being asked as "when useful information is elicited, helpful, and appreciated as a result of listening," then the other person should be thanked and the other person should get the satisfaction of having been helpful to others.
 How far away is that information?
 >>> Hey, hey, hey, respond to what I said just before.
 
 
 Findings: When we simply accumulated the words that appeared, the probability of selecting a word that was included in the previous answer gradually decreased, giving the impression that the respondents were not listening to us properly.
 
 ** Experimental 3 1/15/2015 18:58
 
 What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
 >>> Clarification of listening
 Then what happens?
 >> Software to assist in listening can be
 Where is that support located?
 >>> It goes on everyone's computer and is always available.
 What is the connection between that computer and listening?
 >>> There are programs that allow computers to listen and clarification of what listening is.
 Then what happens?
 >>> Better knowledge distribution will occur in cases where knowledge distribution has been hampered by the inability to verbalize.
 Where does that listening come from?
 >>> The desire to know
 What are those guys like?
 >>> Members of a company or other organization
 Is the feeling inside? Is it outside?
 >>> Inside
 How old is that software?
 >>> I'm just starting to move w
 Is there anything else you can tell us about that area?
 >>> We are just starting to move, now we have to find problems and solutions to improve.
 That way, what are you wearing?
 >>> I'm not wearing it.
 Is the solution inside? Is it outside?
 >>> Hmmm, it comes from inside, but the solution itself is not complete inside. The solution itself is outside, because the solution is to combine with the outside world and change the outside world.
 Where is that world?
 >>> The outside world is outside of you, all around you.
 What happens just before that?
 >>> Just before the world changes, there is action to change
 Where is that bonding?
 >>> The union of the inside world and the outside world is on your own boundaries.
 How many of these selves do you have?
 >>> One.
 Where is the solution?
 
 
 Findings: It would be better to add "that" only if it is included in the immediately preceding utterance.
 
 ** Experimental 4 1/16/2015 18:03
 
 What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
 I> I've loaded the duplicate question elimination, NG question determination, and question stage determination, and I want to test it.
 He> How do you know that question?
 I> I know because this program will put the question out on the console.
 he> exclusion seems to be what?
 I> I was going to do a logistic regression, but I thought I'd start with something simple, so just a blacklist.
 he> Exclusion is what kind of exclusion?
 I> Keep a list of questions and word pairs that the user answered NG, and cancel if the same one appears.
 he> What kind of question is that?
 I> Question displayed by this program
 He> Where is that question?
 I> It's showing up on the console.
 He> The question seems to be, what?
 I> hmmm, like shaking things up when they get stuck.
 He> Is there anything else about the question?
 I> think a program that asks questions would be beneficial.
 he > console is what kind of console?
 I> General computer-human interface
 he> What does that interface look like?
 I> It looks like a chat right now, but I'm hoping to quit this kind of turn-based movement in the near future. I want to determine from input time and typing speed how much the user is struggling to reply.
 he> What type of cancellation is it?
 Me> I'll remove it from the list of options.
 He> Where is the interface?
 I> between human and computer.
 he> What type of computer is that?
 Me> An ordinary laptop. If the program requires a very powerful machine, it would not be easy for individual users to use.
 He> Is there anything else about the interface?
 I think it would be better to move toward something that current users are familiar with, such as Facebook or Twitter.
 He> How do you know the user?
 I> Maybe a closed beta test, and then a limited release to those who applied.
 He> How do you know its closed?
 I> I know because I'm the organizer, but how do users know, well, from my Facebook and Twitter posts?
 he> What kind of user is that user?
 I> Eventually, I'd like it to be usable by everyone, but for now, I'd like to have a very small number of users who give me feedback.
 he> what does that user seem to be?
 Me> I guess it's a litmus test.
 He> Is there anything else about that litmus?
 Me> No, you'd have to give me more detailed feedback back.
 He> Twitter is like what?
 I> Twitter is a place where you can post short sentences and talk to yourself.
 he> What kind of Twitter is that Twitter?
 I> So-called social networking sites.
 He> How do you know about that social networking site?
 I> Naturally.
 He> Where is Twitter?
 I> on the Internet
 He> Is there anything else about Facebook?
 I> Facebook is also a kind of social networking site, which is on the Internet.
 He> Is there anything else about that internet?
 I> users are connected through it.
 He> Where is Facebook?
 I> On the Internet.
 he> feedback seems to be what?
 I> Food for growing the program.
 He> Is there anything else about that sustenance?
 I> clarify where the house needs to be improved.
 he > program seems to be what?
 
 
 Findings: Weighted by IDF. Litmus test paper" is split into "litmus" and "test paper." Key phrase extraction is needed instead of keyword extraction. There is a bug in the state transition and it is not working correctly.
 
 ** Experimental 5 1/17/2015 0:59
 
 What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
 I> need some new ideas about this conversation program.
 he> How do you know about the idea?
 I> notice an unexpected blind spot by being questioned by the program here, and know from there
 He> How do you know about that blind spot?
 I> When you asked the question, I thought, "Ha, I never thought about that.
 He> conversation is like what?
 Me> Like a ping-pong rally.
 He> What type of conversation is the conversation?
 I> The computer asks me questions incessantly, and I type them back incessantly.
 He> Where is Larry located?
 I> between human and computer.
 he> Where is that computer located?
 I> Right in front of you.
 he> idea seems to be what?
 I> It's like a new sprout, and it grows from there.
 he> What type of growth is that?
 I> When I notice something and think about it, I notice a new blind spot and think about it again, and so on and so forth, getting bigger and bigger.
 he> Where is that blind spot?
 I> The blind spot is in the human being.
 He> Is there anything else you can tell us about computers?
 Me> An ordinary laptop. If the program requires a very powerful machine, it would not be easy for individual users to use.
 he> blind spot seems to be what?
 Me> Tough question, but the first thing that comes to mind is a black hole.
 he> What kind of holes are those?
 I> I can't see inside.
 He> How do you know what is normal?
 Me> What do you mean by normal, oh you mean a normal laptop. That means it's available at a reasonable price.
 He> How do you know its a laptop?
 I> It doesn't have to be a laptop, but I imagine it as a computer that can be easily used. So an iPhone or something like that would be fine. If the processing power is sufficient, such mobile devices are superior in terms of ease of use.
 He> Where is that laptop?
 I> The laptop I was envisioning now feels like it's always with the human being.
 he> does that laptop have a location?
 I> Well, right in front of me
 he> Which direction is the laptop?
 I> It's in the front, facing the human side.
 He> Is the laptop inside or outside? Outside?
 I> Outside
 he > laptop is what kind of laptop?
 I> I initially envisioned a Dell laptop with Windows that I have been using recently for company reasons.
 He> How many of those laptops do you have?
 Me> Usually one at a time.
 He> What is it that you value?
 Me> I guess what I've found valuable so far is the ideas, the blind spots, the growth, and then the program that asks the questions.
 he> Does that question have a size or shape?
 I> No.
 How far away is he> laptop?
 I> Physically, we are close enough to reach, but in terms of proximity to humans, we are too far away to be human.
 he> How old is that human being?
 I> I've been here for about 30 years.
 He> What kind of human being are you?
 I> the kind of person who is expected to produce ideas.
 he> Where do you get that idea?
 Me> Well, maybe around the head.
 He> How long has the program been in place?
 I just started making it yesterday.
 he> Do humans have a size or shape?
 I> Well, in moderation.
 He> What is it that you value?
 I> Ideas, blind spots, growth, programs that ask questions.
 he> What does that program look like?
 I> Counselor.
 He> Does a human being have a position?
 I> NG Why don't you use the new keyword "counselor" there?
 He> What does that counselor seem to be?
 I> patiently wait for them to figure out the answer on their own, just like an elementary school teacher
 He> What is it that you value?
 I> ideas, blind spots, growth, programs that ask questions, counselors, teachers, perseverance, answers
 He> How do you know its growing?
 I> It's the growth of blind spots, uh, you know, when you notice a blind spot and you're thinking about it and you notice a new blind spot, "Oh, I didn't notice this.
 He> How many of those blind spots are there?
 I> There are innumerable.
 he> What kind of blind spots are they?
 Me> In this example, a feature that is missing from this program. For example, in the example I noticed yesterday, the problem of repeating the same question, or now, when the word "blind spot" is mentioned, I already forgot what I said, so if the word is from a distant sentence, the sentence needs to be restated, or something like that.
 He> Is there anything else you can tell us about that blind spot?
 Me> Hmmm, I wonder if it would be possible to enter "don't use that as a keyword" or "let's use this as a keyword" in the form of a command.
 He> What is it that you value?
 Me> This question has come up many times. Ideas, blind spots, growth, programs that ask questions, counselors, teachers, perseverance, answers.
 He> Where is that patience?
 I> Inside the mind of a teacher
 Does he> word have a position?
 I> Keywords don't have a position. I'd need to make it a key phrase, not a keyword.
 He> Is there anything else you can tell us about the teacher?
 I think it is important for teachers to play the role of bringing out the students' independent behavior and awareness, rather than the preconceived notion that teachers are supposed to teach or provide input to the students.
 He> perseverance is in which direction?
 I> Well, in the direction to go up.
 He> word is like what?
 I> keywords are like hooks, without them, they are elusive.
 He> Teachers wear what?
 I> Normal clothes
 He> How do you know the Word?
 I> How do I know what the keywords are? Well, if I am asked to list the keywords, I can't, and if I am asked to speak something, it is difficult, but if I am asked a question, I can verbalize what I am thinking more easily than those, and when I see the verbalization in front of me, I can immediately tell what words used in it are important keywords. I also get annoyed when people ask me questions about things that are not keywords, because I feel like they are missing the point.
 He> How do you know the language?
 I> "Linguization" has been split up. I still need to fix that first.
 He> Which direction is the word?
 
 
 Findings: Urgent need to change keyword extraction to key phrase extraction.
 
 *1421427974* with keyphrase extraction
 he> What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
 I> changed to keyphrase extraction instead of keyword extraction and would like to check its operation.
 he> how do you know its a key phrase extraction?
 I> I used to morphologically analyze the nouns and take them out and weight them by IDF, but in this version I decided to combine them if they are consecutive nouns.
 He> What is it that you value?
 I> Key phrase extraction.
 He> Is there anything else about morphological analysis?
 I> I'm using KyTea in this case, but for example, "litmus test paper" is treated as a suffix only for "paper". So I wrote code to combine the suffix immediately after the noun as part of the noun.
 he> what does that noun immediately after seem to be?
 I> Ahhh, I'll just stick with that...
 He> KyTea is like what?
 I> MeCab felt like a tool, but KyTea feels like a living thing that is grown up with partial annotations.
 he> keyword extraction seems to be what?
 I> It worked okay as a first prototype, but as I used it, I realized that it was not good enough at all.
 he> Where is the key phrase extraction?
 I> When I receive input from a human, I immediately turn it over to keyphrase extraction. No, it's a different route if it's prefixed with NG exactly.
 He> What is it that you value?
 I> KyTea and keyphrase extraction and that this program will be improved.
 (Program has crashed.)
 
 *1421504944*Consideration of improvement plans, Reflection on Artificial Brain
 he> What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
 I> want to talk about ideas for improving this program and be asked questions about them to organize my thoughts and find new ideas.
 He> How will you know about the proposed improvements?
 I> Regarding which part of the user's utterance is extracted as the key phrase, in the first version, it was extracted only from the immediately preceding utterance and selected randomly, but since that would lead to more and more off-topic conversations, in the next version, it was randomly selected including past utterances, and since that would lead to a lower and lower probability of being selected from the immediately preceding utterance The next version will include past utterances and randomly select them, and since the probability of being selected from the most recent utterances is decreasing rapidly, I added an Ebbinghaus forgetting curve and weighted them with IDF so that the higher the score, the more likely they are to be selected.
 he> just before that seems to be what?
 I> The previous statement is exactly what I just heard, and if I don't respond as if I've heard it properly, the user will feel unresponsive.
 he> What kind of wind is that wind?
 Me> I can feel that the other person is taking in what they are saying.
 he> What type of utterance is the utterance?
 I> In response to the user's answer to the question,
 He> Where is the utterance?
 I> I was going to write that it is the user's response to a question, and the longer it is, the more evidence that the listening is going well, but I failed. The speech comes into the program as input.
 He> Is there anything else about that utterance?
 I> It is important to choose appropriate key phrases and ask questions so that the utterance is longer.
 He> Is there anything else about listening?
 I> Since listening is the value that this program provides to the user, I think it would be a good idea to first identify a scale to quantitatively measure listening and then multiply the optimization on that scale.
 He> speech is like what?
 I> The utterance is like juice squeezed out of the fruit of the user. The question is what is being squeezed.
 He> What type of input is the input?
 Me> Currently, I type by tapping on the keyboard, sort of like chatting. Some people like voice input, but I think that is a low priority path.
 he> what is that keyboard like?
 I> When I think of a tool to spell out thoughts, it is like a pen.
 He> How do you know the path?
 Me> Well, the choice and concentration on keyboard input instead of voice input is not a particularly well-founded choice.
 He> Where is the user?
 I > am in front of a computer. For the time being, you can assume that I am the user.
 he> What type of voice input?
 I> ng I don't want to delve into your side of the story.
 He> Listening is like what?
 I> The process of finding appropriate key phrases in the user's speech and prompting more speech by asking questions about them, like digging for potatoes, pulling interconnected ideas out of the soil while being careful not to break the vines.
 he> Where is that key phrase?
 I> The key phrase is in the user's utterance, and the key issue at hand is to determine where the key phrase is.
 he> What kind of key phrase is that key phrase?
 I> Right now, I'm using morphological analysis to extract words and then combining nouns to create key phrases, but as a result, the score sticks to the upper limit for those that do not appear in the IDF dictionary. We need another way of scoring, and that score will correlate to "how long the user returns a response".
 he> Is there anything else about that key phrase?
 I> score them from the features of the constituent words and n-grams using a method like logistic regression or passive aggressive. Oh, and key phrases in the immediately preceding utterance should be given special treatment and high priority. Also, as I was writing this, I just realized that if I have a series of nouns, I have only one key phrase that I have attached to all of them, but with "key phrase in the immediately preceding utterance", I want to calculate the score for the entire subsequence, not just "in the immediately preceding utterance" as the key phrase.
 he> What does that key phrase seem to be?
 I> It looks like a hook, and you hook it with that hook and pull it out.
 he> Where are the key phrases?
 I> Although directly in the user's input, all past utterances are connected on the network via a common key phrase, and the key phrase is the string that connects the individual utterances, and key phrases that appear only in one utterance are not that important. Key phrases of the type that appear many times and connect together aspects described in several utterances are important. So the idea that the key phrase is in the utterance is not appropriate. It is more appropriate to think of them as being between the utterances, loosely covering the utterances.
 he> How do you know that key phrase?
 I> I can tell what the program recognizes as a key phrase by what question it returns. Is there a way to tell the program when its perception is incorrect?
 He> Where are your thoughts?
 I> The idea that key phrases are in the utterance is in the assumption that comes from having written a process to extract key phrases from an utterance.
 He> Is there anything else you can tell us about the user?
 I> Users enjoy answering appropriate questions, and they respond to them quickly and easily. So, if we measure that, we should be able to measure whether the question was appropriate or not. I think it is important to make it a real-time chat program, not a turn-based dialogue program, and to take the input time or something as a feature value.
 He> How do you know its turnaround time?
 I> I chose the turn-based system simply because it was the easiest to implement. I thought from the beginning that it was not essential. It's not hard to make it real-time either, since you basically just have to wait for the human to speak.
 He> on its implementation, what is it like?
 Me> It's a common mistake. The mistake of choosing implementation based on what is easy for you, rather than what will lead to value for the customer.
 He> Where is the scoring?
 I> In the current implementation, there is a function that takes the input, analyzes it morphologically, and then takes the morphological sequence and updates the score and other "environment". Scoring key phrases was the first job of that function, but now it has been extended to take on managing the flow of dialogue with state transitions.
 he> how do you know its state transitions?
 Me> Right now I'm hard-coding with Metaphors in Mind as a reference.
 He> Is there anything else you can tell us about the turn system?
 Me> It's simple, now we interpret a user pressing Enter in the input field as an immediate pronouncement of a turn end, but that is not the case in real real-time chat. When you are starting to write a continuation, when the conversation is not complete, it is not a turn end. Starting to write a continuation can be easily taken by changing the interface to HTML+JS or something else instead of a CUI application.
 he> What type of hardcoding is hardcoding?
 I> There is a variable that holds the current state, and the code implements what state to transition to when certain conditions are met in a certain state.
 He> Is there anything else about that condition?
 I> The problem is that there is no verification that the conditions are really appropriate, especially for parameterized types of conditions. If there is enough data, it may be possible to adjust automatically.
 he> What type of conditions are those?
 I> Specifically, for example, if the number of key phrases extracted exceeds a certain amount.
 he> What kind of constant amount is that constant amount?
 Me> Now it's a feeling-based decision. In fact, once I made it too big, the expected transitions were not always easy to happen. It is the same now. Oh, and the other reason is that we changed to keyphrase extraction compared to the days when it was keyword extraction, so the number extracted is decreasing, but we haven't adjusted to that. If we change the keyphrase substring to be a keyphrase in the future, the number of extraction will be much larger this time.
 he> Where is that extraction number?
 I> Simply, there is a variable that accumulates the key phrases that have come up so far and their scores, and I look at the size of that variable.
 he> What kind of subsequence is a subsequence?
 I> for key phrases consisting of multiple words.
 He> Is there anything else you can tell us about the function?
 I> I have a bad keyboard... like the Enter key being pressed twice. ...... is terrible. I think you mean that for a keyphrase that consists of multiple words, any phrase that can be taken out of that column should also be a keyphrase. I guess the function was about updating the environment. Other than that...I feel like I'm taking on too many functions. But this is a hot spot, so I don't think it's a good idea to mess around right now. I believe that state updates are hard-coded now, but will eventually turn into matrices. Deterministic transitions are just a special form of stochastic transitions, and I'm thinking of a model where the internal state transitions stochastically due to external input, and the output to the outside world is stochastically determined by that state, and currently the first half of the state is deterministic and the second half is stochastic, but the first half is also stochastic. It is appropriate, and it would be represented by a transition matrix.
 He> Is there anything else you can tell us about that twice push?
 Me> NG Let's not delve into that topic.
 he> what is that twice push like?
 I> NG I still need the "Let's not do that" command. As a command to reduce the score of the key phrase used to create the immediately preceding question.
 he> What kind of stochastic is that stochastic?
 I> The probability model that determines the output of the current program is simple: once the state is determined, the multiple question templates that can be output in that state are determined, the key phrases to be embedded in the question templates are extracted separately, and the set of direct products from which the "already asked questions" and "NG registered questions" are removed. The sampling will be.
 He> Where is the probabilistic?
 I> Now it is hard coded in a function that returns output.
 He> Is there anything else about probabilistic?
 I> This is also hard coded now, but I think it could be a matrix of output probabilities. If I did my best to create teacher data from the conversation examples in the document, I'd end up with a hidden Markov model parameter estimation problem. I don't want to do it because it's too much trouble and I don't think it will improve customer value. It is better to gradually become smarter while using the system on a daily basis than to try hard to create teacher data and train the system.
 he> Where is that hard code?
 I> In a function that returns output.
 he> what does the teacher data look like?
 I> Burden. Maybe it's a personality problem, but I don't have the patience, so I don't really like methods that say that if you work hard to prepare the teacher data in advance, the performance will improve.
 He> Is there anything else about deterministic?
 I> The old artifacts were roughly deterministic. The output was a fixed set of words when a keyword was matched. Later, however, some were able to map multiple outputs to a single keyword, and in that case, they were implemented in such a way that the outputs were randomly sampled from the set of outputs that matched the keyword. In hindsight, that may have been the fork in the road from deterministic to probabilistic dialogue.
 he> What kind of artificial anencephalon is that artificial anencephalon?
 I> It has pairs of keywords and outputs for them, and if a keyword is found in the user's input, it produces the corresponding output. To explain the comparison with this system, the keyphrase extraction part is replaced by string pattern matching of pre-registered keywords
 He> Where is the transition?
 I> As far as I just explained, the old anencephalon does not have state transitions. The artificial anencephalon I created when I was in junior high school was slightly improved in this respect, and since the target of string pattern matching was extended to the program's speech itself, and since I prepared a syntax for embedding invisible labels, I was able to describe internal state transitions while retaining the traditional data format framework of keyword/output pairs. transitions could be described while maintaining the framework of the conventional data format of keyword-output pairs. Whereas the previous artificial anencephalon only responded to stimuli in a single shot and had no memory, my framework made it possible to describe an interaction consisting of multiple outputs.
 he> Where is that output located?
 I> The keywords were described in the data file in a one-to-one correspondence with the keywords.
 He> Is there anything else about hard codes?
 I> In that sense, the artificial anencephalon did not hard-code any probability model. Everything was pushed to the data side, and the system side was dedicated to providing a descriptive language with enough expressive power to describe state transitions.
 He> What does that artificial anencephalon seem to be?
 Me> You are a child. The more knowledge you give them, the more they grow and become smarter. But anyway, the approach that if you increase the amount of data, it should get smarter gradually began to saturate the feeling of getting smarter per additional data effort. Like Dr. Tenma who created Atom, I lost my love for him when I realized that Atom, whom I thought was my child, did not grow up.
 he> What type of data volume is that?
 Me> the amount of data created by direct manual input by humans. So it's the equivalent of training data in what you just said, and it's a burden. But at the time, we didn't have the idea of generalized performance, so we didn't know how to scale the amount of data that could be processed beyond the input.
 He> Is there anything else you can tell us about artificial anencephaly?
 I> In terms of programs whose main purpose is to interact with humans, I think that the number of users who have had interactive experiences with Siri, Talking Consultant, etc. has increased considerably. However, I think that the artificial brain boom 20 years ago was not about "having a fun conversation with an artificial personality created and given by Apple," but about "each individual being able to implement a virtual personality of their own choice and create their own artificial brain" as a customer value. I think the important point is that there are users who find value in creating and nurturing their own virtual personality, rather than talking to a custom-made one.
 he> Where is that artificial anencephalon located?
 I> There was a time when there were chat rooms on the Internet, well, CGI written in Perl, so it was easy to set up and modify, and that guy had an artificial brain. I see, chat rooms for young people nowadays are Skype and LINE. If so, it is not so easy to install an artificial brain.
 
 Findings: I think we're getting away from our original purpose. To summarize what might be useful in light of the original purpose:.
 - There is no particular rationale for avoiding voice input and focusing on keyboard input.
 - I used to think that "key phrases are in the user's utterances," but this was an unfounded assumption to which I was preoccupied. By rethinking it as "key phrases are in between utterances," I realized that the role of key phrases is to link multiple utterances, and that the number of occurrences across utterances is the essentially important measure, but I'm not using it now.
 - Also, if an inappropriate key phrase is chosen, the user can notice it, and there should be a means to teach the program to notice it
 - In order to do our original plan of "creating a model to select appropriate key phrases by machine learning so that the length of the user's utterance will be longer," we thought it would be better to be able to capture the user's input time, so the first priority is to change the UI to a real-time chat format.
 I guess.
