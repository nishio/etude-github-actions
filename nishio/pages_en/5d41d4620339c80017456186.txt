tone policing
In situations where a minority is emotionally offended by the actions of the majority, the minority is deprived of the means to explain the situation when the majority insists that the minority "stop emotionalism" in response to the minority's explanation of "the situation in which their feelings are being offended".

>When people who are discriminated against or oppressed try to express their pain, grief, and anger, the discriminators and the privileged criticize not the content of the story, but the emotions attached to it, which has the effect of silencing, disempowering, and shielding them from the appeal.

>Of course, tone-policing to keep the victim's mouth shut is a no-no.
> But criticizing opinion leaders who pontificate and use derogatory language about those with whom they disagree is not the same as shutting the mouth of the victim.
