It was interesting and I made a note of it.

While there are interpretations like this, my interpretation is that
	(including whether or not to obey the opinions of others in the form of commands).
 Responsibility for the consequences of one's own will is self-responsibility.
 There are those who think, "I followed an authority figure's opinion, so it's not right that I should be held accountable."
 It's used solely in the form of "You made the decision to follow your own will" to such people.
It is interesting to see the subject assumed in reverse.
