intrusive advice
Let's do a ChatGPT imitation of all the intrusive advice."

>[takkanm https://twitter.com/takkanm/status/1643395200021151748] I'm out of allergy medicine, so I'm using a rhinitis spray to get by, but it doesn't help with the skin rash...

>[yotii23 https://twitter.com/yotii23/status/1643399774325071872] You may already know this, but it worked for me...

>[takkanm https://twitter.com/takkanm/status/1643409844869951488] (except that I'm not in the habit of wearing it at all) Ok!

>[yotii23 https://twitter.com/yotii23/status/1643417087032045573] I recommend incorporating this into your morning face washing routine.

>[takkanm https://twitter.com/takkanm/status/1643423810081939456] I'm an old man with a full beard who washes his face in the morning with water and that's it....

>[yotii23 https://twitter.com/yotii23/status/1643427913126281216] I'm going to imitate ChatGPT now.

> I see. So you wash your face in the morning with water and that's it?
> We recommend the following actions
> 1. Now take the exterior of the UV milk, open the seal, and put it on your face. The psychological cost of once-experienced behavior is lower, so the effect of doing it once is expected.
> 2. Always place UV milk in a place where it can be seen and reached after washing face.
> 3. Be conscious of applying UV milk immediately after washing and wiping your face. If you forget, start over from washing your face as soon as you remember.
> 
> Habituation can be achieved by reducing the cost of behavior and repetition. Please try to prevent skin irritation caused by pollen.

>[_ko1 https://twitter.com/_ko1/status/1643431481476526080] I was going to try and give you some intrusive advice, but I didn't have enough intrusive advice power.

>[yotii23 https://twitter.com/yotii23/status/1643435641911545858] You feel that you lack the ability to give intrusive advice.
> It is difficult to evaluate yourself objectively. Therefore, we recommend the following method.
> 
> 1. ask your close partner if he/she has ever received intrusive advice from you.
> 2. If they answer "yes," ask them what kind of advice they thought so. Also, ask them to point out on the spot if they receive such advice in the future.
> 3. If they answer "no," ask them to point it out on the spot if they receive such advice in the future.
> 4. List the details pointed out.

>[yotii23 https://twitter.com/yotii23/status/1643435830529396736] Gathering objective opinions will help you understand who you have been and also improve your ability to give intrusive advice based on your opinions.

>[_ko1 https://twitter.com/_ko1/status/1643436119118462977] Please format your answer now into a conversation format at McDonald's by a high school girl.

>[yotii23 https://twitter.com/yotii23/status/1643445080395767809] Okay. I will try.
> 
> A high school girl next to me at McDonald's said, "Some guys say I give advice but I don't push it, so they don't hate me, but everyone just goes through the motions because it's too much trouble. There's no such thing as advice that isn't intrusive in the first place," she said.
