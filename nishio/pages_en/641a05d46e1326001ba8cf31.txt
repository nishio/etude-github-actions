>[alfredplpl https://twitter.com/alfredplpl/status/1638331863558414336] I consider GPT a mirror of knowledge. I believe that the mirror of knowledge is a reflection of our own intelligence. Many people are confused, but I think it is because this mirror of knowledge has never existed before, just as animals are confused by mirrors. I believe that the mirror of knowledge works to supplement one's intelligence.
