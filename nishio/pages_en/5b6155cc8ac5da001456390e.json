The Problem of Technical Figurative Expression
	The technical term is sometimes used figuratively among those who know the technology.
 	Both parties know the technical meaning of the term, and both understand that it's being used outside of its original application.
 To someone who does not share that technology, it appears to be a technical term, not a figurative expression
 	Misleading as to technical support.
  Words speak for themselves.
  After walking alone, experts who know the technology and do not share the context point out that the use of the technology is wrong.
  For someone who doesn't understand the technology, "Expert A says it's X, so I believed it, and then Expert B says it's not X. What does that mean?" What does that mean?
  I sometimes feel like they're trying to "smoke me out with technical jargon."

I almost said [impedance mismatch] in the context of trying to talk about the need to reconcile technology with existing systems, and then I thought, "Wait, isn't this not what the supposed reader gets?" I thought back.
