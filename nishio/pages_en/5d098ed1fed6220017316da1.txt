What to do today
	>A daily task list is a "list of things I plan to do today". But that would be "a list of things to do today" in common parlance.
	>In fact, the general "list of things to do today" is also "a list of things I think should be done today," and has little or nothing to do with the "should" that the world demands in principle.

	What you should do today" is an interpretation, not a fact. [Distinction between facts and interpretations].
		[shouldâ†’why?]
		What would happen if [should -> not]?
