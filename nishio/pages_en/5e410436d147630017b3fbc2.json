	>The bus ticket theory also suggests ways to avoid [age-related stalling]. Perhaps the reason people stop coming up with new ideas as they age is not just that they lose their sharpness. Besides, it is because once you have established yourself, you can no longer get involved in side projects that you are not responsible for, unlike when you were younger and no one cared what you did.

		> The solution is obvious: stay ---- [irresponsible]. But it will be difficult. Because to an outsider, the glaringly unplanned projects you have taken up to arrest the decline can be read as evidence of it. And you yourself will not be sure if they are wrong. But at least you will have more fun working on what you want to do.

		> The solution to that is obvious: remain irresponsible. It will be hard, though, because the apparently random projects you take up to stave off decline will read to outsiders as evidence of it. And you yourself won't know for sure that they're wrong. But it will at least be more fun to work on what you want.
