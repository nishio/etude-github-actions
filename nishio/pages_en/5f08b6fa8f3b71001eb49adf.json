Dinic
 Algorithm for finding [maximum flow
　　Dinic is O(V^2E)
	[History of Algorithms for Finding Maximum Flow]
	[AOJ GRL_6_A Maximum Flow http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=GRL_6_A&lang=jp] to verify implementation.
 My Python implementation (verified by AOJ)
 　The edge is waiting in defaultdict(dict), so there is no need to have the index of the inverse side to get the inverse side.
 　　(Many C++ implementations have an inverse index on each side.)
 　Do not search for previously explored edges.
 　　This is achieved by having "the first index of the edge not yet explored" in the `itertion_count`.
 　　To use this, we need a mapping from index to edges, so we make it first in `max_flow`: `edges_index`.
