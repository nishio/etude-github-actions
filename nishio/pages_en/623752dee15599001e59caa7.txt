Mechanical Additions in Scrapbox
background
 In [/dominion], sometimes I write about a card by looking at the English text and sometimes by looking at the Japanese text, and I want both links to be connected.
　After making a few by hand, I settled on "put the Japanese card name in the title" and "put a link to the English name in the body text".
　If this is not done for the remaining hundreds, the benefit of "connecting in both Japanese and English" will not be achieved.
　　I don't want to do it manually, so I'll generate it mechanically.
　I don't want to overwrite something hand-crafted with something machine-generated.
　　It has not been determined whether or not to add to what is already there, so I will add it anyway.

mounting
　First, export the current project with updated date and time
　See the Eiwa list.
　　If you already have a page, add it.
　　If not, create and add an older date.
