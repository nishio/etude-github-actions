Reset VRAM on Google Colab
I was doing a process in Google Colab that used a lot of video memory, and the first time it worked, but the second time I got an error because I didn't have enough memory.
This is due to the fact that "instances that are not needed are still alive grabbing video memory.
　The first run, Y was not yet created when doing X. The second run, X is done with the remaining Y created in the first run.
　Colab's environment keeps grabbing global variables created in the past, which is why they are not GC'd.

So we explicitly release it.
code:py
 from numba import cuda
 device = cuda.get_current_device() 
 device.reset()

Not tested if this is correct.
