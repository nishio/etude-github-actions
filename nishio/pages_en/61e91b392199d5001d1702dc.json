(4.4.1) How to read philosophical books
I introduce the book "[Technique to Read Difficult Books]" by Literature Professor [Akinori Takada].

Takada explains how to read difficult books such as philosophy books. He recommends twice while making reading notes. The reading method takes 20 hours for one book. If the book has 300 pages, it is four minutes per page. This speed is slower than [reading aloud]. However, as you read twice and take notes, the speed of your eyes must be faster than the reading aloud.

In this technique, we spend much time to figure out what book the book is.
