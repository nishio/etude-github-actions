　　This idea implicitly assumes that humans are more precious than other
　　It is not obvious that if some people commit acts that undermine civilization, we should respect them or not.
　　For example, "killing an idea" is more casually and frequently done today than "killing a human being."
　　　Of course, people today recognize that "killing humans" is a bad idea.
　　　When people were being casually killed, they didn't think killing humans was as bad as it is now.
　　　What we are casually doing now to "kill an idea" may be an act of barbarism that is out of the ordinary in the eyes of future generations.
　　　It is not obvious whether the act of an idea being killed by "ethics", which is only a value at the present time, is different from the act of a human being being killed by the idea that a certain race is superior at a certain point in time.
