About [Anti-aliasing
 Recommended by [vrdaveb
  In [Player Settings], set [Rendering Path] to Forward.
  	Maybe [Graphic Settings]?
   Already Forward by default
  Multi Sampling ([MSAA]) in Anti Aliasing under Quality Settings
 MSAA is lighter than Image Effects anti-aliasing ([FXAA])
 Polygon edges are much cleaner.
 2x MSAA is almost no cost for Gear VR
 I made it to [nishio.icon]8x and it didn't seem pretty.
 	I set [MSAA] to disable because I did [FXAA], but since you said no cost up to 2x, I set it to 2x.
