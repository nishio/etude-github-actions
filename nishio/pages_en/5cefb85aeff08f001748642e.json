Why does pi appear in the sum of the reciprocals of square numbers?
[$ \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \ldots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}]の理由

Why [pi] appears in the sum of the reciprocals of square numbers

	Let c be the hypotenuse.
	The area of a triangle can be expressed in two ways
	[$ a b /2= c h/2]
	[$ a^2 b^2 = c^2 h^2]
	[$ a^2 b^2 = (a^2 + b^2) h^2]
	[$ 1 / h^2 = (a^2 + b^2) / a^2 b^2 = a^2 / a^2 b^2 + b^2 / a^2 b^2  = 1 / a^2 + 1 /  b^2]

	When the diameter is d, the circumference is pi d
	Since the circumference is 2, the diameter is 2/pi
	Inverse square, so pi^2 / 4

	2x diameter, 2x circumference, arc length for 1/2 central angle, so same length

	Explanation of the central angle being 1/2

	I found that the sum of the odd square numbers is pi^2/8.
	If the sum of the square numbers is S, then the sum of even square numbers is 1/4 S
	The sum of the squares of the cardinal numbers is S - 1/4 S= 3/4 S
	なので[$ S = \frac{\pi^2}{8} \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} ]
