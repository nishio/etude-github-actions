 Singapore is $1.00 for less than 70 yen. 3 of us took a cab from the airport to the hotel and it took about 15 minutes at about 100 km/h. The late-night fare was $24.00. That is 560 yen per person.
 
 There were many 7-Eleven stores in Singapore.

 Dinner!

 That's less than $10. 700 yen.

 You're a long-grained variety!
 
 It was quite spicy and tasty.

 Sadly, I seem to have left my bag of toiletries and my bag of cables at home. I only have the machine, AC adapter, iPhone, iPhone-USB cable, and a change of clothes. I'm so disappointed.

 It's like SimCity where long and narrow buildings are densely packed together. Building coverage ratio? Floor-area ratio? Are there any regulations on building-to-land ratio or floor-area ratio?

 For some reason, when I searched by floor area ratio, I got Chinese search results.

 Went out for lunch, but forgot my iPhone so no pictures. Noodle + chicken dish for $3.8, or about 250 yen. Last night's dinner was at a convenience store, so it was expensive, but at the mall's food court it was about that much. At a restaurant outside the mall, it says "two meat and one vegetable $2.8", so I guess that means it costs about 200 yen.
 
 Stationery stores are horribly full of Japanese products. Kokuyo is everywhere. Convenience store drinks are full of Pokka. The 7-Eleven convenience store is full of them. And in the afternoon, they take a double-decker bus to Uniqlo to buy sandals and short pants.
 
 <hr>
 
 I heard that green tea is powdery like matcha, so I bought Pokka Oolong tea at the supermarket. 1.5 liters for $2.10. There is no 100 yen packaged tea like in Japanese convenience stores, but the unit price is not so different.
 
 It's super hot, so drinks are a must!

 I bought a Suica-like card, paid $15 and it says $5 is non-refundable card cost and $10 (700 yen) is initial add value. 700 yen seems like it would run out quickly with Suica, but I took 3 buses and 1 train and went to Merlion and Chinatown. I took a bus three times and a train once to visit Merlion and Chinatown, but I didn't spend $3. Transportation costs are cheap.
 
 Escalators are fast.

 Merlion. This is indeed a dreary one. It's one of the three biggest disappointments in the world.
 Choron.

 Rather, what's with the hanging gardens? A ship! Is it possible to do this kind of thing because earthquakes don't happen?
 
 f:id:nishiohirokazu:20100429154607j:image
 Well, here is the new one.
 
 <hr>
 
 Take a bus to Chinatown.

 As a Kansai person, I am afraid that this highway is going to fall down.

 What is this?

 The black one is Rojak for $3. Rojak was a mystery food. It is a mixture of cucumber, pineapple, apple, and some kind of sweet miso paste, with some kind of walnut powder on top. <a href='http://www.streetdirectory.com/restaurants/local_food/local-414-rojak.php'>Rojak - Singapore Foods</a>

 Chicken rice. The fried one was hard to eat because of the bones in it. I heard that steamed chicken rice is better. It was also $3.
 
 In the end, Rajek was left to distribute to everyone because the quantity was too large and he could not get used to the taste. That's $8, so about 550 yen. That's cheap!

 Old vs. new.
 
 *1272556341*Singapore Observations
 - Area of Singapore: 707 km2, Tokyo wards: 622 km2
 - Singapore population: 5M, Tokyo wards: 9M
 - Buses come fairly often.
 - Surprisingly, there are cigarette butts. Some people walk around smoking.
 - There is an erotic goods store along the main street.
 - You can buy a Cisco router or an iPad at a shopping mall. It's like a big Akihabara.
 - There are plenty of trash cans.
 - There are plenty of smoking areas here and there, so it seems like a good place for smokers to spend some time.
 - It is chaotic and interesting to see four different languages mixed together. I can't read Tamil, so I wanted to learn it.
 - The management class is very smart. I feel that the country is being managed quite well. I thought that Japan should imitate them. I wonder if Japan as a whole is too big to use the same method.
