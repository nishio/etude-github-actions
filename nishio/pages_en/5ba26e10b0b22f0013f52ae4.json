Fundamental attribution error
With regard to other people's behavior, we think, "He did it because he was the type of person who does that kind of thing," and with regard to our own behavior, we think, "I was in a situation where I had to do that kind of thing" [human bug].

>Fundamental attribution error refers to the tendency to place too much emphasis on dispositional or personality aspects and too little on situational aspects in explaining individual behavior. [Also [Fundamental attribution error], [Basic attribution error], [Fundamental attribution error], [Correspondence bias].
>Humans tend to see a person's behavior as being determined by his or her "kind" without evidence and tend to downplay social and situational influences. They also tend to view their own behavior in the opposite way. This inconsistency is called the "actor-observer bias.
