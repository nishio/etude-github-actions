People at the highest point
vi 

We are not born perfect. Every day we grow in our character and in our profession until we reach the highest point of perfection of our being, that is, to the point where we fully demonstrate our accomplishments and excellence. This is purity of taste, clarity of thought, maturity of judgment, firmness of will. Some never reach perfection, some are always immature, some ripen late. The perfect man is wise in speech, prudent in action, and able to enter into the intimacy of the prudent and even be sought after by them.
