latent semantic factoring
	Latent Semantic Analysis: [Latent Semantic Analysis], [LSA]
	Latent Semantic Indexing or Latent Semantic Index: [Latent Semantic Indexing], [LSI].

	Sparse matrix with each row for each word and each column for each document
 	Use [tf-idf] to weight each component
  Singular value decomposition] of this matrix
		If we choose k largest singular values, we can [embed] with the smallest error into k dimensions
  	[Frobenius norm].
  Equivalent to learning a function for obtaining a word tf-idf vector from a document ID in an [Autoencoder]-like network with k hidden layers and 1 layer
