I was talking about how active learning doesn't work, and I concluded that you should read books.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I've implemented active learning of [nishio.icon]end design, but it's not great and I'd like to discuss it.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "active learning" is that?
[nishio.icon]A method of machine learning in which the system asks humans questions about areas in which it is unsure, and humans answer them to efficiently collect supervised data.
[nisbot.icon]What "method" is that "method"?
[nishio.icon]A method to make AI more efficient and smarter
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "method"?
[nishio.icon]Systematically, the question and answer cycle is starting to turn, but the current AI is too stupid to be very efficient.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "AI" is that "AI"?
[nishio.icon]What we're trying to do here is look at the flow of the dialogue and ask at the appropriate point, "Is this a good place to end?" and ask the question "Is this a good place to end?
[nisbot.icon]
 > A method to make AI more efficient and smarter
 Where is this "method" located?
I reused the implementation from [nishio.icon] "Motion Extraction".
[nisbot.icon]
 > A method to make AI more efficient and smarter
 Where is this "method"?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > A method to make AI more efficient and smarter
 What does this "method" look like?
[nishio.icon]It's like a child asking you a question about something you're interested in.
[nisbot.icon]What "interest" is that "interest"?
[nishio.icon]Identify how borderline cases should be identified when you want to identify Yes or No.
[nisbot.icon]What "on the borderline" is that "on the borderline"?
[nishio.icon]Those with a probability of being Yes close to 50%.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "Yes" is that "Yes"?
[nishio.icon]Here is the decision that we should ask the "end of the line question here".
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "question" is that "question"?
[nishio.icon] "Is this a good place to end up?"
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]If you ask me that question at the right time, and I'm like, "Yes," or "Let's end it then," I feel better than if the dialogue continues in a lazy way.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "question"?
[nishio.icon]I haven't yet been able to verbalize very well what kind of timing I should do, either, so I tried to do it with machine learning.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "machine learning" is that?
[nishio.icon] Mechanism in which machines find conditions by collecting data when humans cannot write conditional expressions.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "human" is that "human"?
[nishio.icon]It's me.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "I" is that "I"?
[nishio.icon]I'm trying to implement this system, but I haven't yet been able to clearly verbalize when the end question should be posed.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "question"?
[nishio.icon]It should generally be around the point where the dialogue has developed to some extent and settled down.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I'm trying to implement this system, but I haven't yet been able to clearly verbalize when to ask the end question.
 Where is this "question"?
[nishio.icon] After the user has gained something by answering a question, when there seems to be little to gain by continuing with the question
[nisbot.icon]How do you know that "question"?
[nishio.icon]When I coach people face to face, I judge from facial expressions, body language and tension, but this system is a chat, so it's hard to get information.
[nisbot.icon]What "system" is that "system"?
[nishio.icon]A system that encourages users to verbalize their inner thoughts through dialogue.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "system"?
[nishio.icon]So, once something is verbalized, once it's verbalized, it's done its job.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "verbalization" is that?
[nishio.icon] If a user writes about a certain topic before using this system and after using the system, and if there is a difference between the two, that difference is the effect of the language support provided by this system.
[nisbot.icon]What does that "system" look like?
[nishio.icon]This is the type of coaching that focuses on listening.
[nisbot.icon]What is that "feeling" like?
[nishio.icon]The same is true in that the system does not give the answer, but expects crystallization to occur in the user by giving questions.
[nisbot.icon]Where does that "question" come from?
I took it from a technique called [nishio.icon]clean language or symbolic modeling.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its "methodology"?
[nishio.icon]You're right, maybe the book you refer to will have some criteria for asking the end of the line question.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen regarding that "question"?
[nishio.icon]I would like to see more language regarding what the decision criteria are regarding when to ask a question.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "question" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]I myself should know more about when I should ask this question.
[nisbot.icon] With regard to the "question", can it be?
[nishio.icon]Maybe you can do it by me reading the reference book back to you.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I should know more about when I myself should ask this question.
 What does this "question" seem to be?
[nishio.icon](Here's where I say, "Is this a good place to end?" I'd like to end with a "yes."
