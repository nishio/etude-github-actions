The concept of natural language is circularly defined.
	Human natural language does not neatly define all the meanings of words.
 	Most of us humans can't even answer the question, "What is goodness?"
  We think we have "defined" the state of [circular references] to each other as [opposing concepts], and we build up concepts on top of each other.
  In [the developmental process], [pleasure and displeasure] are probably born primitively first.
