Sociocultural Evolution
>Human beings are the product of both socio-cultural evolution and [biological evolution] [dual inheritance theory].
> Each factor has a separate [selection mechanism] and mode of transmission (biologically [genes]; units of [cultural evolution] are often called [memes])

Changes in [corporate culture] could be described in the same way, through meme transmission and selection mechanisms.
　Cases where the company's [vision] is put on the website, but it does not become [culture].
　　Is the vision replicated in the individual employee in the first place?
　　For example, in the case of Cybozu, one of the memes is "fairness and impartiality," and when there is a discussion about whether to choose Plan A or Plan B, the conclusion may be "Plan A is more expensive, but it is fair, so let's choose Plan A. At this time, the "fairness" meme is replicated by the participants in the discussion.
　　　The two memes, "We should select Plan A, which is costly but fair," and "We should select Plan B, which is less fair but less costly," are selected through the "selection pressure" and "selection mechanism" of debate.
　　　The "meme that disrespects fairness" is getting weeded out.
　　　This is the process of establishing a corporate culture
　　[Ondrej creates a common language].
　　　This too can be explained by memes.
　　　Memes are replicated by posting them on owned media.
　　　Also, by releasing a meme outside the company and having it praised, it becomes [social proof] that "this meme is not a [Galapagos concept] that survives only within the company, but something that can be accepted by outside society as well.
