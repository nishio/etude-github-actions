Opinions on Kindleization
We are gathering information that we have witnessed because the publishers do not seem to understand the needs of the Kindle version.
As for my book, "The Intellectual Production of Engineers," it will be available on Kindle by the end of November.

People who don't buy books sold now because they want the Kindle version.

 	>I'm still having trouble buying it as a pdf and sending it to my kindle. One reason is that I can't do that transfer process, comfortably, with just my phone.
 	>I've done it three times in the past month when I see a link to amazon on twitter or hateboob, go to amazon, and if they don't have a kindle version, I just decide to forget about it.
 	>All of them are Nishio's books.

 	>When I want to introduce a book at a client's place, there are so many cases where I buy a kindle on the spot.

		>I bought an e-book of "The Intellectual Productivity of Engineers" and wanted to read it on my Kindle, but the file size was too big to attach to an email and I couldn't do Send-to-Kindle. I ended up transferring it as a PDF file, and I'm wondering why.

		>I thought my personal document that I sent to kindle on my Fire HD 10 was not reflected on my kindle at all, but it was inside the "send-to-kindle document" in "documents"... inside the "book (i.e. kindle app)". Can't you please do this for me? Only the intellectual production techniques of engineers are isolated.
