 Initial Considerations
  You can only move from higher elevations to lower elevations.
  　directed graph
  Lots of goals.
  　Bundling around cost 0?
  　　[united in goal].
  　One to all [Dijkstra method] from each goal?
  　Let's do the latter, and if not, let's do the former.
　　Consideration complete
　mounting
　　If we were to do the Dijkstra method anyway, the additional man-hours to implement the former would not be significant, so we decided there was no advantage to doing the latter.
　　Additional code to implement the former : `(1)`.
