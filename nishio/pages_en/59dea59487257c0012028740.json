>I heard a case of information sharing going wrong with slack.
>/ writing demands accountability.
>If you don't write it down properly, people will think you're cutting corners.
>When you write something messy, the risk is huge when the material gets out on its own.
>I feel like I'm trying to use flow media the same way I use stock media, and I'm having an accident.

 #Flow and Stock
  Slack is a chat, not a UI suited to organizing information
  It's not a place to spend the cost of writing in the first place, because it will drift away soon after you've put the effort into it.
 #Guerrilla warfare between superiors and bottoms up
 	Slack would have made it easier for each member of the organization to disseminate information
  Picking it up well would have made bottom-up possible.
  The cost of information dissemination has jumped due to the atmosphere created by accountability and other factors that make it difficult to write in a cursory manner.
  Slack's advantages are gone.
 Atmosphere that does not allow for messy writing
 	How did this atmosphere come about?
  Excessive quality requirements for written materials for internal communication.
  Similar to the process by which a product comes to have excessive quality #Excessive Quality

 There are those who interpret that being a chat means "write fast and short" and being a wiki means "anyone can rewrite", and there are those who don't interpret it that way, and when the latter are in a position to decide how to use the tool, they decide to do it the way they are used to.
  For example, this case study, "Don't do real-world synchronous communication in asynchronous chat," argues

   On the other hand, time is wasted in this exchange because the hand is stopped at the first notification. It assumes the speaker's accustomed method of "first comes the requirements."
