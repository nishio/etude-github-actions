What is a connection?
2015-09-09
What I wrote while listening to the lectures of other speakers at an omnibus lecture at [Tokyo Metropolitan University].
The speaker said, "[Connections matter]."

	>When I was a student, I hated old men who said "connections are important. Now that I am an old man, I understand what they were trying to convey. I now think that there was a discrepancy between my interpretation of the word "[connections]" and their interpretation of the word "connections.
	>I used to think of connections as something determined by luck, like having great parents, but there is no way that an old man giving advice to students would say that such "things that cannot be done by one's own efforts" are important. Of course they are talking about "connections that can be made through effort. How are these made?
 >The way to make it is this: "Befriend people. Befriending them in the past will help you, but messing with them in the past will make them bounce back." You can't make connections that will help you later by laughing and exchanging business cards. It is made by [helping others first].
 	>[https://twitter.com/mamoruk/status/641480571776991232 mamoruk] What I think is important: 1. be faster (= more capable) than others. When merging on the highway, don't slow down. Continuously improve your ability.2. Be friendly with people. Befriending the past will help you, but bullying the past will bounce back.3. Health first. Mental health too.
 >So I think what Osan meant by "connections are important" was, to put it in a way that was easy for me to understand at the time, "Help those around you so that more people will help you when you are in trouble, and that is important. No one ever taught me that much, though.
