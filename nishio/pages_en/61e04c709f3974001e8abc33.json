What I found while researching

　I did it in the bath.
　In the picture, you're sitting along the long feature of the tub, but then one of your hands is in contact with the wall next to the tub.
　　Distorted posture from side to side when trying to avoid it.
　　You should sit at right angles to the long section of the tub.
　I've always thought, "When I rotate my shoulder, I don't hear a bang," but the resolution of that "rotate" has increased.
　　Both shoulders buckle when the scapular is lowered.
　　Right shoulder also says pack rotation.
　I was bummed out by the end of the 10×3, but it seemed to be decreasing.
　　Shoulder may improve if done often in the future.
