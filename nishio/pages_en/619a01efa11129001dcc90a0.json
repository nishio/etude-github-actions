Blind tote bag?
After making [tote bag], I was thinking that the density of information is uneven, so next time I'll cut it into a grid and arrange the images like cards... and I thought, isn't that [blind spot card]? I thought.

[a book as a collection of letters] not a form of "collection of useful knowledge."
　The blind spot card was initially envisioned as "a card with a picture and its explanatory booklet.
　　And it all started with [tarot cards] in the first place.
　But we've resorted to having letters.
　Trying to make a tote bag, I was more constrained to use only pictures to express myself.
　　Some of the pictures that were there before were modified to be more communicative with just pictures.
　I was under the impression that the card would have a name attached to it.
　　That's what tarot cards are for.
　If I'm going to use a tote bag, I want it to be about a number.
　　Why? Why not just have the title written on each picture?
　　　I'm just interested in "non-literal expression" rather than because this is a tote bag.
