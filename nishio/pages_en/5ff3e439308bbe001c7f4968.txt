Project note on [Tools to organize your head]([Regroup])

We needed to create [a network of demand requests].
ã€€That should have been a higher priority than managing task status in Scrapbox.


[Regroup Release Note 2021/5/11].

ã€€Cover Undo with a test
ã€€ã€€Currently, it probably doesn't work at all.
ã€€Use it to organize your Twitter replies.
 ã€€Replies (unlike my usual writing) are in a "japanese" style, which eats up the number of characters.
 IME on for import and forget to turn it off and the cursor gets stuck?
 ã€€Can't it be turned off when the dialog is closed?
ã€€Clear content when import is closed

ã€€[I would like to discuss the design of Regroup.]
ã€€ã€€[Stop ðŸ¤”parallel shift mode].
	[It would be nice to have more language about what happens after exporting from Keicho to Regroup].
	ã€€Need to get a message from the guide during the tutorial.
 ã€€Tutorials should limit what you can do.

	[ðŸ¤”Make 3 explanations of how to use Regroup in specific applications].
	[ðŸ¤”I want to know how many stickies are there now.]
ã€€[ðŸ¤”Import screen, should there be a button to make it easier to edit on iPad?]
	[ðŸ¤”Generate Regroup map from multi-line text].

ã€€Would be nice to have the ability to [ðŸ¤” make a screenshot in full size
ã€€[Icons of external link stickies are shifted when stickies are enlarged.]
ã€€Selection highlight is thin and difficult to see when zoomed out and selected
ã€€I created a function for titled stickies, but [server side rendering] is required to "show the title when pasting an external site", which was my initial expectation.
 ã€€If you are going to make a SSR, it would be better to make a thumbnail at the "Create a link for sharing" stage.
 ã€€3/29/2021 Once commented out of the menu
ã€€The ability to zoom out to the overall view would be nice.
ã€€ã€€That's what you're doing when you don't specify a viewport in the URL, so if you can activate that, that's good.
 Is it easier to find and move newly added stickies (one or more) if I keep them selected?
ã€€Paste maintains the original coordinates, so it may appear off-screen.
ã€€ã€€Should I zoom out as far as I can see?
ã€€In lasso mode, sometimes the selected highlight does not appear even though it is enclosed. If I try to move it in that state, of course it doesn't work. Unlocking the lasso doesn't work either.
ã€€ã€€It is not yet clear if this happens outside of finger manipulation on the iPad.
ã€€No ghosting indicator when lassoing, making it difficult to move multiple pieces and place them in a good spot on an existing sticky.
ã€€ã€€However, ghosting displays would make multiple moves less smooth.
ã€€ã€€For example, only the border line can be produced, or only when the number of sheets is small, etc...
ã€€Have you heard of Undo for lasso selection movement?

	[REGROUP-10] 
ã€€When selecting stickies in lasso mode on iPad and x2, gray selection highlighting winds up occurring for empty groups.
		Not reproduced.
ã€€[Export in JSON format] Low priority
ã€€ã€€Select and copy will go into the clipboard.
ã€€ã€€Want to export as a file?
ã€€ã€€In that case, you'd want to import it as a file.

	[OpenURL can also be used for image links.]
