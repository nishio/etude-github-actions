Careful mechanism for choosing keywords and questions
	I think the choice of keywords and questions is [an attention mechanism].
		Some time after I wrote this, I came to the conclusion that [the choice of keywords and questions is an inner product caution].
	As for the lone keyword/question pair, that's exactly what it is.
		Now we're multiplying the "keyword score" by the "score for the degree to which the keyword is likely to apply to the question.
	Questions that do not take a keyword or two keywords exist.
		The mediation there is a mystery.
		If you have promising keywords, you want to drill down on those keywords
		If multiple high scoring keywords come up, I'd like to hear the relationship between those keywords.
		It would be nice to have a recap of the initial objective so we don't go off topic.
			= Attention to conversation in the early stages is maintained.

	What is "promising" and "high scoring?"
