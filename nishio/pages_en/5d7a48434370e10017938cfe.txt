Phenomenon that the chassis version is not seen.
When using impressions as the denominator and displaying the percentage of people who viewed it, "RoboMasterS1 Assembly Video #4 Chassis" was unexpectedly 0.0% of the total impressions.

Cause Consideration
	I don't know what a "chassis" is.
	The "chassis version" doesn't sound very interesting.
	No one watches from episode 4.
	I thought it would be better to know from the title that it was a continuation, but it seems to have had the opposite effect?
