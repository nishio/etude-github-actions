(5.2.7) Spread bundles again
We made bundles so far. We compressed information. From here we reverse the direction. We expand the bundles to make illustration and documentation. 

First, we place the bundles on a large pager. At this time we need to find the most comfortable composition by trial and error.

Second, we expand a bundle to take out the pieces below one level. And then we place those pieces in a calm composition, taking into consideration the relationship with the pieces around it. Repeat this until expanding all the bundles.

Third, the next phase is an "[illustration(A)]." Look at the spatially arranged pieces, enclose the grouped pieces with a circle, or add an arrow between the circles and the circles.

Fig: Add arrows which represent a conflict or a flow of talk

These circles and arrows represent the relationship. For examples:

	Opinions A and B are conflicting.
	I talk A first and then I talk B.

In the phase of group organization, we expressed various relationships by placing pieces near. We do not have to clarify the types of relationships. However, if you can verbalize the relationship, write it down in this phase.

At first, you had many pieces of information. You could not organize them. By this step of the KJ method, you get an "illustration." In this illustration, the related pieces are placed close. Circles and arrows added to express the relationship between the pieces. It is like a [map].
