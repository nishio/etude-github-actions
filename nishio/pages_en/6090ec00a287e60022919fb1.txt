 **1245104751* BÃ©zier Curved Bounding Box
 <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve'>B&#233;zier curve - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>
 
 B(t) = (1-t)^3 * P0 + 3 * (1-t)^2 * t * P1 + 3 * (1-t) * t^2 * P2 + t^3 * P3
 therefore
 B'(t) = -3 * P0 * (1 - t)^2 + 3 * P1 * (1 - t)^2 - 6 * P1 * (1 - t) * t + 6 * P2 * (1 - t) * t - 3 * P2 * t^2 + 3 * P3 * t^2
 When t falls within 0~1 of the solution t = ((-6 P0+12 P1-6 P2)+-sqrt((6 P0-12 P1+6 P2)^2-4 (3 P1-3 P0) (-3 P0+9 P1-9 P2+3 P3)))/(2 (-3 P0+9 P1-9 P2+3 P3))(-3 P0+9 P1-9 P2+3 P3!=0) I should just calculate the value of B(t) in B(t) and find the minimum and maximum values along with B(0) = P0 and B(1) = P3. Maybe. I'll implement it later.

  It seems to be.
 
 (I removed the code that was here because it was not there at all.)

 This time it seems to be there.

 Hee-hee.

 Since it is distributed over a 5-dimensional space, it changes in various ways when the cutting plane is changed.

 I've been running it for a while and haven't found any glaring problems, so I'm releasing it to the public.

 I wonder if the only way to make it look additive is to keep it in a very low alpha state, since it will only mix with the alpha and not be additive composition.
 
 
 When I looked at it again after I left for a while... it's still too much to say that this is light, isn't it? The texture. It looks like milk was spilled on a black paper, or water was dropped on it and the color was lost.

 <body>I trackbacked you, the equation can be more optimized. <br>Sorry if you knew this long ago, but it's easier if you use wxMaxima. </body>

 <body>Thanks for pointing out the code here, there are a lot of unexpected pitfalls. <br>Also, in this example, "calc_box([12,0], [[4,0, 6,0, 18,0]])" would return slightly wrong values. <br>"t = -c / b" => "t = float(-c) / float(b)" <br>I mean, this is a pitfall of python...(Actually, I got stuck too)<br>It's ok if you have python3 or later :-)</body>.

 <body>I see what you mean, I didn't notice it in the test code because it was a float before entering this function. </body>
