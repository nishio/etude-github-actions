Bernie controversy

	[Resource-based view - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-based_view]
	 Proposition 1: When a firm's management resources (resources) are valuable and scarce, the firm gains a competitive advantage.
 	Proposition 2: A firm gains a sustainable competitive advantage when its resources are not imitable or substitutable by others.

Richard Prim, John Butler (2001)
	Pointed out that the meaning of the term "[competitive advantage]" in Proposition 1 is unclear.
 If "competitive advantage" is defined as "higher value than other companies" or "scarcity
		When a company's resources are valuable and scarce, it acquires 'something valuable and scarce.'"
		Pointing out that this is a tautology.

Jay Barney (2001)
	Argues that it is not important whether the words can be replaced to be [tautological].
	Claims that if empirical research can be done, it doesn't matter, and empirical research has been done.

Richard Prim, John Butler (2001)
	Argues that problems arising in the world of theory should be solved in the world of theory
 Argues that the idea that there is no problem if empirical research can be done is false.
 	In the world of [nishio.icon] theory, when the theory "if X, then X'" is established, it is natural that when the correlation is shown by taking real data A corresponding to X and real data B corresponding to X', the correlation should appear because the original theory is almost a tautology.
