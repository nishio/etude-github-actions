Should there be common screening criteria?
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1388196132937895936]: "The review criteria differ from mentor to mentor" might make some people think "Why, it should be unified". In reality, it is "values differ from mentor to mentor (of course)" and "mentors will adopt the project they most want to adopt (of course)".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1388196508982407168]: So the question is "Should there be common criteria for reviewing projects independent of mentors?" and the answer is "No, because that would undermine the diversity of adopted projects. I think the answer is "yes".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1388213979411980288]: I understand one more step, but isn't the adoption algorithm other than "the mentor will adopt the one they most want to adopt" irrational because the mentor has to drop someone else they want to adopt and I think it's irrational because the mentor may want to adopt someone else, and then have to drop that person and adopt someone he/she doesn't want to adopt.
