[after the fact][edit].
	'Instead of preparing a sticky note and then drawing a picture, you draw a picture and then make it a sticky note.'
	It's not good to be able to make something look the way you want it to without proper preparation beforehand; you want to draw it first and then make it a sticky note after the fact."

Similarly, it is not enough to be able to draw a red line after switching to a red pen; we should be able to make a drawn line red after the fact.

It is easier to have the implementation write all the parameters in advance, which is an act of the programmer cutting corners and imposing costs on the user.
