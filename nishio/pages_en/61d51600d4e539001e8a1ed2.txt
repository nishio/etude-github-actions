Pulling and combining from the outside world what is not in the company
>[Cybozu]'s previous experience has had the effect of growing branches all at once by people who are doing multiple jobs. The economist Schumpeter defines innovation as "[new combinations]. Double business is precisely what creates that new union, isn't it? [Innovation is the ability to pull something from the outside world that does not exist within the company and combine it. Given this, I only wish that everyone would do double jobs in worlds I don't know about and accelerate innovation ([Aono http://mydeskteam.com/casefile/1887/]).
