Useful" and "interesting."

	We talked about "useful" and "interesting."
	Interesting" is [subjective].
	Useful" entails objective evidence.
	No evidence of "usefulness" has yet been verbalized or discovered.
	Feelings of "no evidence, but it might be useful in the future."
		This is one kind of "interesting," but not all.
	Some types of people are not at all interested in whether or not they're useful.
	Desire to know the [unknown
		It's "interesting" to know
	When interviewing scientists, instead of asking, "What's useful?" I mentioned that when interviewing scientists, it is better to ask "What's interesting? would elicit more lively answers than "What's useful?
		"What's in it for you?" is interpreted as "Explain the [objective reason] for doing it," and the constructed reason is answered.
		Actual behavior is generated by subjective motivation.
		The question, "What is it that you do for fun?" The question "What's interesting to you?" is asking about subjective reasons for behavior.
