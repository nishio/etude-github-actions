Dangling is not grouping.
>[Foam_Crab https://twitter.com/Foam_Crab/status/1431093128883105799]: I have found that it is sort of obvious that the sticky note type is better for arranging words.
>[Foam_Crab https://twitter.com/Foam_Crab/status/1431094941028028418]: Sometimes I want to group the Scrapbox pages themselves to think about my own tendencies (*I want Scrapbox to I sometimes want to group Scrapbox pages to think about my own trends (not that I want this feature in Scrapbox), but it doesn't work well when I handle it in "rows" (which consumes extra cognitive resources). In such cases, Kozaneba may work well.
>[Foam_Crab https://twitter.com/Foam_Crab/status/1431095394973282312]: [/noratetsu/●Snapshot001 (2021-05-19 version)] This is the trial I did on the "line", but it was something like this, I couldn't imagine an organic group feeling, so it didn't work as well as I thought it would. When I tried it, I thought it worked.
>[Foam_Crab https://twitter.com/Foam_Crab/status/1431097031334895620]: my brain is grouping and grouping together to create appropriate parent-child sibling relationships and hang them in a tree-like (or root-like) fashion It may be that it does not perceive this as a Like it's logically put together but my body (Shinto) doesn't feel a sense of cohesion in it.
	[* I don't recognize that creating parent-child sibling relationships and hanging them in a tree-like fashion is grouping them together into a cohesive group].
>[Foam_Crab https://twitter.com/Foam_Crab/status/1431100595067240451]: "Position" and "layout" are still important. No matter how good plain text is for handling data, I am not a computer, and I should not try to follow the way that is convenient for computers. You have to "think" and "feel" with your own mind before handling data...

(I mean, how can we distinguish this as a logical structure? For example, there could be [* multiple kinds of parent-child relationships] or something like that.)
	>[pokarim https://twitter.com/pokarim/status/1431105195556032512]: I feel the difference between HTML attributes and child nodes is a bit like this. Attributes are contained in the inner part of the figure on the right. The child node is the one that is linked to the outside, as shown in the left image.
>[pokarim https://twitter.com/pokarim/status/1431108270140264448]:"[* I might be saying that we don't recognize that creating a parent-child sibling relationship and hanging it in a tree shape as grouping it together into a cohesive whole." which makes me wonder if you perceive the tree as a left image rather than a right one. I am like that too.

	Meaning "can be created later." It doesn't mean "can be created later" (although of course it can).

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1431120828754632707]: "what is the parent" becomes fixed when it is made into a group. Seems to me I'm subconsciously trying to "delay the fixation as long as possible".
