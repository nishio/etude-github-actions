 I write because I get trackbacks and I just want to write. Continuation of the generator story. (http://d.hatena.ne.jp/jbking/20071007/p1)
 After all, you are just asserting two unrelated points: "Python generators make it easy to write iterators" and "Java's java.util.concurrent.Exchanger makes it easy to write asynchronous processing".
 It is amusing to see him try to make the argument that "it's a matter of taste" and "the key is to know how to use it," and then launch into an attack that is not an attack at all, saying that "Python generators are for making iterators easily," which is as if he were saying "you cannot write asynchronous processing as easily as Java with a Python generator. It is interesting to see how he launches attacks that are not really attacks at all.
 I wonder why people behave this way and why I can't go through the motions and mention comments on other people's blogs. Can someone please tell me?

 To change my inertia, I first went to a restaurant I had never been to before. I came to a seedy ramen shop. Surprisingly, the place was thriving. I hope it is delicious.
 
 
 *1191758719* Difference between original brain makers and fakes.
 
 original

 imitation

 Something is coming out of your nose!
 
 Also, the fake one does not remove spaces before and after the input string, so you can try various things without changing the appearance of the name by adding as many spaces at the beginning as you like.
 
 *1191758720* Brain exercise
 
 An exercise in writing down what services have in common using only common words. Each X and Y do not necessarily match. Since it is difficult to tell which is X from the common points alone, write down the points that are slightly different.
 
 The similarity between X and Y is that both have the ability to inform others that they have been mentioned using a special shorthand notation. The difference is that X notifies through a push-type method called e-mail, whereas Y requires the user to actively view a list page of mentions.
 
 The common feature of X and Y is that each user's statements are displayed in chronological order on a single timeline. Both have a function to notify a specific user when a certain string of characters appears. The difference is that in the former, the "specific string" is fixed, while in the latter, the user can arbitrarily set any number of strings.
 
 The similarities between X and Y are that users register other users in advance, the other party is notified that they have registered, and the registered users' posts are displayed in a chronological list. The difference is that the former allows only short strings of text with a limited number of characters to be posted, while the latter allows images and videos to be posted.

 <body>> You wanted to make sure that you are just arguing two irrelevant points<br>. That's why it wasn't an attack in the first place. The JavaDoc sample code was very clear about asynchronous processing, but there was no iterator sample, so I wasn't sure if the Python equivalent of a generator would also be very clear. </body>.

 <body>The point may be obvious from the opposite point of view to those who know both, but those who know only one of them can only think that it is probably true from the opposite point of view. </body>
