Cookie Clicker Rustic Strategies
Strategies that people who don't think much tend to choose naively.

　B: Buy the smallest minimum investment price
　　Will be the same as A, savings go up, buy when the minimum price is exceeded.

　C: Buy all in the same quantity
　　Buy the least

　D: Increase the smallest percentage of the total return
