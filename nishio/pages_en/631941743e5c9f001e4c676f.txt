Management and Accountability
>[https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1567681816374693889?s=21&t=zBcjdG2WILWOPNvDPpTDtw @hrjn]: when it comes to management, everyone wants to manage, but the higher the management, the more accountability I personally think it's better to focus on accountability.
>The reason is that the more we deal with global matters, the lower the resolution of the story.
>If it's five people or something, you can look at specific events, but if it's a hundred people, you can't look at specifics. Can you explain this?

	[Global]
	[Cognitive Resolution]
	[I can't see a hundred specifics.]

[Management] and [accountability].
