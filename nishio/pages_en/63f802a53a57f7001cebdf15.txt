 >Even when a HACCP-type system is implemented, the following substantial concerns were identified in the risk profile
 > (1) Aerobic bacteria counts are high in total.
 > (2) Survival of spore-forming bacteria is confirmed even after heat treatment.
 > (3) There is a problem of allergenicity of insects and insect-derived products.
 > (4) There is a problem of bioaccumulation of heavy metals (cadmium, etc.).
 > Other risks such as parasites, fungi, viruses, prions, antimicrobial resistance and toxins were determined to be low. It should be emphasized that further evidence is needed for several risks.
