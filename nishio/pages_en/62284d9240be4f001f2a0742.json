　Learning Motivation Map
　　Technique 1
　 Digging up [motivational] resources
　Route Map
　　Learning Route Map
　　 Technique 3
　　 Draw your own [map of learning
　　 Close to "plan your study."
　　 　Perhaps what most people think of when they say "plan your study" is a quantitative goal like "memorize 10 words every day," but this plan is a "roadmap" plan.
　Pre-map & Post-map
　　Technique 49.
　　Prepare for/establish writing before and after learning.
 　[Concept map]
 　Incidentally, this "concept map" is a technique that is passed over with one line of footnote in the "Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers.

  　The Self-Study Compendium recommends "writing without looking" and what this paper says "didn't work" is "writing while looking", so there's no contradiction there.
   　In other words, it is important to "describe the content of the book you read without looking at the book".
 　[Map from bullet points]
 　 >If the burden of creating a map is too high (for a person), it is acceptable to write down [bullet points] (in short sentences) as much as you know before learning and as much as you remember after learning. However, in the author's experience, a map is better than a bulleted list, because you can pull out better (more) memories by twisting your mind and thinking, "What was the connection to this? Also, even when writing things down, the quality of the memory will be higher if the items are related to each other rather than all lined up in parallel in a bulleted list.
   > Connecting related "concept labels" with each other
   > ... While we are connecting lines and thinking about relationships, we often come up with things that are missing. This is why I believe that a concept map can salvage memory more deeply and pull more out than just bullet points.
　Unknown route map Technique 53
　　This is not a story about a self-taught person making a map, but about how I categorized the "I don't know" into three categories and wrote a countermeasure for each.
