	[resolution of perception of things].
	I thought of an example of over-abstraction of various realities in [incorrect 2].
		[Abstraction is not good.
	I tried to depict the transition between those interpretations.
	1: The state of assuming that there are only two kinds of things
		The state of thinking that only black and white exist in the world.
	2: A state in which one realizes that there is also an in-between.
		The state in which I realized that in addition to black and white, there is also gray.
	3: A state in which one realizes that there are not several kinds of things, but a myriad of kinds.
		A state in which you realize that there is not one kind of gray, but gradations and various kinds of gray.
	4: A state of realization that the two attributes are not in conflict but can change independently
		What you thought was black and white is independent, like red and blue, and there is purple with both and black without both
		[There is more than one axis.]
	5: State where you notice that the value is accompanied by a variance
		Under conditions of [uncertainty], values have variance
		One step beyond this is "the state of realizing that [the distribution] is not necessarily a normal distribution," where the "expected value" and "the value that has the highest probability of occurring" are different

There is a [trade-off between the two attributes] beyond 4.
Might as well put it in a blind spot card.

	>Maybe we can put it in a blind spot card.
	After considering it, I felt that this should essentially be broken up into multiple cards.
	>I had dichotomized the lowest resolution state at the resolution stage, but there's more "I'm equating" --- [two nested concepts that I thought were one concept].
　First there is a point, and then there is the realization that "in a set [that has size, not a point]," which is the base realization of [going backwards, but the goal is the same].
　	[https://gyazo.com/63f10705ddda4e251f8e58f180c2f51b]

　　[assume it's a dot].
　There is a realization that changes from thinking of a set of that size as "one thing" to "two different things," which is [different things belonging to the same thing].
　In the diagram now, there are two followed by three.
　		[https://gyazo.com/994fad428fbe7af23a9086a983e159d7]
　　The realization that you skipped over that and said, "I thought they were two separate things, but they're gradations" [false dichotomy].
　　	[https://gyazo.com/10ad9c1f6cfd2701d0af1a5e0c661869]

　The realization that the system may not be a single axis of 4

　　[false dichotomy].
　　[The axis is not one-dimensional.]
　　[There is more than one axis of strength and weakness.]
　　[No relationship exists between the size of the item and the size of the relationship.]
　As for 5.

　　[Expected value is not the mode]
　　[deviation from the mean and sample size].
　　[average comparison].
　　[Significant differences and gains/losses and variances]

	[Isn't there a size?"]
　[One? Two?"]
　[Are the boundaries clear?]
　[Isn't there a third one?"]
　[false dichotomy]: the diagram has room for improvement, so I didn't put it on top.
　[Isn't there a myriad of them?]
　[I thought there was more than one axis?]
	　>4 not a single axis, but the realization that the system is not a single axis.

　　I think that [expected value is not the mode] is a well-known blind spot, isn't it?
　　　Should we adopt it because so many people are addicted to it, as they often say?
　　I find it surprising to hear that the comparison of averages is not in full order [Efron's Dice].
　　The other two are, well, blind spots.
　　Sometimes the greater the variation, the better."
　　　If you listen to a lot of people's opinions and take an average when the greater the variation the better, it's going to be worse.
　　　The two are connected in terms of
　　Fundamentally nonlinear threshold function effects
　　　So [stochastic resonance] also leads

It was once titled "Resolution of Reality" phase (2019-05-06)
 I tried to link this page on 2021-03-28 and mistook it for "stages of cognitive resolution" [cognitive resolution].
 After thinking about the swing between [resolution of reality and resolution of cognition], I felt that [resolution of perception of things] was better.
 I used "stages of resolution" because "stages of resolution of perception of things" is too long.
