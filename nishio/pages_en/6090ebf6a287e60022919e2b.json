 ** Changes in morning activity style
 
 - ver.1 Alarm → stop and go to sleep → wake up → stop and go to sleep → wake up → stop and go to sleep → wake up → wake up (30 minutes later)
 - ver.2 Alarm → stop and turn on 15 minute timer → fill bath with hot water → go to bed → 15 minute timer goes off → wake up and take a bath.
 -- Winter release
 -- In spring, the vulnerability of "sleeping in the bathtub" was discovered due to the smaller temperature difference.
 - ver.3 Alarm → stop and turn on 15 minute timer → put sesame seeds in rice cooker and knead, etc. → 15 minute timer goes off → take a bath
 -- Innovative design that eliminates the need to sleep twice in the first place
 -- I'll be doing this for a while.

 I'm in the 15 minute challenge phase, but I'm not at the level where I can look at someone's C++ code and point out their mistakes, so I've installed Gyazo.
 I wonder if it is my environment or something is done to prevent me from copying and pasting from the Java program for the competition. ←I wonder if I should ask someone who is using a MacBook to participate in the program.

 End of challenge phase. Let's expose the source code.
 
 The first question is: There is a railroad in the form of a ring-shaped loop, and the time it takes to travel between each station is given. There are two ways to get from one station to another, clockwise and counterclockwise, but we shall take the side that takes the least amount of time. Now, choose the pair of stations on the given loop line that takes the longest time to travel, and answer the time it takes.
 >|cpp|
 typedef long long LL;
 (snip)
   int longestTravel(vector <int> t) {
     LL sum = accumulate(t.begin(), t.end(), 0);
     size_t N = t.size();
     LL maxvalue = 0;
     size_t maxi = 0, maxj = 0;
     for(size_t i=0; i<N-1; i++){
       for(size_t j=i+1; j<N; j++){
 	LL time = accumulate(t.begin() + i, t.begin() + j, 0);
 	time = min(time, sum - time);
 	if(time > maxvalue){
 	  maxvalue = time;
 	  maxi = i;
 	  maxj = j;
 	}
       }
     }
     return maxvalue;
   }
 ||<
 解説。
 First, the time taken counterclockwise is "time for one round - time for a clockwise round", so we first find the time for one round. Then, we just find the time for all pairs and return the maximum value. maxi and maxj were not needed, but it was a waste of time to delete them, so we left them as they were.

 Ah, I just got the results of the system test.

 Wow, that looks like a very common mistake!
 The other 1000 point problem Fail is that the input is somehow <null> when the full limit is received (too long to capture).
 
 -----
 
 Now, a 500 point problem that I got wrong. Given integers s and k, find the largest number that divides s into k pieces and multiplies them together.
 >|cpp|
   long long maximalProduct(int s, int k) {
     LL d = s / k;
     int rest = s - d * k;
     vector<LL> buf;
     buf.insert(buf.begin(), k - rest, d);
     buf.insert(buf.end(), rest, d + 1);
     multiplies<LL> mul;
     return accumulate(buf.begin(), buf.end(), 1, mul);
   }
 ||<
 
 The product is largest when it is distributed evenly. Therefore, we first find the value by truncating the average, and then add one by one the amount that is not enough. I failed to do this for the input 60, 20, which is 3 ** 20. But the question says "You may assume that the answer is within a long long range.
 
 >|diff|
 -    return accumulate(buf.begin(), buf.end(), 1, mul);
 +    return accumulate(buf.begin(), buf.end(), 1LL, mul);
 ||<
 
 orz. it was calculated with the type of the third argument of accumulate... too obvious... I'm not in the habit of paying attention to this kind of thing in Python, which automatically promotes overflows when they occur...
 
 -----
 
 The last 1000 point problem. Given an integer n, find x, y, z such that x * y * z is as close to n as possible. However, a separate list of integers is given, and the integers in the list should not be used.
 
 First, I wrote it in Python. The reason why it is written in a somewhat dirty way is that it is hard to rewrite it in C++ later if it is written in a Pythonic way, since gett usually returns None or result. I thought it was too much trouble to use C++ because of its static type, so I forced Python to use a pass-by-reference style.

 Explanation. First, try to see if n can be divided into a product of three numbers while avoiding prohibited numbers. If it can, return. if it can't, then gradually expand n - 1 and n + 1, n - 2 and n + 2, and so on. the only thing you need to do is to find the one with the smallest difference from n, so return when you find it. the comparison between result and result2 is to determine which one to return if the answers have the same difference. In Python, you can use "result < result2" or something like that.
 
 Now, translate that directly into C++.
 
 >|cpp|
   bool gett(vector <int> a, int m, vector<int> &result) {
     for(int i=1; i<m+1; i++){
       if(m % i) continue;
       if(find(a.begin(), a.end(), i) != a.end()) continue;
       m /= i;
       for(int j=i; j<m+1; j++){
 	if(m % j) continue;
 	if(find(a.begin(), a.end(), j) != a.end()) continue;
 	int k = m / j;
 	if(j > k) break;
 	if(find(a.begin(), a.end(), k) != a.end()) continue;
 	result[0] = i;
 	result[1] = j;
 	result[2] = k;
 	return true;
       }
     }
     return false;
   }
 
   vector <int> getTriple(vector <int> a, int n) {
     int _result[3] = {0, 0, 0};
     vector<int> result(_result, _result + elementof(_result));
     bool got;
     got = gett(a, n, result);
     if(got) return result;
     int d = 1;
     while(!got){
       got = gett(a ,n - d,result);
       if(got){
 	int _result2[3] = {0, 0, 0};
 	vector<int> result2(_result2, _result2 + elementof(_result2));
 	got = gett(a, n + 1, result2);
 	if(!got){
 	  return result;
 	}else{
 	  if(result[0] < result2[0]){
 	    return result;
 	  }else if(result[0] > result2[0]){
 	    return result2;
 	  }else if(result[1] < result2[1]){
 	    return result;
 	  }else if(result[1] > result2[1]){
 	    return result2;
 	  }else if(result[2] < result2[2]){
 	    return result;
 	  }else if(result[2] > result2[2]){
 	    return result2;
 	  }
 	}
       }else{
 	got = gett(a, n + d, result);
 	if(got){
 	  return result;
 	}
 
       }
       d++;
     }
     return result;
   }

 The case that FAILED in the system test was the case where the banned list had everything from 1 to 50. Ah, I see...since they are spread one step above and below n, it takes time to get to the smallest number 51 * 51 * 51 == 132651 that can be made when 1 to 50 are banned, and it times out... I guess I needed to implement "if the smallest number that can be used is more than n squared, return it immediately."
 
 It's something I would notice immediately if I tried it, but I can't notice it because the given test cases don't poke at such things. To eliminate these kinds of failures, I need to be able to add my own test cases for boundary values and such, not just the given test cases.
 
 *1209013876*[cpp]What I learned today.
 - In the STL explanation I was reading yesterday while building boost, I saw "accumulate" in numeric and was glad to use it. This time, there were no strings, but all integers, so I was able to use it to great effect.
 -- accumulate(t.begin(), t.end(), 0); で和がとれる。0 + *(t.begin()) + *(t.begin() + 1) + ...
 -- I got angry when I set t[i] or t + i when I should have set t.begin() + i.

 @makeplex @nishio Why don't we spread Topcorder like this?　http://www.itmedia.co.jp/enterprise/articles/0703/01/news013.html
 @nishio @makeplex I think it would be interesting to spread TopCoder, but it seems counterproductive for me to at least put my face and name forward.
 @nishio What will it take to make TopCoder go viral?
 @bonty @nishio If you want to make it popular in Japan, it should be in Japanese.
 @nishio @bonty I still think we should put together a wiki of commonly used English idioms, "TopCoder's 100 English Example Sentences".

 @nishio @bonty In the meantime, I put a collection of idioms with examples from TopCoder questions on the Wiki > http://tinyurl.com/575kbx

 My Nagatacho commuter pass ran out. I found out that the fare to Tameike-sanno is the same as the one to Nagatacho. If I buy a commuter pass to Tameike-Sanno, Akihabara is also free. I was going to try it, but it was raining, so I decided not to try it.
