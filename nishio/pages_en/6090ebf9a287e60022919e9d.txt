 Found a hot water bottle filled with water. Terrified of what the water inside is doing!
 
 -----
 
 The water had been left at room temperature for more than six months, but surprisingly it was clear.
 
 *1219839065* Got a haircut.
 With a $1,000 thing.
 
 I went to a convenience store because I didn't have a 1,000 yen bill, and bought a WALL STREET JOURNAL because I didn't have anything in particular I wanted to buy, which cost 500 yen.
 
 I am always asked "when was the last time you came for a haircut" (to know how much to cut?). I always ask "when was the last time you came for a haircut?
