Scrapbox Stream
Scrapbox Stream is a great feature when reading a project, but I didn't realize it until very recently!
　That was mainly because I was using this project of mine alone.
　I only did my "writing" and reading by searching or following links when I had something specific to look up.
　　Only "read with a limited audience."
　What's different with Stream.
　　The top page is ordered by newest, but only the page title and a small portion of the opening line are displayed
　　When you open the page, you can see the whole page.
　　With Stream, you can see "the recently updated part of the recently updated page".
　　　When an addition is made to an existing page, only the added portion of the page will be included.
　　　This is just the right feeling
