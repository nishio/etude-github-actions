The path to greatness is with others.

Exchanges will be successful: manners and hobbies will be shared: good sense and even talent will grow unconsciously. And if the bloodthirsty person becomes comrades with the lymphatic and with other temperaments, he will attain the golden mean without being forced to do so. To agree with others is a great art. The alternation of opposites beautifies and sustains the world. If we can bring harmony to the physical world, we can do so even more so in the moral world. We can adopt this policy in choosing friends and defendants, and find a more effective middle path by combining extremes.
