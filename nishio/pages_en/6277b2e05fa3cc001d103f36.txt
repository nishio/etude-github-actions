Share the minutes of the meeting
Share minutes with interviewed creatives.

This is not done as an institution, but is something Nishio does personally.

Why is Nishio sharing the minutes?
　Interviews are not just a place to extract information from creators, but new information can be created through interaction.
　But a creator who is nervous about having to answer questions can't possibly remember the details of a verbal conversation.
　So if you don't share it via text, most of it will disappear, which is a waste.


>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1523324178287718400]: why share the minutes? I explained it lightly in the chat, so I put it all together for the sake of it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1523340910062612483]: As for the specific method, the premise is that I take handwritten notes on my iPad when I listen to a talk, and if I keep the notes as they are, they are not searchable. I then convert the transcribed notes to Markdown, paste them into HackMD, and send them to the creators.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1523341491854520320]: I'm trying to put it into words again, and it sounds like a pain in the ass.... As for taking notes while listening, I do it because if I don't, I forget the questions I'm going to ask, and I take them by hand because I can quickly draw lines to describe the relationships and mark the questions I want to ask.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1523341800240730112]: Personally, I don't feel it's too much of a burden because I'm just doing what I'm already used to and have taken for granted, but if I had to start from scratch But if I try to do it from scratch, it might be a lot of work.
