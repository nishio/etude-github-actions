Interruptions increase time.
Time is extended by [interruption].

Longer tasks receive more interruptions and stretch further.

If the value of a task is proportional to the time required, then longer tasks become less valuable per unit time required because they are longer in an interruptive environment

In other words, in a situation with many interruptions, choosing a short task will result in higher value production per unit of time for the individual than choosing a long task and receiving interruptions, and if the individual is evaluated based on value production, then it becomes rational for the individual to prefer the short task.
