 Even though we could only pull out a hot carpet for two tatami mats, the floor was still out, so signs that were not good (such as one sock falling out) became very noticeable.
 
 **1262708274*[Kaizen] Disposal of expired groceries
 I discarded some unopened sauces and dressings that I received that had expiration dates in 2006. Don't think that you can use them. If you haven't used it before, there is a good chance you won't use it in the future.
 
 I also threw out the mirin and cumin seeds. When did I buy them and for what purpose? There are signs of having used them. I threw these away, too. I think I bought the ingredients to make something, but I think there are two kinds of cooking: to cook something once in a while on a whim, and to keep a constant repertoire of ingredients. Since I am not able to cook the latter, I sometimes buy things on a whim, cook something, and the rest of the ingredients become dead stock.

 I was able to do it.
