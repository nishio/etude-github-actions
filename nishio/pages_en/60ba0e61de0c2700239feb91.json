　Miro is
　Only imported halfway through due to character limit.
　There is no thought to organize information in a limited area, so there is little density of information, with gaps and shadows on sticky notes.
　The font size adjustment is failing and the text is smaller than it needs to be.
　　Simply pasting multiple lines of text will not be imported as a sticky (it will become a text box).
　　　If you paste it into a spreadsheet and then copy and paste it again, it becomes a sticky note.
　Good points about Miro
　　Two-finger swipe on touchpad for parallel movement, pinch operation for zooming in and out
　　　I didn't know you could do this in the browser, I thought the OS gestures took it away.

　Other
　　Miro draws with canvas elements as well as Regroup.
　　Miro seems to have a native app.
