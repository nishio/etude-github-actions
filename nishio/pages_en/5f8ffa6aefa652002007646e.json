　Thoughts.
　　First, I thought of the largest triangle required, then I thought of one smaller triangle from that.

　　Generalizing, (0, 0), (1, 10^9), (10^9, i) for 0 <= i <= 10^9 can express 10^18-i
　　What about something even smaller than that?
　　　(0, 0), (1, 10^9 - j), (10^9, i) can represent 10^18 - j * 10^9 - i
　Official Explanation
　　exactly the same
