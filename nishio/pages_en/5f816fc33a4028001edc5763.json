Listening chat system that does not keep listening
[The "Kikidashi chat system" was initially designed to ask a question for each statement, and later a "listen first" mode was added in which the user could listen to the question without asking a question by simply repeating it.
But this is a global switch between "100% questions" and "0% questions".
Isn't that what we really need?

One-shot question function
　Even in "ask first" mode, if I say, "Do you have any questions?" or "Go ahead," they'll ask a single question.

Question probability up/down
　Increase or decrease the probability of a question
　This may not be straightforward.
　If the user wants you to ask a question and the system incorrectly decides that it doesn't want you to ask a question now, it stops.
　If you're going to do it, I'd rather have an easy-to-understand rule base than complicated content-based guesses.
　　For example, if you wait one second after the user's input and the user makes a new input, you decide that you don't want the user to ask a question now.
　　The above "one-shot question function" is one of the easy-to-understand rules to "clarify when the user wants to ask a question".

If they don't respond all the time, there's no need to limit it to chat.
	For example, if you post a series of tweets on Twitter and then mentions it to the bot, it'll look at the last 10 or so tweets and throw a question at you.
