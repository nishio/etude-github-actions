	When I made a transfer from my bank account to my wife's brokerage account, the brokerage side recently refused to deposit money, whether to prevent money laundering or originally.
	I called the brokerage support to see what to do, and they told me to contact the bank's side and do a "reclassification."
	Pay a reclassification fee and pretend the transfer never happened.
