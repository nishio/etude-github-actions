[Sense of task" and "solvable task" are two different things.
　A vague [sense of the problem] cannot be [solved] as it is.
　We need to find [a problem that can be solved].
　To "[find] out," someone with "insight" needs to "[look] hard.
　　The fuel for this "look closely" is "enthusiasm."
　　Those who have the ability to find out need to observe with enthusiasm as their own, with a sense of empathy for the challenges they face.
　After a solvable problem is found, [ideas] for solving that problem are generated.
　　For example, one person says, "If you can do X like this, it will solve the problem," and another person replies, "X can be solved by using technology Y like this.
　　The discovery of a "solvable problem" and an "idea" can occur almost simultaneously within a single person.
