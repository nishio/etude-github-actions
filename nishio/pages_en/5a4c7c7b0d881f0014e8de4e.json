Organisms are not random trial and error.
 Krechevsky 1932
 An experiment that rats are "learning by testing [hypotheses]" instead of "learning from the results of random [trial and error].
 Let the students learn "the dark side is correct" in a two-choice forked-choice question, and then let them learn "the light side is correct".
  First, choose the dark side, and you'll fail 100% of the time.
  Next, the action to choose a specific side (like the right side) and the percentage of correct answers only goes up to 50%.
  Then comes the action of choosing the bright side.
 Conversely, if a task that cannot be learned is learned with a random mixture of "right side or left side" and "light side or dark side," it will behave for a while, for example, by trying the right side, then trying the dark side this time because it cannot be solved with that side....
