Read but not broken.
	One person's joking answer to the question, "Have you [read] it?
	This is rather interesting.
	in other words
 	Reading" is the defense of [defending, breaking, and separating].
 	If you "[defend]" enough, "[break]" will happen automatically.
 	If you haven't had the "[break]" happen yet, then you haven't read enough.
