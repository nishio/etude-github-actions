　edge
　EDGE of VERBAL and ALINGUAL
　　The [borderline] between the [verbal] and the [nonverbal].
　Translated as "[think at the] margins."
　　A metaphor where the linguistic is in the center and the non-linguistic is on the [periphery].
　Nishio's most commonly used metaphor is the [surface] of the [sea] in "[the] unspoken thing."
　　[iceberg model]
　ドイツ語では[Wo noch Worte fehlen]
　"[Where] there is [still] a lack of words."
　　In Nishio's image, it's where the road called "language" breaks off.
　　[Parable of the Woods].
　　　Image of "the road will be extended in the future, but there is no road yet."
　　I also rather like the forest metaphor.
　　　There is a slight difference between the ocean metaphor and what it means.
　　　The dark forest will eventually be cleared and a path drawn.
　　　　Once the road is drawn, it is no longer "where there is no road yet."
　　　The ocean will not disappear.
　　　　We are not pumping the ocean or lowering the [water] surface.
　　　　I'm taking [fish] from the sea.
