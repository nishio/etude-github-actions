　Thoughts.
　　It seems obvious without having to contemplate it, but I guess I'll have to verbalize it.
　　There is no confluence because it is a tree, which means that vertices that came from the parent with an edge of color X can be painted in any color except X, thereby creating no inconsistency.
　　Minimum number of colors required is the maximum number of vertices
　　Just paint the appropriate vertex as a root.
　Official Explanation
　　I agree
