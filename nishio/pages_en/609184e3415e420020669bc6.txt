ã€€[Recruitment Will Can Must].

Will/Can/Must is often thought as if many people use the same concept, but the Recruit's one is called Can for "what you need to be able to do", and the Cybozu's one is "[It's not the company that decides what you should do, but yourself]", and the three words Even if the choice of the three words is the same, the interpretations are rather diverse.
