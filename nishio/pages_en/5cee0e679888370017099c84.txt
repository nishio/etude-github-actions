Enter Eruda
[liriliri/eruda: Console for mobile browsers https://github.com/liriliri/eruda]
	$ npm install eruda --save
	as (a group, etc.)
	code:html
		<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eruda"></script>
		<script>eruda.init();</script>
	I just do.

	It's super easy and by far the most convenient way I've ever wasted my life.
	TODO [if Eruda is heavy loading, make it a URL option].
