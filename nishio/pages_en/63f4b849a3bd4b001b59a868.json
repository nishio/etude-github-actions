What did you do last week?
　[2023-02-14 Reorganize top page leads].
　I've basically been rotating my weekly journal on Saturdays and Sundays, but last week I had [Unexplored Achievement Report Meeting 2022] on Saturday and Sunday, so I was blown away!
　　I took Monday off, and today, Tuesday, I was busy with another matter.
　　They switch at night.
　Last week, to begin with, I had a paid meeting on Monday that had nothing to do with business, and I allotted Thursday and this Friday to compensate for the day off for the results debriefing on Saturday and Sunday.
　Yes, I had a slight fever of a little over 37 degrees Celsius for three days in a row, so I was not able to make progress.
　　For that matter, the pollen was many times higher than last year at the same time.
　　I don't know if pollen is the cause, but I started taking medicine even if I don't have obvious rhinitis or other symptoms.
　　Rather than fever directly caused by pollen, for example, stuffy nose, poor sleep, swollen throat caused by mouth breathing, etc....

This week, Thursday is the Emperor's Birthday, and you are closed.
　I've been trying to do the organizing I usually do on Saturday and Sunday, but I missed it this week, so now I'm trying to do it, but I just couldn't get my head around it.
　　Let's do it on Thursday.
　　You're simply tired.
　Today, Tuesday, there was a large amount of information input.
　　I'll sort this out tomorrow Wed.

I was looking at the report meeting of the results of the unexplored project, and I was thinking that since it is open to the public and in Scrapbox, maybe I should clip some of it to my Scrapbox and look up words I don't understand.
　Don't be biased towards output.

I put links to pages in my weekly journal that I'll put together on my page after a while, but when I look at them after some time [tasteless list].

　Ten years ago, I thought, "I'll write a book about knowledge that won't be obsolete for the next 10 years."
　Now he felt "I'm not confident that the book will not become obsolete in the next 10 years."
　It has developed a lot in the last few days.
  [work that is pioneering the forest of what has yet to be written].
　To summarize roughly into specific actions
　　use more illustrations
　　　I can't yet express and communicate my understanding in the form of a diagram in a language model.
　　Writing should be concise and easy to understand.
　　　Let the language model validate this.
　　　When I wrote before, I didn't recognize that [being too good at Japanese] was a problem.

2023/2/23
　Tomorrow is Friday already? Isn't it too early?
　Of course, there were activities on Saturday and Sunday, a day off on Monday, and a holiday on Thursday, so three days in effect.
　There was also significant input on Tuesday.
