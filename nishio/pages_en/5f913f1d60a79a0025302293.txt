Bipartite graph with edges as vertices
　A graph can be a bipartite graph with edges (and similar vertex-to-vertex relationships) as vertices
　 That's still fine in terms of finding a connected component.

　This conversion is beneficial when it is expensive to build an edge in Yang
　　For example, "an edge is subtracted when a vertex has a sequence of length M and the two vertices have a number in common."
　　　It costs O(V^2M).
　　　O(VM) when the number is also a vertex.
　　　The number of vertices increases, but it is not important because UnionFind is almost of constant order
　　　It is not generally true that the number of edges is reduced
　　　　The case with fewer constraints [codefestival_2016_final_c].
