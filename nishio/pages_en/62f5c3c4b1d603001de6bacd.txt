Consultants who push unsubstantiated templates.
	The "smart [consultants]" are really very, very smart.
	Such people are a scarce resource, so firms assign them only to their top clients.
	For clients that don't, "smart consultants" assign inexperienced newcomers who are equipped with in-house [templates].
	Therefore, we understand that clients who feel that "consultants push templates that have no basis in reality" were just not good clients for the firm.
