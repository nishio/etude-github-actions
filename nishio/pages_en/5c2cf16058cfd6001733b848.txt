>"I will study English for an hour every day" is an unattainable task. I will study English for an hour every day this year" is a task to be completed on New Year's Eve, which is a little too far from the goal. As the term "three-day monk" suggests, human beings are not good at continuity, so it is doubtful if they can continue for 10 days. First of all, we need to measure how much we can do.

Supplementary explanation of why "studying English for an hour every day" is an [unattainable task].
No matter how many days you do this task, you will still be in a state of "I have to study tomorrow".
It's [a task that] can't be completed no matter how many days you do it. On the other hand, if you fail for even one day, you cannot recover.

If you limit the time period to "this year," it becomes an achievable task because it can be completed if you do it every day until New Year's Eve.
But no matter how hard I try, it will take 365 days to accomplish, and I doubt very much that I will stay motivated during that time.
We call this "[the goal is] too far away.

The closer you get to the goal, the better. The shorter the time period, the closer the goal.
Do it every day for a month, every day for a week, every day for three days."

There is another way to look at it if the period is reduced to one day.
When you say, "I will study one hour every day for n days," when do those n days begin?
Often, don't we unintentionally make it "tomorrow"?

If you want to achieve the goal of "studying for an hour every day for one day," it is faster to do it for an hour now than it is to do it for an hour tomorrow.
Thinking about doing it for an hour tomorrow without doing it for an hour now is just [procrastination].
