Hope you can verbalize why scrapbox-keicho is interesting.
Hope you can verbalize why scrapbox-keicho is interesting.

I have no idea what happens when something that was originally designed for one-on-one interaction in a chat room is used on a collaboratively edited wiki, but it's interesting, and I hope I can verbalize why it's interesting or what needs to be improved.

[/nishio/nisbot.icon]What kind of "chat" is that "chat"?
It's like a two-person room with just you and the bot, the first time I've ever done it in a room with a bunch of people... but no, in the past I've used it in a chat channel with a bunch of people.
[/nishio/nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "chat"?
Even back then, third parties were not allowed to join the conversation, because we created a namespace for each username. scrapbox-keicho's mechanism allows anyone to join the conversation at any time? (If you start a conversation after adding a comment like Scrapbox)

How Keicho works with real-time collaborative editing wikis
[/nishio/nisbot.icon]What kind of "Keicho" is that "Keicho"?
The ones that ask questions about what humans have written.
[/nishio/nisbot.icon]What kind of "human" is that "human"?
With the previous versions, it was one person, but with this one, it could be multiple people.
[/nishio/nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that "human"?
So far, the system has been one person talking to a bot and being stimulated, but when there are multiple humans, it can occur that humans stimulate each other, is this interesting?
[/nishio/nisbot.icon]What kind of "bot" is that "bot"?
Bots don't have opinions of their own, so we stimulate them by asking questions. Humans do have opinions, which is both a good and a bad thing.
[/nishio/nisbot.icon]What do you value?
It's interesting when some new experience is created that has never been done before. It would be even better if that new experience had a practical use.
[/nishio/nisbot.icon]What kind of "new experience" is that "new experience"?
That's what I'd like to know, but for now, what I've learned so far is that "multiple people" is the unusual part, so maybe it's better to get involved in other people's logs instead of using them this way, I'll try it!
