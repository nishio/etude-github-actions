Harmonized average to get the sharpest talent
When making employment selections with multiple assessors with different values
It is easier to get [sharp people] by selecting by [harmonic mean] of ranks than by selecting by [additive mean] of ranks. #Selected

 The fact that the value of rank is [nonlinear] has a significant impact.
  Because of the high concentration of people around the average, the slightest difference in ability will cause a significant drop in the rankings.

 arithmetic mean
  The additive mean places an implicit process where the difference between the 1st and 10th ranks is equal to the difference between the 10th and 19th ranks.
  Assuming there are 100 applicants, person X who assesses that assessor A is ranked #1 and B is ranked #100, and person Y who assesses that both A and B are ranked #50, would judge Y to be superior.
  (10, 100) and (55, 55) are equivalent.
  Those who have sharp abilities and are highly valued only by some assessors will fall.
  It would take a mediocre person that all assessors would consider "better than average".

	harmonic mean
  In the case of the harmonic mean, the difference between first and second place is greater than the difference between second and last place.
  (10, 100) and (18, 18) are about equal.
  This results in a neat evaluation of sharp talent.

It would be interesting to compare which team performs better in the [worst average-oriented environment], when selected by additive average or when selected by harmonic average. Perhaps the team selected by harmonic mean is higher. #Experiments required
