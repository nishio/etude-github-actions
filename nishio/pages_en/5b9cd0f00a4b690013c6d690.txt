	When [nishio.icon] became interested in OKR, he recommended not this book but [Measure What Matters] written by the person who introduced OKR to Google.
	I'm certainly not sure what you're getting at with the storytelling.


	Five Reasons Why You Can't Finish What You're Doing (p. 128)
		Not prioritizing goals.
		Not communicating goals with enthusiasm and without leaks.
		I don't have a plan to accomplish this.
		No time set aside for important matters
		Quit without repeating.

  	>Set one O (Objective) and about three KRs (Key Results) to measure that O, and then the organization and individuals work toward achieving that O.
  　>O or KR should be a difficult goal with about 50% confidence in achieving it.
   	>In return, choose something exciting that the employee would like to be able to accomplish.
   >First, OKRs are set for the company as a whole, and then "departmental OKRs" are created for each department as well. In addition, we regularly review the status of achievement and check with the members to see how much the degree of realization of the O's has increased.
