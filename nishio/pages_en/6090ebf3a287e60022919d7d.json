 *1194074828*Meekly.
 I drink Kuzuneyu and take a bath (yeah?). To nourish myself, I'm going to Sukiya to eat "Negitama Pork Bowl with Negi Tamago (leek and egg), Pork Jiru Salad Set with Tsuyu-madamashi. Now.
 
 *1194081155* I ate and came home.
 It's been an hour and a half since I ate and came home. I did stop by a bookstore or something.
 And I have a headache and heavy sneezing...I guess I'm screwed.
 I guess I'll have to stay home all day tomorrow.
