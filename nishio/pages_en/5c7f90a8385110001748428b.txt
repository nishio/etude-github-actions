People with large subject matter are insecure.
It occurred to me that people who make [subject-matter-large] claims may be [insecure] about their own lives.

Example
 Every person should learn tech X!"
  I chose to learn Technology X, but I'm not sure if I made the right choice, so I'm trying to find supporters and reassurance by making claims like this
  To put it a little more relativistically, when you learn X and think "this is useful, others should learn it too", you should feel that you must find and learn Y as soon as possible because someone who has learned Y that you have not learned yet must be thinking the same thing!
  I feel like there's a pathological narrowing of vision happening where that idea doesn't occur.
 People should all take Problem X seriously!"
  I'm working to solve problem X, but I'm worried that I don't have anyone who agrees with me.
  Wouldn't it be inefficient if everyone considered the same problem?

When you say, "I'm worried that no one agrees with me," do you mean that you want someone to say, "That's a good policy"?
 I am not confident in my proactive choices.
 They want someone else to decide for them.
 [Lack of initiative]
