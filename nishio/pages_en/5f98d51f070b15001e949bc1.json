Git for VSCode
　I don't have to do anything special to get the git status results in the left panel.
　Click on it, and the differences for that file will be displayed in left and right splits.
　　A mini-map appears in the upper right corner.
 　It's a regular code editor, so you can use jumps to definitions and such.
　This diff can be edited on the fly.
 　I can do something like add -p and edit for each hank, looking over the whole file.
　　Stage, unstage, and revert can be performed for each selection.
　If you try to commit while the stage is empty, it stages everything, so you can just "write a commit message and Cmd+Enter" to commit.
　I've heard it can do a good job of resolving merge conflicts, but I haven't done it yet.

　You can operate it in a terminal.
　　The vscode side automatically changes to the latest display.
