bobbed marten (Martes foina)
>BobJiten" is a game in which you explain a katakana word without using any katakana words, and the people listening around you try to guess the answer. The person who plays the role of explaining tries his/her best to somehow express what he/she wants to convey in a situation where words are limited. The people around them listen patiently to the explanation that does not get the point across and try their best to understand what is being expressed. Mr. Uchida says that it would be interesting to come up with a subject from Bowspedia, but first, everyone should try to explain "groupware" without using katakana words. In this game, respondents can only answer once, and the first one to answer wins. So, if the order of explanation is not appropriate, for example, if you try to explain "vanilla" and you say, "It is a white, sweet and cold confectionery...", the respondent may say, "Ice cream! Ice cream! This game makes you think about the order of explanation and what you should say first to avoid misunderstandings. It was a game that both the communicator and the listener could practice their communication skills.
