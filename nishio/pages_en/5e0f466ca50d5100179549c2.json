>Turing Pattern is a spontaneously occurring spatial pattern whose theoretical existence was shown by the British mathematician [Alan Turing] in 1952.
>Turing's interest in using this system of equations to explain the morphogenesis of organisms has long had no impact on biology. However, it has been re-evaluated in recent years, as in 1995 when Shigeru Kondo experimentally confirmed that the pattern on the surface of the body of the striped anemone is Turing's pattern.
