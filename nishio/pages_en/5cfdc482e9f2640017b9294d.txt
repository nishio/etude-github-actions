	I thought I had prevented the same keyword and question combination from appearing, but I think it is.
	Is it my imagination that I don't seem to be getting the multiple keywords crossed out question?

	A question asking for a relation should also be used (b, a) if the question is asked in (a, b)

	Too many questions asking about relationships are rhetorically asked for new keywords that are not specifically delved into.
		Weighted down.
	Because of the strong emphasis on keywords in the immediately preceding statement, it is easy to dig into keywords that appeared in the immediately preceding statement (even if it is the first time they appeared), but it needs to be balanced well. It is not a good idea to dig into only new keywords four times.
		This also lowered the weight
			Originally, the immediately preceding statement was given 10 times more weight than the rest. In other words, if the keyword was not already used 10 times, it could not beat the previous keyword. This setting was just too unusual.
