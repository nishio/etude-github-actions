Rings have overlap.

The two senses of the ring break match the spacing of each of the 10 holes that appear when the board is shifted
So it is possible to transition from "a ring passing through one hole" to four adjacent holes.

From the ring passing through the inner hole, it can transition to the outer hole by rotation of the plate.
The exception is for "short holes".

There are three types of holes on the board: A: short hole, B: hole with a cut on the edge, and C: hole with a cut on the side.
It is ABBCB in clockwise direction. The front and back are the same.

I wonder if this is the key in this C section, as it allows the exit to the side with a deeper entry than in B.

If the front is the direction in which the logo can be seen, this is the view from the back.
