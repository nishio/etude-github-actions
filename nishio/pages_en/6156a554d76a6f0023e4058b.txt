		>Select a range of text and copy text (2D layouts are converted to one-dimensional, and group inclusions are expressed by indentation, so they can be pasted directly into Scrapbox, etc.).

		>ScrapboxI want to copy the title of a kozane, etc. with copy text, and if I can copy it, I can paste it as it is and make a normal kozane.

Textualizing a Selection

ã€€Adjacency cannot be determined by center distance.
ã€€ã€€Use bounding boxes.
ã€€ã€€Cache the bounding box calculation first?
ã€€ã€€[https://gyazo.com/1ad01655b8195c231a475015e1ea2a28]

ã€€Which to choose when there are multiple adjacent items in the one-dimensionalization process
ã€€ã€€Top right to bottom left.
ã€€ã€€However, it does not go back to the upper right corner.
ã€€ã€€ã€€Not traced if either dx or dy is negative

ã€€How to text depends on the expected output format
ã€€ã€€Should be put later than serialization.

 status quo
 Selection display does not scroll

 At least show the whole thing in spaces.
 If you can do this, you can "place it at a magnification that allows you to see what's inside, use the overall zoom to place it in the proper position within the whole, and then go back to the original viewpoint".
