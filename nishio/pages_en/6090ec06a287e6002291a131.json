 I need to clean up my room in preparation for moving, but it's cold and I don't have the motivation, so I end up slacking off. It's pointless. I take a bath and go to bed.

 One of the most memorable things I remember from this year's Prosin was a story about taking three or six months to get a bug out of one of the programs. I don't remember the details of the story, but I guess the important thing is that at the time I thought to myself, "I can't handle that situation right now.
 
 Can you stand to be in a situation where you don't finish what you are building for 6 months and you don't know how much more time you have to finish it?
 
 I suddenly remembered a story about someone completely different. A friend of a friend of mine works in the game industry, and it seems that she is in a situation where she is in charge of a very small part of the game and does not know which part of the overall picture she is in charge of, and where the sense of accomplishment is difficult to obtain for a very long time. I heard how she coped with this situation by doing a task in her spare time called "cooking," which gives her a sense of accomplishment that can be achieved in a few hours. She said that she keeps her spirit up by doing tasks such as baking a cake, which she can recognize her growth and which can be completed in a few hours.
 
 Back to the story, how did he keep his spirit up during the 6 month debugging process? I heard it was an hour a day of soccer, that an hour of physical activity would help him clear his mind of whatever was entrenched in his brain. And he often came up with solutions when he was in the shower after soccer.
 
 Maybe I should have such a "hobby" too.
