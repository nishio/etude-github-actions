 *1357292389*Diary of playing ita-karuta
 This year, I took my wife back to my parents' house in Osaka. When I told my wife about this, she said, "The kids play dominoes with the Hyakunin Isshu," and I was like, "What the heck is this? I told my wife that in her home country, Hokkaido, the Hyakunin Isshu is made of wood. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001CIKHAW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative =7399&creativeASIN=B001CIKHAW">Hyakunin Isshu: A Poem by One Hundred Poets, Playing on a Board</a>.
 
 I searched Amazon and found it for sale, so I bought it right away. The handle is made of wood, and it looks like I can topple dominoes with it.
 
 The characters written on the tag also use <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%89%E4%BD%93%E4%BB%AE%E5%90%8D'>variant forms of kana</a>, which are no longer taught in elementary schools due to the 1900 revision of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Elementary School Ordinance. </a> which is no longer taught in elementary schools due to the revision of the Enforcement Regulations for Elementary School Ordinances in 1900. I thought it would be impossible to actually play with it, but when I showed it to my aunt and uncle, they got very excited and said, "It's fun, let's play with it. When I played with it, I found that it played more decently than I had imagined.

 My aunt and uncle's generation, who are around 60 years old, must have already been around 50 years since they were no longer taught in elementary school, but they seem to be able to read it surprisingly well. Their grandparents were of the generation that normally read and wrote in this script, so perhaps things written in this script were still easily visible to them. For me, the third generation who was not taught this script, it has become something that is only "rarely seen on billboards. It seems that by the time my children's generation comes along, even the signs will be gone. I don't think I'll have a chance to know that they exist.
 
 This year I spent my New Year's break thinking about the rise and fall of culture.

 *1357305321*Theory of Inventive Problem Solving in IT
 The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (<a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ'>TRIZ</a>) is a methodology that tries to make inventions more efficient by "searching for similar problems and their solutions in a database of existing inventions," rather than relying on "inspiration. This methodology is called "TRIZ" (< href='href='_95'>TRIZ</a>).
 
 Simply explained, the problem to be solved is expressed as a "contradiction in characteristics" such as "increase in strength but not in weight. The system then searches for existing patent information that solves the same problem and uses it as a reference. There are auxiliary systems such as the "contradiction matrix," which classifies characteristics into 39 categories and examines 40 typical patterns of solutions from a 39x39 matrix.
 
 However, because of its age (1946-1969), it lacks characteristics related to the information technology that has developed since then. Things like disk capacity and line speed are not on the list of attributes. Can we consider disk capacity as equivalent to "volume"? What does line speed correspond to?
 
 That is why I thought it would be beneficial to re-categorize existing "solution methods" by what contradiction they were trying to solve and what they were trying to improve at the expense of what. For example, a method to solve the problem of insufficient storage capacity at the expense of completeness of information would be to use lossy compression such as JPEG or <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3 %83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BF'>bloom filters</a>.
 
 There's a <a href="http://www.osaka-gu.ac.jp/php/nakagawa/TRIZ/jforum/2007Forum/MishraTextbook/Chapt4J-080204.pdf">previous study</a> that aims to do the same thing. I'm uncomfortable with <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADSL'>ADSL</a> being classified as "asymmetric" along with the design of the mouse pointer and the mouse itself. I don't feel that being called "asymmetry" solves the problem when you have the contradiction of wanting to increase the speed of the line, but increasing the speed reduces reliability. To me this looks like a way to "improve average performance by allocating more resources to things that are used more frequently". It's a companion to the <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%95%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E7%AC%A6%E5%8F%B7'>Huffman code</a>.
 
 When one wants to reduce computation time, one can sacrifice memory space and "compute on typical inputs first". This is akin to prefetching or speculative execution in terms of "doing it first," and caching or memoizing in terms of "sacrificing storage space to save it for later use.
 
 (I will add more as I think of them)
