Incompatible ideas.
If you think you have an idea A and [incompatible idea] B that you have

In the first place, since the inside of another person's brain is [unobservable], the idea that "the other person has idea B" is a hypothesis that you [interpret] from [observed fact], which may or may not be true.

So first, this hypothesis may be wrong.

Second, the idea that "A and B are [incompatible]" could be wrong.
For example, if you insist on a black circle and the other party insists on a white square, at first glance they seem incompatible. However, if you listen carefully, you will find that the other party is more concerned about the square and less concerned about the color, while you are more concerned about the black color and less concerned about the shape. Then, if you make a black square, both parties will be satisfied.
It is common [to assume that what you value should also be valued by the other party].

Next, there are cases that are indeed incompatible, but are simply [discrepancies in observed facts], and [conflict] can be resolved by simply [sharing information] with each other. In the diagram, the opinion that the majority of the facts are white is incompatible with the opinion that the majority of the facts are black. However, this is simply a difference in the referenced facts.
