Importing Twitter into Scrapbox
Go to Twitter Settings, "Request All Tweet History" and wait for a while, then the download link will be emailed to you.

Be careful when you unzip, it will be extracted to the same location as the zip without digging the directory.

I had made a conversion script before, but after about a year, I changed my mind about the preferred conversion method, so I'm reworking it.

A year ago I tried to add the ability to automatically turn keywords into links.
	Now I'm not a fan of automatically turning keywords into links.
	If all the keywords were to be links, that would be the same result as if you had searched for them on the search page.
 There is an optimal state between the extremes of "no keywords are linked at all" and "all occurrences of that keyword are linked."
 Automatic linking does not yield optimal results.

Last time I made a page for each tweet, but not preferable.
	Difficult to see tweets before and after, so context is disjointed.
 Grain size is too fine.
 I think it's better to put it together on a day-by-day basis.
	Sort in order from oldest to newest
	I was going to put the time on each Tweet, but the Tweet older than a certain date doesn't contain the data of the posting time.

I checked this time and it was possible to delete the project and then create a new project with the same name.
