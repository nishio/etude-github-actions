Original statement [Twitter https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1050200418439974912]
>There are no circumstances unique to writing, it is just that "intellectual production is difficult to estimate in advance" just like any other task. It is essentially the same as software development or research management. And "difficult" in "difficult to estimate" is not "impossible" but "open to improvement through ingenuity."

Context: [writing and scheduling].

[Difficult does not mean impossible.
