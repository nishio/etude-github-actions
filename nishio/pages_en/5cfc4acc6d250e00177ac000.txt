	We have been having weekly meetings according to the following templates.
		Previous Scheduled Links
  	Hours.
   what to do
  How much time you have spent from the previous meeting to now
  What has been done from the previous meeting to now?
  What are you having trouble with now?
 	When is the next meeting?
 	How much time you plan to spend before the next meeting
  What is planned to be done before the next meeting

	2019 "Isn't this too administrative?" I'm starting to get the feeling that
	Hard "what do you plan to have done by the next meeting?"
	Depends on the personality of the person you're dealing with.
		Type 1
 		I'll do A."
 		→I'll give it a shot and see if B looks good.
 		→I'll do a B.
 		→We were going to do A, but we did B!"
 			I have no problem at all with this type of thing.
 	Type 2
 		I'll do A."
 		→I'll give it a shot and see if B looks good.
 		→But I told the teacher I was going to do A."
 		→ Do A while thinking B looks better.
 		→I did A, but I think B is better."
 			This is not good.
	There is no consensus in the first place that "plans are subject to change."
		We need to make a clear consensus.
