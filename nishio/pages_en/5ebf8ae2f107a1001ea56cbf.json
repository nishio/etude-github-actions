You think you're awake, but your body is asleep.
I got some interesting data. I woke up in the middle of the night, not consciously sleepy, but active, thinking "I went to bed early..." During that time, my heart rate was dropping rapidly and eventually reached the same level as when I was asleep. When I returned to the futon, I immediately fell into a deep sleep.
