 *1311767572*QUMA and the Unexplored
 Have you all seen the <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ny7xmCGu80'>QUMA video</a> yet? Developed by a Japanese venture, and despite the lack of an English press release, it was quickly <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/quma-3d-motion-capture-figure-for-3d -cg-production-video/2011/07/21/gIQAx2gIRI_story.html'>The Washington Post</a>, etc.

 I was watching QUMA on Twitter because it was interesting to observe the impact of QUMA spreading around the world, and then I found this statement:
 
 >>
 QUMA was originally organized by a person introduced to me by Mr. Nishio, whom I met at Hackers Cafe, so I think it is fair to say that QUMA originated from Hackers Cafe.

 This is true. There is a long history that only those who are involved in the process of creating something know about, and we want to cherish each and every one of these facts.

 Well, I never thought I would be mentioned. Thank you for saying that even though I am an outsider. If I recall, I was the one who guided the group of unexplored alumni to visit 3D-GAN. It must have been 3 or 4 years ago. I think it was after the debriefing session of the "Unexplored Youth" in Akihabara.
 
 The IPA has been holding "Boost Conferences," in which the adopters are gathered in one place and accommodated, in order to create a network among them. The IPA has been holding "boost meetings" where the adopters are gathered in one place to stay overnight in order to create a network among the adopters. IPA has also invited alumni to attend the Boost Conference with the aim of "creating a path that spans the year of adoption". If there had been no Boost Conference, if I and Mr. Kuikei had not been invited to the Boost Conference, the two of us would never have gotten to know each other. If I had known that Mr. Kuikei wanted to use a 3D printer to make the joints for the QUMA prototype, I would not have said to him, "Well, there is a 3D-GAN right there. There are many amazing people in the development team that I met through Unexplored. Without Unexplored, they would never have met and QUMA would never have been completed.
 
 It has been about 10 years since I joined Unexplored. At that time, I did not realize how important networking was. However, I believe that a project can grow into a big tree only with a network that is spread out like roots. I am grateful that the IPA has continued the "Unexplored Project" to create a product that Japan can be proud of to the world. I am very glad that the project was not discontinued due to the project sorting. And I am very happy to be able to participate in the <a href="http://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/renkei/spcamp2011/">Security & Programming Camp</a>, a project that will weave a network of young people for another 5 years or so beyond the Unexplored Project. I am very happy to be a part of this project. Since they are 5 years younger than I was when I did Unexplored, it may be difficult to see the results unless we look at it over a longer period of time, about 15 years. Still, it is very important to continue such projects.
 
 I think that we are no longer in the mindset of "I am in an organization," but rather in the age of "there is a community between myself and others. And it is through these communities that people connect with each other and create a network that creates value.

 One such opportunity to build a community is the Unexplored Project. The open call for new people started last week! Please give it a try! <a href='http://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/index.html'>Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan: Unexplored: Unexplored IT Human Resources Discovery and Development Project</a>.
