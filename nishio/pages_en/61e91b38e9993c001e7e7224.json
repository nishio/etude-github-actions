(4.1.1) Purpose of reading a book
First I divide the purpose of reading into three: [entertainment], [finding information], and [assembling information] to build your understanding.

 [(4.1.1.1) Entertainment is out of scope]
 [(4.1.1.2) Is the purpose to obtain information?]
 [(4.1.1.3) History of information transmission]
 [(4.1.1.4) Assemble one-dimensional information in the brain]
 [(4.1.1.5) Only the content of the book is not a box to build understanding]
 [(4.1.1.6) Gradation between "Finding" and "Assembling"]
