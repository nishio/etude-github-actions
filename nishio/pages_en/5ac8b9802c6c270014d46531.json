I don't have time.
	Interpretation of "no time."
	Is that a fact?
	First, we need to measure how much time is actually spent on what.
	Get the facts straight.
 Measurement is required before tuning

	Maybe it's not that we don't have time, maybe we just don't have enough [triggers] to think about using our time for it.
