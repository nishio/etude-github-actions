Benefits of Inequality
unexplored junior
 127 applications, 12 selected, up to 500,000 in funding for each project

[Competitive funding is always [unequal
 We don't give out money to all applicants.
　If you give out money equally to all applicants?
　　50,000 yen per person
 	If you can get $50,000 just for submitting an application, more qualified people will apply.
 	There are 3 million high school students nationwide.
   If everyone applies and distributes equally, 2 yen per person -> nothing done.

Unequal distribution is better [cost-effective].
