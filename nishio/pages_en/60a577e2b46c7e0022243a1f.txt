The "end of the hierarchy" is nonsense.
[What will govern tomorrow] p.11
>Today we hear a lot of "end of the hierarchy". This is nonsense. Every organization needs a boss as the highest authority. Every organization needs someone who makes final decisions and has followers. In the event of a total crisis, which every organization will encounter sooner or later, the fate of the organization will depend on the existence of a clear mandate.
> When a ship is about to sink, the captain does not hold a meeting. He gives orders. To save the ship, everyone obeys that order. Opinion and participation are irrelevant. In a crisis, hierarchy and obedience are the lifeline.
> Moreover, the same organization sometimes needs a discussion, sometimes a team.
