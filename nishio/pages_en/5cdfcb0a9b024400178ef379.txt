Assessing the usefulness of learning techniques
A study examining and comparing the usefulness of 10 different learning techniques
[https://gyazo.com/844f1803af17ade1cf422c2a977f3b23]
Practice testing and distributed practice, which were considered highly useful, were also explained in [The Intellectual Production of Engineers].
	Testing: [(3.4.1) Testing is a means of memory].
	Spacing out learning: [(3.5.1) Review after forgetting].
 Practice testing: Self-testing or taking practice tests over to-be-learned material
 Distributed practice: Implementing a schedule of practice that spreads out study activities over time

Those with medium usefulness
	Elaborative interrogation: Generating an explanation for why an explicitly stated fact or concept is true
		Explain why it is right.
	Self-explanation: Explaining how new information is related to known information, or explaining steps taken during problem solving
		Explain the relationship to other information and the derivation process
		Writing a commentary in [Scrapbox] is going to be a commentary on how it relates to other information.
	Interleaved practice Implementing a schedule of practice that mixes different kinds of problems, or a schedule of study that mixes different kinds of material, within a single study session
		Mixing different types of learning objects
