Contain opinions that reduce choices and increase options.

　We're not trying to increase [diversity of opinion], we're trying to increase [diversity of choice].
　Therefore, "opinions that reduce others' options" can be contained.
　In response to this, some people say, "You want diversity, but you don't respect the opinions of those who disagree with you?", which is a misguided objection that does not distinguish between "diversity of opinion" and "diversity of options".
