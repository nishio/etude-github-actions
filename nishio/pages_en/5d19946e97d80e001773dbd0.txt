Deletion Functions
	Click on a sticky→[Balloon menu]→[Delete].
	When you click on a group, it opens and closes.
		Open and close, but also serve menus?
	Pass?
		Balloon menu with lasso selection

	Implemented by [lasso selection -> delete].
		If the balloon menu from the lasso selection can be used to delete the sticky, there is no need to delete the sticky itself.
		However, I think [balloon menu instead of sticky click to open/close] is fine.
