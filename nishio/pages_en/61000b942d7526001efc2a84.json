		review
		>I read this work more than 10 years ago and was surprised to see a Japanese psychologist doing something like running "[evolutionary psychology]". The author says that emotions were adaptive for "primitive man" using his own [theory of emotion] called [Urge Theory].
  > This would be a mainstream evolutionary psychologist in modern America, who would say that for hominids in a primitive adaptive environment, emotions would have had adaptive value as a primary information processing and response that did not need to be "tried". What you are saying is exactly the same, but the terminology is different.
  > The author's theory can be appreciated as original, but, in any case, he does not cite any application of sociobiology to people until the 1980s, such as Edward Wilson's "[Sociobiology]" (1975), Daley and Wilson's "[When People Kill People]" (1988), etc. since the 1990s, Despite the fact that the ideas were the same as those of evolutionary psychology that continue to the present day, their sums are not cited by modern researchers, as is the case with Takakazu Seki. This is a symbol of the current state of Japanese academia, and is very unfortunate.
