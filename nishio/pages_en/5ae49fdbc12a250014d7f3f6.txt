change leader
	What leads to change
 Since [Drucker] expressed that "the more an organization becomes a change leader, the more it needs to establish continuity, and the more it needs to be in harmony with change and continuity.
 	Are there places where change leaders are treated as "people"? There are places where it is written as if it could be a person or an organization.
