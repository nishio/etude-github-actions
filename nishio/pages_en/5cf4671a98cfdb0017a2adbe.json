Find the angle from x and y
[https://gyazo.com/a5c611538e2171849e4d0ca459568cec]
	Converting an angle to a ratio of x and y is tangent
	Conversely, converting the ratio of x and y into an angle is arc tangent
		Also written as [$ \tan^{-1}] or atan depending on the environment

	However, since [$ \frac{y}{x} = \frac{-y}{-x} ], this method also identifies points 180 degrees opposite
		Same reason why the tangent graph is 180 degree periodic.
	If you want to restore 360 degrees
		Information is lost when the ratio is taken, so the information before the ratio is taken must be used.
		For example if (x > 0) ... else if (x == 0 and y > 0) ... else if (x == 0 and y < 0) ... else if (x < 0) and divide into cases
