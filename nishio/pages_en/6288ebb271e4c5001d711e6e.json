Diary 2022-05-21
Let's take it easy today.

　A: KJ method study group exchanges.
　B: Consider introducing [pin-diary-X] to this project
　C: Consider Scrapbox backups for other projects
　D: Porting past articles written for shared projects here
　E: Create a landing page for people new to this Scrapbox.

C to E are ambiguous and huge tasks

[/villagepump/mystery of declining well pages].
　Get backup of villagepump
　I went so far as to check the difference.
　I'm relieved to know that what I wrote doesn't seem to have been erased.
　　But that doesn't change the point that anything you write in a collaborative project can be erased at any time, so you should back it up yourself if you don't want it to be erased.

B: Consider introducing [pin-diary-X] to this project
　I didn't customize the template, but I got it to work.
　I customized the template to work.

 Ask for an hour who is the one who got sick due to lack of sleep...don't...just go to sleep (4:20).
 I got plenty of sleep (but I'm told it's not enough).

　　Oh, but I slept for two hours in the evening when I forgot to put my Apple Watch on, so I guess that adds up.
　[Pikmin Bloom], it's a 10,000 steps walking day and it's raining!
　　I heard it was sunny in the morning (my wife was cleared).
　Find out how to install [pin-diary-6
　I figured out the bundled scripts, but I didn't know what to do if I wanted to change the makeDiary or change the target project.
　　What is [scrapbox-bundler.vercel.app]...
　　This or [scrapbox-bundler].
		I wonder if I can copy [pin-diary-6/template] and [pin-diary-6] to my project, rewrite them, and then bundle them.
　Looks like a bundle is ready.
　　I looked at the list of files you're reading and confirmed that it's not a villagepump, but an import from takker99/scrapbox-userscript-std or something like that.
　Now I just need to change the format to my liking...
　No `ReferenceError: lightFormat is not defined`.
　　Ah, you've bundled the deps and template implementation into one when you move it.

		I was able to do it!

　If we had a bundler that would cache the bundle results for 10 years or so until we explicitly refreshed them, we wouldn't have to put the bundled code in Scrapbox!
　It stopped raining [Vibram walking].
　　I also want a medal for [Pikmin Bloom].
　　Let's walk far away and fill the neighborhood with [fog of the world] so it doesn't rain again.

　　It looked to me like he was saying, "That way.

　Yay!

　I'm sleepy after dinner.
　When I was writing the introduction to pin-diary, I was thinking that if you import script Y in X from UserScript in an unlocked collaborative editing project X, there is a possibility that malicious code could be put in Y, so even if you cut out the template part, putting it in X is dangerous.
 　Well, in this case, the problem is the "unlocked" part.
 [/nishio/pin-diary-X]I wrote an introduction memo.
 　I'm not sure what you mean by the deps being split into separate files.
 　If there is a plan to change the template in the future, I thought it would be easier to use launch as the entry point of the bundle and inject the template written in JS for trial-and-error.
