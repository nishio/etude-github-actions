Two seemingly contradictory movements
Two seemingly contradictory movements can be explained by the low resolution of the starting point concept, which, when separated, can be explained in a consistent manner on an axis different from the axis we are currently focusing on.

[In "From Work to One Job" in "The KJ Method: Let Chaos Speak for Itself," the author asks, "Why are there situations in which escaping from [work] is worth living for, and situations in which [work] is worth living for? In his discussion, he divides "work" into two categories: "[work]" and "[a task].

　In this figure, there is a movement V from A to B and vice versa, and a movement U from B to A, seemingly [contradictory].
　　Appears to move in the opposite direction on the implicitly assumed axis X
　But that is because [the resolution] of concept A is low.
　Take a closer look at concept A and find P and Q in it.
　V is movement from P to B, U is movement from B to Q
　　This is a movement in the same direction on axis Y

　[The "opposite but the goal is the same" is also about "seemingly contradictory movements".
