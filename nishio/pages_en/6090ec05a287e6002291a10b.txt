 Some people don't seem to understand it when I explain it in code, so I'll explain it in Japanese. The following code has two appendices.

 ['='.join((k, v)) for k, v in sorted(d.items(), key = lambda x: x[0])]

 First, the comparison of large and small between tuples is done lexicographically using the comparison results of each corresponding element. Therefore, this part is meaningless.
 
 >|python|
 ['='.join((k, v)) for k, v in sorted(d.items(), key = lambda x: x[0])]
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Second, it is pointless to disassemble something that can be obtained as a tuple and then tuple it again.

 The answer is "yes". Personally, I don't like to join two elements that are fixed to be two elements, so there are four ways to write it by combining "whether to replace it with a string formatting operation" and "whether to use sorted(d.items()) or sorted(d)", but in the last article, I forgot to include the above writing style that is closest to the original.
