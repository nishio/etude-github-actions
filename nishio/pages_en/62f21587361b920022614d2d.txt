The "Interesting" Exploration Net
Work to explore and visualize one's mind on the question "What do I find interesting?

Q: Why the theme "What do you find interesting?
　It is important to understand and verbalize "my values" in building a long-term career without being distracted by immediate tasks
　However, when asked to "put values into words," most people cannot, because the word "values" is highly abstract.
　So, you can start by collecting specific "interesting" and "not-so-interesting" things and find out from there

way
　'What do I find interesting?' and write in the middle
　From there, associative branches extend in all directions.
　　Write about anything that comes to mind, not just examples you find interesting.
　Ensure that the branches are reticulated.
　Once a large lump of netting is created, surround it with two or three pieces at a time (island-dori) and add a "nameplate" describing the lump.
　Repeat this process to reduce the number to less than 10.
　As you look at it, ask yourself, "What do I find interesting?" and put it in writing.

What others have tried
	I feel like you're stumbling over my lack of explanation, so I need to improve my explanation.
	　This page doesn't tell you how to use Kozaneba at all.
	　 Because Kozaneba isn't essential to doing "interesting expeditions online."
	　 I'm planning to use Miro in [KJ method study group @ loftwork_lecture material v1] and
	　Need a "how to do an interesting expedition net in Kozaneba" type of explanation.
