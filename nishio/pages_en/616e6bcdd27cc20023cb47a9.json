Suggestion of what 100 out of 100 people want
In a chat session at Unexplored Junior, the topic was "Can a proposal for something that 100 out of 100 people want pass?" I thought it was an interesting topic, so here are my thoughts on the subject.
The MEXT JUNIOR program does not have a unified criteria for selection, and evaluations are made on a variety of axes at the discretion of the mentors.

If at the proposal stage it says, "100 out of 100 people will want this software.
　I think "you don't know if 100 people out of 100 actually want it until you put it on the market.
　So I'd probably skip over that part of the claim, judging it to be "baseless and subjective".
　I'm sure when they ask questions in interviews, etc., they'll prioritize digging into other areas.
　If I were to delve into this part, I would ask, "What makes you think that '100 out of 100 people would want it'?" I would ask.
　　I'll ask, and if specific facts come up, I'll give feedback saying, "You should clearly state those things in your proposal, the way you're writing it now makes it look like an unfounded fantasy.

Common mistakes
　[** If it's $0,] 100 out of 100 people will want it.
　　For example, Maple Leaf gold coins
　　　If it's $0, most people want it.
　　　Anyone can get it for 20-30 thousand dollars.
　　　Few people paid 20-30,000 to get gold coins.
　Students and professionals tend to have different senses regarding the exchange ratio of money and time
　　For example, if you have "what you can get if you pay 10,000 yen or work for 5 days.
　　For a student whose annual allowance is 60,000 yen, "10,000 yen is two months' worth of spending money."
　　　Tend to think "10,000 yen is expensive, better to work 5 days during summer vacation"
　　For a working person who works 20 days a month and earns a salary of 200,000, "10,000 yen is one day's salary."
　　　Tend to think, "It's hard to work for 5 days, I'd rather pay 10,000 yen."
　　　(I'm ignoring living expenses, etc., to simplify the story. In reality, living expenses are subtracted and a person with 200,000 would be judged more like a student. On the other hand, for someone earning 800,000 a month, 10,000 yen is a couple of hours.)
　Students tend to underestimate their own work time because money is scarce and time is plentiful
　　as a result
　　　We tend to ignore the option of paying to get it.
　　　I tend to offer suggestions that I offer cheaply by doing my own labor for $0.00.
　　'We don't have these things, so we'll make them!' 'No, I can usually buy that if I pay for it...aren't you just ignoring the option of paying for it?'
