 Rain.

 It's raining, so I can't take a walk.

 iGoogle has a gadget called "Sticky Notes" that is supposedly useful for taking small notes. I can write down what I'm going to do when I get home from work and look at it at home. You can also share stickies with others.

 Mercurial is said to have short source code, and Kai is also said to be short. I also heard that Kai is recommended for studying Erlang because it is very clean.

 The <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/427'>ScrapBook :: Firefox Add-ons</a> I wrote last time can also be searched locally.
 
 Documents saved locally can be edited. Sticky notes can be posted! You can even mark them. You can drag and drop edits to the finder and pass them on to others. Saved files can be opened in both IE and Safari! Links are also live!
 
 ScrapBook is too awesome.
 
 Wow, that's too awesome. You can even "follow a link from a specified page to how many steps to save" or something like that! http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbook.htmlをとりあえず1段階リンクたどるモードで保存してみた!
