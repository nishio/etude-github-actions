Why do you use a space for line breaks before Embedding?
The sample code at [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings OpenAI API] says this
code:python
 def get_embedding(text, model="text-embedding-ada-002"):
    text = text.replace("\n", " ")
    return openai.Embedding.create(input = [text], model=model)['data'][0]['embedding']

Why is replacement necessary when whitespace and line breaks themselves are different tokens? Is it really necessary? I was skeptical, but I found a statement that it was because the replacement would improve the result.
　>Replace newlines with a single space
 > Unless you're embedding code, we suggest replacing newlines (\n) in your input with a single space, as we have observed inferior results when newlines are present.

No follow-up exam.
　I doubt if it's the same in Japanese.
　but I'm inclined to follow it.
