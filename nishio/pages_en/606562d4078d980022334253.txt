Pope's law
Unless it is explicitly stated that it is a joke, it is impossible to make a parody of a radical claim in a way that no one will mistake it for being serious.
Without a blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of extremism or fundamentalism that someone won't mistake for the real thing.
[Poe's Law - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%81%AE%E6%B3%95%E5%89%87]

[Joking] means that unless you specify that it is a joke, someone will take it seriously.
The interpretation that "it should be understood as a joke even if it is not explicitly stated" is incorrect.

If B takes seriously a statement that A made with the belief that "it should be understood as a joke even if it is not explicitly stated," it appears to A that B is mistaken, but to third party C, this phenomenon is caused by the fact that A neglected to mark the statement as a joke based on the mistaken belief that "it should be understood as a joke even if it is not explicitly stated," and it appears that A is mistaken. However, to third party C, it appears that the mistake was caused by A's negligence in granting the joke mark based on the erroneous belief that it should be understood as a joke without being explicitly stated.
