 It was an eye-opener. In my mind, "taking in the laundry" and "preparing for tomorrow's meeting of the Young Scientists in Information Science" were completely independent tasks, but when I broke down "preparing," it included "putting a change of clothes in my bag," so "taking in the laundry and putting it in my bag" is a smarter task. I hadn't realized this until you pointed it out.

 <body>My name is Morisaki from Nara Institute of Science and Technology, one of the organizers of this event. Thank you for your interest, I came here via Twitter. <BR><BR>I also wanted to use an editor, IDE, tools, etc., but for various reasons I gave up this time. <br><br>I also wanted to use an editor, IDE, tools, etc., but decided not to this time for a number of reasons. <br><br><br>They also felt that it would be difficult to prepare equipment from our side, and that if the number of participants decreased, it would not be possible to make statistical judgments, and thus it would not be a viable research topic. <br><br>We are wondering if there is any way to improve the situation. If it is possible to gather about 100 people even if we use our own PCs, we would definitely like to try it next time. </body><br><br>I am wondering if there is anything we can do to improve the situation.
