Empathy for diversity and vision
	Empathy with [the vision]" is the distance between people and the campfire (=vision).
		Some are near and some are far.
		Related: [alignment].
	Diversity" is the distance between people.
		Those "far from the campfire" are also far from this distance
		But even between "people close to the campfire" there can be distance.
		People who "don't share the vision very much" are far from "people who share the vision very much."
			In that sense, a situation where people don't share the vision is highly diverse.
			The "low sympathy for the vision -> high diversity" is valid.
			The statement "high diversity → low empathy for the vision" does not necessarily hold true.
		Create a situation of "high empathy for the vision" and "high diversity."

>I'm talking about the difference between diversity and [values]. I realized this when I was managing the community. Once you decide on the values of the community, you should also decide on the policies behind them. Clarify what is right and wrong in the community. Otherwise, the values you have defined as values will be shaken.

The original tweet argues that "distant boundaries should also be clearly defined."
　Clarify the boundaries that separate the inside and outside of the organization
　I'm not interested in that.

It is interesting that a single chart vividly illustrates that "values" (degree of empathy with the vision) and "diversity" can be compatible.
