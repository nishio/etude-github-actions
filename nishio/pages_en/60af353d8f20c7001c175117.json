Can do anything" is a dangerous sign.
[nishio.icon]Trying to make "I can do anything" a point of appeal is a dangerous sign.
　For example, as an extreme example, if you buy a "game console that can do anything" and it says, "I don't have any game software right now, but if you write a program, you can do anything," that's not what I'm talking about.
　To put it a little more firmly.
　　Most customers don't want "tools," they want to get their "[errands] done.
　　So pick the one that costs the least to run an errand.
　　When it comes to "a console that can play any game with a little study and implementation" and "a console that can start playing games right now," most people would choose the latter.
　Some people interpret the change from galaga-kei to smartphones as "smartphones were preferred by users because they can do anything if you make an app for it," but I think differently[nishio.icon].
　 There are a few people who are interested in it because they can "do anything," but that's about the same amount of people who are building and playing with RaspberryPi right now, and that's only a small percentage of the population.
