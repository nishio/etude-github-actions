I really like this diagram.
I have been working on [KPT] until now.
	[Keep]
	[Problem]
	[Try]
I recognized it as a tasteless list of three words.

What's good about this diagram

Arranging them like this clarifies the time frame.
	Decide [Try]=[Next Action] for the current [Problem
	The next time you look back, you know the result of that Try.
 	Of those that produced good results, those that will be continued next time go into Keep.
 		Stop what is not worth continuing.
 		I like that it's explicitly stated to stop.
 	Those that did not produce good results are naturally accompanied by some kind of Problem.
 		Problem can spontaneously disappear over time.

So, I was inspired by this diagram and added some things.

I had a lot of fun and painted a lot of things.

I drew too much and the diagram was messy. Not good. Explanation:.
	[Problem] is the gap between [Reality] and [Vision]: [Problem solving method] [Problem is the gap between ideal and reality]
	Pulling Reality into Vision is [Creative Tension]: [Learning Organization].
	It is the negative belief that pulls in the opposite direction. SEE: [Ideal, reality and helplessness].
	Problem-solving methods consider multiple causes of reality and focus on those related to people
	Negative beliefs are part of [policy constraints], [constraints]: [theory of constraints].
	When Reality is a Problem, the action to get out of it is Remedy, and the place you want to reach after getting out is Outcome, which is a concept similar to Vision: [PRO Model].
	Put it in the [PDCA cycle] and look back after Do. Keep corresponds to Again, and stop corresponds to Abandon.
