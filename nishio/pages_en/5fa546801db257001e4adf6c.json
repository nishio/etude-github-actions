	[$ \sum_{x:0<x<N} f(x) = \sum_x f(x)[0<x<N] ]
	Personally, I didn't like Kronecker's delta and indicator functions because they were hard to read, but I thought this notation was nice because it didn't make it too hard to read.
	ã€€When neither True nor False has a non-zero value, it is easier to read if it is written in pieces rather than put together (B below).
			A: [$ (x < 0 ? -1 : 1)]
			B: [$ -1[x<0] + 1[x\ge0] ]
		 C: [$ 1 -2[x<0] ]
		 D: [$ -1\delta_{x<0} + 1 \delta_{x\ge0}]
			E: [$ 1 - 2\delta_{x<0}]
