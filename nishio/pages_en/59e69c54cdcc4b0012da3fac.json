>I have finally come to understand that Go is a dialogue. I have come to think, "I'll take this side, you take that side. Until now, all I could think about was annihilating the enemy, and all I could do was kill everyone.

	an interesting likeness
  A good example of the characteristics of Go.
  It is common to try too hard to defeat an enemy, only to have the enemy take advantage of your weakness and defeat you.
 	Go is a game where you should score 51 points, not 100
		The fact that he called it "dialogue" in one word is quaint.
		In other words, it can be taken as an assertion that "dialogue is a game in which one side is mine and the other side is yours, without aiming for a perfect score of 100 points.

 Sentence structure is interesting
  If you use the analogy "A is like B," an explanation of B usually follows. The purpose is to explain A, which is difficult to understand, with B, which is easy to understand.
  This time, however, I am explaining A.
  Since "A=B" for the speaker, of course it is valid if "B=A" is used in place of "A=B".
  I have a feeling there might be something interesting here.
