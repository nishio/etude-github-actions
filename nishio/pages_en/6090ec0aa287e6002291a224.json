 *1335666352*I want to change slides uploaded to Slideshare.
 I can't find my uploaded slides to begin with? I was lost for a while. Before I knew it, when I went to my account page, the news feed appeared. If you want to see the list of your uploaded slides, first select "my uploads" from the menu in the upper left corner. Then you will see a list of slides and an "Edit/Delete" link, so just click on it and replace presentation.
