Should be drawn in update descending order
It was designed that way from the beginning, but it was temporarily turned off during this [redesign of how items are held] process, so I captured what happens if you don't do it.

As a metaphor for the "movement of things," it is natural for things that have been moved and placed to come to the forefront.
This is achieved by drawing in descending order of modification time, where "the last updated is drawn last".
If we do not do that (i.e., the order in which things are generated), the drawing will look like this video.
The sticky note will always be at the very back.
