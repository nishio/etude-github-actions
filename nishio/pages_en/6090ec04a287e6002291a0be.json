 *1275401239* iPad has lower resolution than iPhone
 When I took the data created on the iPhone and brought it directly to the iPad, it was spaced out by about 20%. The iPhone is 3.5 inches diagonal and 480x320 pixels, while the iPad is 9.7 inches diagonal and 1024x768 pixels. So, roughly speaking, the physical length of the LCD has tripled, but the length measured in pixels has only slightly doubled. To be precise, the iPhone has 164.8 pixels per inch diagonal, while the iPad has 131.9, almost 80%. This corresponds to a data spacing of about 20%.
