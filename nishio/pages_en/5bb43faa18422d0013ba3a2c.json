	It is a mystery why more and more people misunderstand that "negotiation" is not a matter of one party following the other's decision, but a process of parties seeking a mutually favorable conclusion by sharing information with each other.
	I wonder if the difference is whether you see "negotiation" as a metaphor for "war" or "fisticuffs" or as a metaphor for "cooperation" or "collaboration."
	The comment, "How does the company calculate the fair market value?", misrepresents the company as calculating and the employee as complying, and the comment, "If someone else offers a higher price, will you accept it?", misrepresents the employee side as offering a price and the company complying. Neither is a negotiation.
 I wonder if it is important to have an environment where "[psychological safety]" is ensured as a basic premise, and where people can say if they have any doubts about their treatment. Some people are afraid that they will be treated unfairly by saying so, but I think a safe atmosphere is created by the "[trust]" that the company has built up over the years by advocating "[responsibility to ask questions]" and answering them with "sincerity. #Trust in the company #Social Relational Capital
	Perhaps like [the coral reef metaphor], we have been steadily building up unobtrusive measures over nearly a decade, and now they are showing their faces a little above the surface of the sea.
 Some people look only at the part above sea level and say, "I understand the ideal, but how can we make it happen, we are not on the ground. However, this is not an "ideal" but a "reality. The reason why it looks like an "ideal" that does not have its feet on the ground is only because that person does not see what is piled up below the sea surface.

	Cybozu today" tends to catch people's attention, but I think what is useful as knowledge is "what Cybozu has done in the past 10 years to get to where it is today. There is a book by the president himself, in which he talks about his own naked failures, as well as a variety of information provided by employees, so you should be able to track a lot just from the public information.
 It's not open to the outside world, but internal discussions and decisions are kept as electronic data on groupware, and it's a much easier subject for management studies.
 While I think it's beneficial to do this, I have other tasks that have higher priority, and it's a "phenomenon of procrastination due to large tasks" to do nothing, so I split up the tasks and write miscellaneous bullet points in Scrapbox [Cybozu's HR system].
