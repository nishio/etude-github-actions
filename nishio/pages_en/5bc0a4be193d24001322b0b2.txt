[nishio.icon]What is Maximum Mean Discrepancy?

Use [LSTM] for G in [GAN] and [TextCNN] for D and E
	What's E? →Encoder

[* Soft-argmax approximation]
	There is some difficulty in handling argmax because it is not differentiable, but I suggest that this could be replaced with softmax.
	[$ W[\arg\max_i x_i] \approx W \mathrm{softmax}(L x_i) ]
	where L is a large scalar, such as 1000, which coincides with argmax in the limit L → ∞.
 The stability of the calculation may need to be taken care of separately. Related [logsumexp].
