	独立公理 (Independence Axlom)
 	FRs are defined as the minimum number of independent requirements that describe the design goals, and FR independence must be maintained at all times
 情報公理 (Information Axlom)
 	The best design is the one with the least amount of information required in a design that satisfies the independence axiom.
		In other words, the design with the highest probability of success is the best design(?).
  情報の定義:
   [https://gyazo.com/40483c4192e30285a36606a3be0e8e2e]
   In other words, the "information" he refers to is a value that is 0 when the probability of success is 1 and ∞ when it is 0

 The mapping from requirements function to design is represented by matrix A.
 	FR = A DP
  Independent design when the matrix is a diagonal matrix, quasi-independent design when the matrix is a triangular matrix, and interference design otherwise.

 Axiom 1 (Independence Axiom): The design matrix must be of independent or quasi-independent design
 Axiom 2 (Information Axiom): The optimal design is the one with the least amount of information among designs that satisfy the independence axiom.
