Thumb shift transition period
　Banning Roman input has reduced the throughput of output via the keyboard.
　　I think it will gradually get faster as I get more proficient at [thumb shift].
　First situation since 20 years ago when we started communicating via chat.
　　I can understand a little how people with slow keyboard typing feel.
　　Makes it difficult to think and write about difficult things.
　　Writing tools must be smooth in order to [think in writing].
　　Flick or handwrite.
　　　This is a flick.
　　Conversely, not having such "writing tools" is a handicap.
　　　If you only have audio [smooth means of output], you can't write and think.
