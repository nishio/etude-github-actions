Don't believe in "can do."
When a personal blog says, "You can do this if you use
　"Oh, so if I use ~, I can do ~!" but this is not right.
	All we can read from this sentence is "this person thinks that if he uses ~, he can do ~".
	Not sure if it was actually done.
	Not even sure if they tried.
	I'd actually try it and when I could do it, I'd write "I did it."
		Attach evidence of completion such as photos, videos, source code, etc.
		There is no point in saying "I could" or "I can" without evidence of having done so.

　Even if "could" is true, it's only "this person was able to use ~ to do ~."
　　Only that it could be done under the conditions that the person tried.
　　No guarantee that it can be done under other conditions.
