Update Text from Script
[https://gyazo.com/ecfc18d06bb92fd64db60ba69102ee49]

code:cs
	GameObject.Find("FooText").GetComponent<Text>().text = x.ToString();
If the text itself has a unique name "FooText".

I tried to cast Text after getting [GameObject] in Find, but that was a mistake.

If the parent object that has the text has a name
code:cs
 GameObject.Find("Foo").GetComponentInChildren<Text>().text = x.ToString();

 Update [Text] from script
 [debugging]
