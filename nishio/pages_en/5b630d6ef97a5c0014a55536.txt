Shuhari

Shuhari is a concept in Japanese arts such as tea ceremony and budo that describes the process of mastering a technique.
The process is expressed in three stages. It is expressed in three stages: "Shu," "Break," and "Release.
It is originally found in "Rikyu Doju," a collection of lessons by Sen no Rikyu.

Mamoru is the stage of faithfully following the kata (form) taught by the master and making sure to master it.

Breaking is the stage in which one examines the techniques of other masters and schools, adopts what is good, and refines one's own techniques. Those who have mastered kata are able to "break" existing kata. By studying the kata of other schools and comparing them with one's own kata, one can find a kata more suited to oneself.

The "weaning" stage is the stage of leaving an existing mold and creating a new one.
A person who is familiar with both the kata taught by his master and the kata he has discovered on his own understands himself well and is not bound by the existing kata. In this way, new kata are born.

[Eugene T. Gendlin] mentions [Martin Heidegger's] concept of [dwell-think] in [Phenomenology as an Illogical Stage].
	>We do not need to surrender what is already formed. When we precisely understand its formed intricacy, that is just when we exceed its forms. When we don't understand a book, we can only quote it. To understand it is to dwell-think in its forms, and that is more precise than the forms.
　[nishio.icon]Translation: we do not have to surrender to "what is already structured. When we understand a complex structure accurately, that is the moment to go beyond that structure. When we read a book and do not understand it, we can only quote it. To understand a book is to dwell-think within its structure, which is a more accurate understanding than the written structure.
　　This is, in the words of the defensive breakaway, "when we 'defend' exactly the complex structure described in a book, that is the 'breakaway' moment."

To [break the frame], you have to see it clearly first.

Interesting slide, Mamoru clarifies the boundaries of "[type]".

The kata is ambiguous at first, and it becomes clearer as one continues to defend it.
Clarity will help you break it intentionally.
