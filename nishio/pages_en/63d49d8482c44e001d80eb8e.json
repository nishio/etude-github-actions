	　1: Write about something you don't know
	　Write a hypothesis about what you don't know
	　What do I not know, what do I need to find out, where might I find the material, etc.?
	　2: Write when you know something new
	　Write when you find out something you don't know.
	　3: Write to explain to others what you know
　I'm not writing about something I already know very well.
　When you try to give someone else an explanation you have written in the past, sometimes a word is used that the person does not know.
	　Word links are empty.
　It's like, "No, I'm going to have to explain this to you."
　Write a minimal description to connect the path.
　I'll copy and paste the description from Wikipedia or something and post the link.
　I don't think I can write about something I know absolutely nothing about.
　All accompanied by intellectual production activities[/villagepump/Haruhi.icon].
　Research, teach others, formulate hypotheses


[research -> summarize -> have someone check it out].
