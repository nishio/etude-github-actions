>I came up with the idea the day before yesterday, but I couldn't find time to write the code, so I finally did it now.
>If the width of the road is 1 and the smallest square is [golden ratio]g, there are only three ways to arrange the squares of size g^n in such a tight manner: g^1, g^3, and g^4. So, I thought of [tiling] to fill the given rectangle with these three types of squares.
>Of course, if there is no other evaluation function, it is possible to fill up the space by lining up squares of the smallest size, etc. Therefore, we decided to use the evaluation function "1 point is deducted when squares of the same size are lined up". The above figure is still in the process of calculation, so a large square is lined up in the upper left corner.
>9x7 would look like this.

>If you paint colors randomly, it looks like this, but it would be better to choose four colors and paint them so that they are not adjacent to each other.

	This one has only one square of the same size instead of zero road thickness.
