Need to get more output to more people to get more feedback

	I rearranged them based on my findings from the last [clean space experiment], and I noticed a few more things.
	I had previously thought that manuscript writing needed to be enhanced by software and methodology, but I had not really thought through why. Only to reduce the burden or something like that. If that is the reason, then it should be okay to stop writing.
	When I think about it in combination with many other things and the reasons for doing it, I realized that fundamentally, I have the feeling that I need to [get more feedback], and to do that I need to [deliver more output to more people].
	Learning English because I feel I will get more feedback if I extend the reach of my output to the English-speaking world.
	I give out [open-ended questionnaires] at lectures because I want to get [feedback].
