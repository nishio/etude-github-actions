	It's also common to use physics to make things unpredictable (e.g. Angry Birds).
 	Using random numbers to make it unpredictable is not interesting, the edge phenomenon of chaos caused by physical operations makes it interesting.
  Predictability, making you think that if you increase X more, you can increase the objective variable more, but if you increase it to some extent, it will not increase due to unexpected interactions.
   It will be a game of improvement through the [PDCA cycle] of experimentation, observation, and correction.


	Cannot put a 3x3 module and a 4x4 module in a 6x6 box
  [Modules and Integral]
  Modularization increases the reusability of the modules themselves, but is counterproductive to global optimization
	If you can acquire the skill, through investment, of "ignoring block overlaps down to one square," you can create a product with a 3x3 module and a 4x4 module in a 6x6 box, something your competitors can't do.
 	Easy to implement but may be too versatile > skills.
  If it's something like "a skill that reduces one corner of a specific 4x4 module," the skill itself becomes obsolete at the same time that 4x4 module becomes [obsolete].
