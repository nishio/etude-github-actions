I'm not sure this is the right project title for me to use when I want to move away from the concept of "motivation," but I haven't come up with a good name for it yet.
ã€€Like pChangeMaker?
ã€€Prompting Action.

ã€€What I've learned from organizing so far
ã€€The "improvements" are being torn in two directions.
ã€€ã€€Route to be put on the current chat system.
ã€€ã€€A route I'm thinking of that can't be done by putting it on the chat system.
ã€€ã€€ã€€Retention of per-user information is not possible with the current implementation of the chat system, which forgets information for each conversation.
ã€€ã€€ã€€Not a conversation, but an attempt to gather information about physical activity, not chatty.
 There are three levels.
 ã€€There are some suggestions for improvements that can be made without changing the current system of options.
 ã€€There are things that can't be done with the current choice formula, but can be done with a chat system that does natural language processing.
 ã€€Something the current chat system can't do.

ã€€This looks like a good idea to move the whole thing to Kozaneba.
ã€€I'll just do the motivation system part first.



 [I would like to think about a non-chat form of Keichobot.]
 [Good luck developing thoughts on the relationship between motivational systems and Keichobot.]
