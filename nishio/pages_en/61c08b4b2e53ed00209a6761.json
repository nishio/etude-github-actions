	A byproduct of the experiment of using Kozaneba to "assist in chewing up and understanding difficult texts" ([Kozaneba: The Formation of Chinese Hua Yan through the Fusion of the Hua Yan Sutra and Zhuangzi]).

		The ultimate goal of Buddhism is union with "eternal, infinite, and absolute existence" through the practice of meditation, thereby transcending the world of birth and death.
  　This "eternal, infinite, and absolute existence" is called the Dharma, the Way, the Emptiness, the Truth, the "True Truth," the "middle way of non-existence," the "Birshana Buddha in the Lotus World," and so on.

　　　　Dushun divided the world of enlightenment into three stages, but Cheng Kuan added the world of lostness, "the world of the Dharma Realm," to the three stages.
　　　　 This "thing" is an individual thing.
　　　　The world in which all individuals are enlightened that they do not have fixed entities is the "world of reason and law.
　　　　　This "reason" is "eternal, infinite, and absolute existence."
　　　　The individual is the manifestation of a branch of reason, and reason becomes matter, and matter becomes reason.
　　　　　The Hannya Sutra is famous for "color equals emptiness and emptiness equals color" (color = matter, emptiness = reason).
　　　　　This enlightened world is the "Director Unobstructed Dharma Realm."
　　　　　　Hindrance" is the correct character for "hinder" in the Japanese word for obstacle, meaning "to hinder" or "to hinder.
　　　　Based on the above enlightenment, he came back to the world of "things" and realized that "all individual things are also mutually shifting entities.

		Note that at the time of the "Director's unhindered Dharma world," all individual "things" include the "self" as well.
		　If the self as subject and the world as object are opposed to each other, the self as an individual and "reason" cannot be united.
