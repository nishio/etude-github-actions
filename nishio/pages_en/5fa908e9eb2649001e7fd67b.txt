 10^5 range, cost
　Official Explanation
　　To a problem that is partially covered by an interval, add an interval that does not affect the result and make it a problem that covers all of it.
　　　Similar to a shortest path problem with multiple starts and goals, adding an edge with cost 0 to make one start or [goal].
　　[Cost minimization covered by section -> Dijkstra].
