>UCS contains over 100,000 code positions for private use. This means that these code locations may be assigned characters with unique characteristics by individuals, organizations, and software vendors outside the ISO and Unicode Consortium. The Private Use Area (PUA) is one of the areas reserved for private use; the Unicode Standard does not specify any characters in this range.
