exploit one's enemy
lxxxiv 

This is especially true of the rule concerning the deeds of enemies. The wise man gains more from his enemies than the fool gains from his friends. The malice of enemies often builds up mountains of difficulties that they would not otherwise face. Many have had their greatness built up by their enemies. [Flattery is more dangerous than hatred. For flattery covers the dirt that the other tries to wipe away. The wise man turns malice into a mirror more faithful than kindness, removing and improving its faults. Attention grows well when rivalry and malice are next to each other.
