　There are a lot of little [hurdles] in [the project].
　No matter how many hurdles appear, you must be able to jump over them and move on without being discouraged.
　Q: How can this power be acquired?
　　A: To gain experience in seeing [the view beyond
　　　Realize that the benefits you gain after getting out are greater than the cost of jumping over the hurdles

　Are more educated people more likely to be discouraged?
　　Why is that?
　　Strong psychological resistance to being exposed as unwise.
　　　Avoiding actions that could fail.
　　　　Is it not a failure to be discouraged?
　　They look down on muddy work.
　　　Unconsciously looking down on people who do muddy work, and therefore feel kegels about doing that work themselves
　　　Think of muddy work as silly.
　　Giving up seems wise.
　　　Giving up is easy.
　　　We think it's smarter to act like that than to muddle through and say something like, "We decided we don't like this policy for a reason."
