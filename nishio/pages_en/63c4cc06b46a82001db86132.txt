The above explanation of the "five-minute break" is a mysterious [ritual][/villagepump/nishio.icon] that occurred in the process of popularizing the Pomodoro Technique.
　It's explicitly denied in the 2010 [Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique].
　　I went into it in 2012 saying that it was spreading the wrong interpretation, but it just keeps spreading.
 　[Pomodoro Technique: Length of Break] (2012-11-11)
 　>To quote from "Length of breaks" on p. 152.
    >>Should breaks be [timeboxed] as well? Will it prevent a long, unscheduled break? The answer is no. Because you have to be mentally ready when you start your next pomodoro.
　I had read about it and completely forgot about it[/villagepump/miyamonz.icon].
　I'd forget about it, and I'd want to take a break, so I'd usually rest for more than five minutes.
　I thought it wasn't good that I rested slack after just five minutes, but I guess it was natural[/villagepump/yosider.icon].
　　The author, Francesco Sirillo, says that his own experience was just right for him to work for 25 minutes and take a 5-minute break [/villagepump/suto3.icon].
　　　I'm sure you all can find just the right allocation for yourselves, like
　　　[oversimplification], or did some important information fall out in the process of summarizing?
　　　And the Pomodoro part should have said, "Try it yourself and find out if 25 minutes is good for you," and yet, "It's a rule that we do 25 minutes!" It's like [ritualization] [nishio.icon].

Parable[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　Saying "I have a hard time concentrating on my work" to someone who has a hard time concentrating on his work is like saying "I need to work for 25 minutes and take a 5-minute break" to someone who has no muscle strength and wants to improve it is like saying "I need to squat 25 times and do 5 pull-ups" to someone who has no muscle strength and wants to improve it.
　　That's absurd...
　　You wouldn't feel at ease if you turned the timer on during your break.
　>because by the time you start the next pomodoro, you must be mentally ready.
　 This means, "Rest until you feel ready for the next 25 squats."
　He also says, "Let's first measure how many pomodoros I can do in a day."
　　This is because the length of the break can be extended or interrupted and the pomodoro interrupted.
　　You're not observing reality well enough to assume you can do a mechanical process like "25 minutes activity, 5 minutes break."
　　It may be similar to how [hoax spreading] works [/villagepump/suto3.icon].
　　 Simple, easy-to-understand information tends to spread easily, even if it is wrong.
