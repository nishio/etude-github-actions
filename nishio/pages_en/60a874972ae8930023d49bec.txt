>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403681977706840064]: it's ok, as a result of the innovation of holding the event asynchronously, you can still see everyone's presentations and ask questions. We just missed the live demos and synchronous questioning.

>[ukkaripon https://twitter.com/ukkaripon/status/1403683186228416514]: there will be another one tomorrow!

>[73_ch https://twitter.com/73_ch/status/1403683633047633922]: my laziness is getting in the way of the type of video I can watch anytime I want, but I'll try my best!

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403683850111180810]: don't watch the video, just watch the questions.

>[73_ch https://twitter.com/73_ch/status/1403685330159505411]: well, that's clever!

>[73_ch https://twitter.com/73_ch/status/1403911797988487173]: now that it is held asynchronously (video), it is friendly to lazy people who can watch it at twice the speed
