Expert advice and layman's opinion
There is value in the advice of the expert and the amateur, and conversely, there is no value in the expert's opinion and the amateur's advice.
	The [amateur's] [advice] is a [paraphrase] of someone else's opinion.
		I haven't gone through the process of actually doing it myself [verification].
	The [impressions] of [experts] are often at odds with the [majority's] impressions.
		The majority of the world is amateur.

>You really should listen to "[professional advice]" and "[layperson's opinion]," and what you should not listen to the most is "[professional opinion]" and "[layperson's advice]," so you don't have to follow deeply even if someone who knows the industry says, "Wow," or you don't have to listen to someone who says "You should do this" about something you haven't experienced. You don't need to listen to someone who says "I've never done this before, but it's better this way.
	[In advice and feedback, the difference between what you should really listen to and what you shouldn't listen to is very familiar "I feel it in my body" - Togetter https://togetter.com/li/1276935]
