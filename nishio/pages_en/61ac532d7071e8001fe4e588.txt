	Experiencing and the Creation of Meaning: A Philosophical and Psychological Approach to the Subjective
	[Eugene T. Gendlin]
	[Amazon https://amzn.to/3oqUsAU]

I bought it to check the original text of [Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning], but I didn't realize until after I bought it that the subtitle was "Approach to the Subjective".
