Non-publicly accessible URLs do not infringe the right to make transmittable
In the discussion of [private links], someone questioned whether a situation where "an accessible URL exists but is not publicly available" constitutes an infringement of the [right to make it transmittable].

Article 2 of the [Copyright Act] states that making transmittable means making it available for automatic public transmission.
>Making available for automatic public transmission by any of the following acts: (i) making available for automatic public transmission....
It says that automatic public transmission is the automatic transmission of public information in response to a request from the public.
>9-4 [Automatic public transmission] Any public transmission that is made automatically in response to a request from the public (excluding ... (excluding the following). means a transmission that is made automatically in response to a request from the public (excluding ...).
Public transmission is written ~ for the purpose of being directly received by [the public].
>...] for the purpose of being directly received by the public....

A condition where the accessible URL is not published is clearly not "intended to be received directly by the public."

If this URL is inadvertently and negligently disclosed, it is not a crime under the Penal Code because of the principle in Article 38 of the Penal Code that "acts without intent to commit a crime shall not be punished. As for the damage caused by the leakage, Article 709 of the Civil Code states "intentionally or negligently," so even if the leakage was negligent, the owner is liable for damages under the Civil Code. see [Damages in tort].
