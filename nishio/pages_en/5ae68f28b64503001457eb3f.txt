The law of increasing marginal cost does not fit the reality.
 [Law of increasing marginal cost: The more you make, the higher the cost of production.
 	This is the opposite of [economies of scale].
  Even as a practical matter, [marginal cost] goes down with mass production.
  So I looked it up and found some discussion about it.
  The right-shifting [supply curve] focuses only on the mass-production portion of the U-shaped [average cost curve] below.

   	The average cost curve is the slope of the line connecting each point of the total cost curve to the origin.

		As for new manufacturing from 0 to 1, the supply curve is falling right

		If the supply curve exceeds the demand curve, the supplier "is in the red" and the demander "is too expensive".
  If this is reversed, the supplier "is in the black" and the demander "wants it!" and the demander says, "I want it!
