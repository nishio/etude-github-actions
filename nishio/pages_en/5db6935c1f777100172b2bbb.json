Do not make every occurrence of a keyword a link
	It is not a good idea to [link] all the places where [keyword] [appears].
		That's the same result as if you [searched] for that keyword on the search page.
	[There is an optimum between the two extremes].
	 One extreme, "the keywords are not links at all."
	 At the other extreme, "every occurrence of the keyword is a link."
