The fallacy of "everyone is happy when stock prices go up."
	Stock prices that rise faster than the increase in corporate value will eventually fall again.
 	[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/仕手 仕手]
  	By bombarding a stock with a large number of buy orders in a short period of time with a small number of shares in circulation, the normal sell orders can be temporarily depleted and the price of the stock can be increased significantly.
   By doing this, they will get on the rising rate rankings, etc., and attract attention.
   The fact that the price has gone up will cause people to falsely believe that the price will continue to go up (the principle of bubble generation).
   Those who had purchased at a lower price in advance, profit by selling during this period of temporarily rising prices.
   Those who bought during the period will have unrealized losses for a long time after the stock price returns to its original level

 Only those who sell during that period will profit from a short-term rise.
	 There is no gain or loss for those who hold on to it for the duration.
  When a transaction is executed, there are both sellers and buyers. Those who buy during that period lose money when the price drops later.
 		Employee stock ownership plans often have a "buy a certain amount every month" investment policy to avoid insider suspicion
			Those who mistakenly bought the tickets when they went up, but at their own risk, will have a loss.
   	In some cases, this dissatisfaction is not taken out on the side of "anonymous stockbrokers who have profited by driving up the stock price," but on the side of "companies whose names are known to be annoyed by the shaking up of the stock price.
