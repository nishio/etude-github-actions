 NISHIO Please leave your bits...REPLACE is a pain in the ass!
 nanki 初めて見る命令だ
 Nishio If REPLACE is used on the second page or something like that, it makes it pointless to read it as hard as I tried.
 nanki 確かに!
 Nanki can't pick and choose...
 nanki じゃあ、replaceで
 Nishio Then WORM.
 nanki wormきた
 The two seas are growing in abundance.
 nanki こええ
 nanki floaterでw floaterを極める!
 Nishio 09: BIT_MOVER
 Nanki It seems to me that even if only one nanki card is used extremely, it will not make any sense at all.
 Nishio FLOATER quite interesting
 nanki 14:power_surge
 Nishio 06: REMOVE_CARD
 The nanki worm is too scary, but I'm willing to REPLACE it just to see it work.
 Nishio You can't just move it once and kill it the next time (oh).
 NANKI It could be too late w
 Nishio That's interesting w
 nanki 12:future
 Nishio 08: REVERSE_PROGRAM
 nanki GOTOで！
 NISHIO 01: In ACQUIRE
 nanki increment
 Nishio 11: Maybe ACQUIRE.

 NISHIO REPLACE?(y/n)
 nanki y. replace 06。 なにが起こるか…
 Nishio, what, are you 06, you mean you can't bear to kill WORM out of the blue?
 nanki You mean not worm? I guess I'll go with worm...
 Nishio, I've already drawn.
 nanki OK
 Nishio UPGRADE
 nanki What's that...

 nanki カオスw
 Nisio, you're in trouble.
 It was a more interesting development than REPLACE NANKI WORM. Just can't control it><
 Nishio Hmmm, adding bits to BIT_MOVER in WORM
 nanki bit_moverで能力を剥奪されるのが怖い。08:reverse_programにbit追加
 Nishio: He did the worst thing he could do to me.
 Nishio I don't reverse.
 In nanki, invoke reverse, worm nishio-san
 NISHIO Add bits to FLOATER w
 nanki ちょwww
 Nishio Terra Chaos W
 nanki wormやばいw
 NISHIO: As expected of a worm, if you don't get rid of it while it's still one, it's going to get more and more chaotic.

 nanki bit_moverこわい
 Nishio REPLACE is still alive, it would be sad to see it replaced by GOTO.
 nanki w
 Nishio So, here's Nanki's worm.
 nanki power_surgeにbitを追加
 Nishio And floater
 nanki floaterやばいなw 上に移動しよう
 Move between nanki 03, 05 and copy INCREMENT
 nanki How many more... it's definitely not a floater.
 Nishio Chaos W
 nanki power_surge++!
 Nishio Gee, 4 damage! Dangerous. But thanks to moving the floater up, I can skip REPLACE. w Move two up, acquire, then more acquire. 10:16
 nanki 回復力すごいw
 Nishio power_surge will reduce it quickly w 2 shots of 1:4 damage. 8:8. lined up w
 nanki future!
 Nisio 10:8 and then you jump to UPGRADE.
 nanki upgradeきた
 Nishio It's random, so it's hard to know where to put it.
 Draw during Nishio 03:05! drawn card is: GOTO...don't need it.
 nanki incrementか。replaceをinrement
 Nishio Wow. You continue to REPLACE.
 nanki 13と03をreplace

 Nishio What a luck to change the card with your bit on it to a bit_mover, of all things!
 nanki わお
 Nishio And it's a floater.
 nanki floaterを上に動かしてself_destruct
 Nishio That floater will explode. Are you sure?
 nanki ok. floaterは危険w 十分遊んだ
 NISHIO Self-destructs 10:4 and FUTURE
 nanki future使う 12:4
 Jump to UPGRADE at Nishio. It's tough. I mean, it's dead. Draw between 11 and 12 at upgrade, just in case.
 nanki Oh, goto detached
 Nishio I should have detached it earlier. I'm screwed.

 Then, POWER_SURGE was the final straw.
 
 *1238430306* too much sleep
 - Around 7:00 p.m. I get sleepy.
 - If I go to bed now, I'll wake up in the middle of the night, but I'll be too sleepy to get anything done."
 - "Okay, I'll sleep for 15 minutes!"
 - Fifteen minutes.
 - Fifteen minutes.
 - Huh? Is the date changed?
 
 The body doesn't get much slumber, only the sleep counter resets and I can't sleep, and the time is midnight. Hmmm. Maybe I should have stayed up and had a cup of coffee.
