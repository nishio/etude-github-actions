Kings and Clowns
	The [king] who has dictatorial power is aware of the danger that his power will prevent "information inconvenient to him" from being communicated.
 Inconvenient information is very important when change occurs
 But if you push for efficiency in maintaining normalcy, you end up with a [hierarchical organization].
 Hierarchical organization does not properly communicate inconvenient information
 Requires an irregular presence that does not belong to a hierarchical organization
 That's where [clowning] is needed.
 Clowns are not part of a hierarchical organization.
	A clown is not punished for giving the king an earful.
 Clowns can criticize the nobility.

	But how does a clown get to know the king?
 A clown can't suddenly meet the king.
 In other words, the clown must first be liked by the nobility and intercede with the king.
 If you gain the king's trust and create a state of shelter, you may strike a nobleman.
 These two phases are separate.
