If it's a good idea, don't ask permission.
A quote from [Grace Hopper], who developed the programming language COBOL.
In Japan, it is known by phrases such as "[Don't ask for permission, beg for forgiveness].
There are variants.
>It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.
>Variant: If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it. It is much easier to apologize than it is to get permission.

I think the variant is more complementary to the words and conveys the meaning better.
　Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.
　If it's a good idea, do it without asking permission."

	When I come up with a good idea, I try it first.
  It's not a good idea to wait for [permission] in advance.
  	We don't know in advance if we will be successful, only [after the fact].
  See [Result] and [Correct].
  	If you try it and it doesn't work, apologize then.

>[Don't ask permission. Apologize."]

 Another expression of the same material [apology rather than asking for permission].
	[all is well]

	Short Expression
		[Apology rather than permission.]
		[Don't ask permission.]

Many people find the word "[apology]" heavy-handed. That would be contrary to the intent.
The important part is the "[do it without asking for permission]" part.
