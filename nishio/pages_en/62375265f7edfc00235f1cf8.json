I heard there's a [edit war] going on at Dominion Wiki between people who write "This card is the best!" and there seems to be an [editing war] going on between those who write "This card is the best!
　It's a hassle to deal with people like that, so I knew I couldn't [operate without closing the door].
　[/villagepump/security operations that do not lock rooms].
　　It was [an operation not to lock the door].


[I'm playing Dominion in a Factorio way.]

The last one I made is useful, but it's a pain to get the supply data in.
　At least I should be able to edit it on screen because it's a pain to fix and build.

It would be nice to be able to play Dominion while walking if you could limit the cards and play against a strong AI on your phone, but I don't know if anyone is making that.
　Level 1: Treasure and victory point cards only
　Level 2: + Blacksmith
　Level 3: +Village

This supply I lost yesterday in an in-person match.

　Hard Fought the AI several times.
　First hand, Minister, Ducato gold coin
　　The public minister as a terminal 4-card draw.
　　Ducato gold coins as + purchase
　Hunting party for 5 coins
　　One "card I don't have" will come, so I can draw a high probability of a public minister.
　I'll buy a bard and a legate.
　　The bard is a village, and incidentally discards all but the top three action cards in the deck, increasing the odds of drawing action with the hunting party and the bard.
　　3 coins to make Dukat gold coins instead of buying silver coins. To not increase the variety of cards.
　If I can pull it off, I'll buy a gold coin.
　　If you haven't pulled it off and it's 8 coins or so, buy a bard and a legate.
 　No need to rush to buy a genus state.
　　　The fewer card types in the deck, the better to draw off.

packed dominion
　Guards in throne renovations, artisans, artisans in gentry, draws in guards.
　Two throne renovations and four craftsmen to the province.
　Renovations to make craftsmen a gentry, strategists a gazetted territory, and vaults a gazetted territory.
　Game set with 42 points including 6 cards of the genus state this turn.

　I don't know what kind of deck it was when you make these last minute plays that destroy the deck.

I hope you can look at a card and decide if it's for stero or combo.
　But this "combo" is a vague concept.
　For example, vassals obviously "prefer a higher ratio of action in the deck."
　The throne room must also coincide with other actions
　　But this is the throne room and terminal action, and I'm not happy to be at 100%.
　　　Since only one pair can be used.
　Cards that earn gold or silver coins would be suitable for Stero.
　Compression cards are advantageous for both, but especially for Engine
　Cantrip money is Engine oriented
　　Even a stero can be useful, but if you buy a silver coin at 3 cost, it's +2, but if you buy a merchant, it's equivalent to a silver coin "when you play and draw a copper coin and have a silver coin in your hand," so it only shows its value when your deck is full of silver coins.
　　　Rough calculations suggest that the break-even point is about 50% of the deck in silver coins?
　　Should it be combined with Silver Gainer?
