Don't be afraid to try the solutions you come up with.
>After working as a TA for programming exercises for about two years, I have found that the people who are growing are those who are not afraid to implement the ideas they come up with and are able to put them into practice. Those who are afraid are probably too accustomed to the one-question-and-one-answer approach in their education, and are under the mistaken impression that there is only one answer to their questions. I wish people would think more freely.
>I've had a few people ask me, "I want to do XXX, is it OK to introduce new variables? I have received such questions from several people, but I think you should be free to define variables and functions and implement what you want to do without so much fear!
