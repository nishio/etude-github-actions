When you mix lies with words, you diverge more and more from your true self.
If you mix lies when you put thoughts into words, when words become thoughts, lies will be mixed in and you will diverge more and more from your true self.

	This one stuck [takker.icon].
	I thought, "If you mix lies when you put thoughts into words, when words become thoughts, lies will be mixed in and you will diverge more and more from your true self."[nishio.icon].
	 The incentive to mix that lie with a desire for approval, such as "I want to look good.
	ã€€When you get notified when someone likes or retweets something on Twitter, etc., you "see" that text over and over again.
	 When you tweet your morning self for temporary approval and it is inadvertently accepted and liked, you are shown over and over again that "this is who you are, and people around you like it," and I think that would cause you to diverge from your true self.
