This is interesting!

It is more like "historical fiction" in the sense of "writing about a possible fictional history.
 
 When I was a student, I didn't like history that much, but I think that was because I mostly memorized each theory. After playing Civilization, I started to find history interesting from the perspective of fictional history and the interaction between nations. Asimov seems to be an expert not only in science but also in meta-history.
