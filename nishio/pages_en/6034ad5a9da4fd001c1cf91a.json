Pomodoro Timer Video
I think the idea of "playing a YouTube video of Pomodoro on TV" is a good way to share my Pomodoro state with my wife.
　Past Drafts
 　Timer app at hand
 　　My wife has to peek in to see the condition.
 　　You can't tell if the screen is asleep or open to something else when you peek at it.
 　How to talk to Siri to "timer for 25 minutes
 　　I can see why they started Pomodoro.
 　　I don't know if I can talk to my wife when I'm done or if it's still going on because she notices the end on the vibration of the Apple watch and stops it.
　With video, you can see what's going on on the screen.
　　Various with and without background music.
　　I prefer videos with silent background music and only sound at the start and end.
　　　If you want to play background music, you can choose whatever you want.
　If the background color indicates whether you're working or resting, you can tell from a distance.
　I'm playing it on my Apple TV, so my side can control it with my iPhone and it doesn't eat up resources on my PC or phone.
