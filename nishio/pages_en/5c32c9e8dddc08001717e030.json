Is an electronic declaration of intent a written document?
A gift that is not in writing can be revoked. If a gift is made electronically, is it a written statement of intent? The argument that
> (Gift)
>Article 549 A gift shall become effective when one party indicates an intention to give his/her property to the other party without consideration and the other party accepts the gift.
> (Withdrawal of a gift not in writing)
>Article 550 A gift not in writing may be withdrawn by each party. However, this shall not apply to the part of the gift for which performance has been completed.

In this regard, the lawyer [Twitter @atsuokshr0925 https://twitter.com/atsuokshr0925/status/1081822184673140736] argues that
>Under the Civil Code, there is a provision that even in the case of an electromagnetic record, it is deemed to have been made in writing (Civil Code Article 446, Paragraph 3), but since there is no such provision regarding gift contracts, I think it should be said that they are not "in writing.

My gut reaction was, "Isn't the question of whether it's in writing or not about whether or not there will be evidence?" I was surprised, though,
This interpretation makes sense because jurists generally read the rule as the opposite if a special rule is stipulated.
