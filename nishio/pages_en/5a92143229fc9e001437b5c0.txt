 I think it would be better to send out messages in [English], but it's a task with no deadline, so it's hard to get started.
 How about writing casually in Scrapbox, automatically machine translating it, transcribing it to the English version of the Scrapbox project, and then tweeting it out on an English account so that I get notified when there are reactions [social triggers]?
