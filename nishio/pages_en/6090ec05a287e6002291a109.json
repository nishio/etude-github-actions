  I wonder if the authors of the languages that use black magic to make it easier to create DSLs would consider making it impossible to use black magic unless you use BlackMagic; at the beginning of the file, or making it explicit what magic is being used by having the author write use BlackMagic::MetaClassHack; or something like that. Hey.

 Python's PEP 20 states that "Explicit is better than implicit," and "Design and Evolution of C++," p. 284, states that "The desire for flexibility and freedom of expression clashes with the desire for safety, predictability, and simplicity. In fact, Option Explicit and use Explicit and use Explicit and use Explicit are not only the same thing. In fact, there have been cases where "options to harden a language that has been made too soft" such as Option Explicit and use strict have been introduced.
 
 Shouldn't we avoid language design that emphasizes flexibility already?

 What the speaker can understand is "cool hacks that make good use of language features" and what he cannot is "black magic". A powerful sorcery of prehistoric times is "LISP macros," but it is hardly widespread. The more powerful the magic is, the fewer people understand it, and the more it is abhorred as black magic.
