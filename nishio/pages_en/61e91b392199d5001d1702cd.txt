(4.4.3.1) Definition of understanding
The definition of '[understand]' by mathematicians is quite different from how we use the word in everyday conversation.

If you "understand" a concept, you need to be able to answer the question of why the concept is correct. "It is written in the book" is not a proper answer. You need to explain it in [your own words]. If the book uses a theorem or definition that you do not know, you must investigate it. 

[Yasuyuki Kawahigashi] prohibits to see notes at the seminar. He defines "understand" as the state which you can explain the concept with your own words without seeing anything.
