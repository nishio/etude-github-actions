 *1339079206*Diary of trying Rackhub
 I tried <a href='http://rackhub.net/overview'>Rackhub: a localhost in the cloud for you, a fully configured development server ready to use in 10 seconds</a>. I got to the point where I could start the service on port 80 in 33 minutes, with a lot of stumbling. I'll get to the blogging part in the remaining 17 minutes.
 
 Here is the thing: <a href='http://sphinxweb.rackbox.net/'>sphinxweb</a> username and password are guest:guest and admin:admin, respectively. Sphinx WebSupport and Flask, a Python framework. Source code is here. <a href='https://github.com/nishio/sphinxweb/tree/temp_rackhub'>nishio/sphinxweb at temp_rackhub</a>
 
 I decided to work while measuring time, so I started the timer and started by searching Rackhub, and in <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">40 seconds</span> I have an account and even have a picture of my face. So the mug shot was pulled from that service (forgot the name).
 
 Start <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">3 minutes</span> to complete public key registration.
 
 I registered my credit card and started <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">Rack in 5 minutes</span>. I tried to connect via ssh right away, but was disappointed to find that the DNS had not been updated yet. I thought I would just wait and enter by specifying the IP address, but I couldn't find where the IP address was written...oh well...and then <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">7 minutes</span> later, I was able to enter. I was able to get in in <span class="deco">7 minutes</span>.
 
 I git clone the desired repository for now. git was in there, but when I tried to edit it, it didn't have emacs. I try to edit it, but it doesn't have emacs, or screen, or anything. Start here <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">11 minutes</span>.
 
 pip is not included. Do $ easy_install pip and then do $ pip install -r requirements.txt for your service. You have to install quite a lot of things.
 
 Start <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">16 minutes</span>, he mumbles, "The server is up on port 5000, but 80 is good. But right after that, "I sudoed to use port 80, but the path changed and I can't find flask anymore..." orz
 
 I tried setting the non-sudo python sys.path to the sudo python sys.path and it says there is no pysqlite2 (ImportError: No module named pysqlite2). After $ pip install pysqlite, the error message changed to pysqlite2/_sqlite.so: undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS2_AsUTF8String www. Start here <span class="deco" style="" font-weight:bold;">24 minutes</span>.
 
 I googled the error message and found a description of the --with-unicode=ucs[24] mismatch as the cause. I was wondering how I could find out what the --with-unicode=ucs[24] option is when Rackhub builds Python... Oh, it seems it's been <span class="deco" style="font-weight: bold;">25 minutes</span> since the start. bold;">25 minutes</span> since it started." I mumble to myself. Too bad 1 Pomodoro couldn't do it.
 
 Another Pomodoro begins.
 
 Start <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">29 minutes</span> "Okay, sudo python and python point to different Python binaries, so the --with-unicode=ucs[24 ] must be different."
 
 >||
 $ which python
 /home/rackhuber/.pythonbrew/pythons/Python-2.7.3/bin/python
 $ sudo which python
 /usr/bin/python
 ||<
 
 So that's what you're doing. So instead of doing sudo python, I do sudo /home/rackhuber/.pythonbrew/pythons/Python-2.7.3/bin/python.
 
 Start <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">30 minutes</span>"Server started and I was able to access it on 80! But I forgot to build the data for the display w"
 
 Start <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">33 minutes</span>"Okay, done, 33 minutes."
 
 Okay, just 50 minutes, 2 pomodoros and I was able to try Rackhub and get to blogging!
