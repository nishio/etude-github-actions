First impressions of U Theory
[2014-04-10 https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10203037651078743]
I've been skimming through the >[U Theory] book and it's pretty interesting.
> I was convinced of the PDCA cycle, but that was because the cycle was already turning, and if you try to get someone who is not turning to do it, they stop at "So, how do you make a [plan]? If you try to do it with people who are not already in the cycle, they stop at "So, how do you make a [plan]?" or they make a detailed plan without being aware of the possibility that they lack knowledge about the problem, which later falls apart.
> Whether it's the hypothesis-experiment-test-revise cycle or the trendy Lean Startup, when you actually try to do it, the question arises, "So, how do you find [the hypothesis]?
> I have been saying "[first observation]" for problems that are stumbling before entering this kind of "cycle," but Yoo Theory divides this part into seven stages.
> The first is the stage of looking at things according to preconceived notions, in other words, "you can't see.
> Next there is the "looking" phase, followed by the "looking closely" phase. So far, it looks like a breakdown of "observing first".
> The next stage is the bottom of the U-shape, and to enter this stage, you have to let go of your preconceived notions once. A state of identification with the problem without any judgment, such as [flow state] of [Csikszentmihalyi] or [pure experience] of [Nishida Ikitaro].
> The [experience] gathered thereby [crystallizes] in the next stage, and a new, non-existing concept is created.
> The next step is [prototyping] based on that new understanding, and the next step is [practice].
> I would say that the book is dedicated to the first D of the PDCA cycle, how to take the first step without yet having the material knowledge for the P.

I wrote this later.
