Scrapbox and IR/IW
I was wondering how to realize [Incremental Reading] in [Scrapbox], but I thought that we could have [Slack] notify us of updates and have a bot on Slack watch them and notify us in a week or so. You could do something like "[What happened a year ago]" on [Facebook].

[Incremental Writing] re-posts fragments previously written in [Spaced Repetition], but Scrapbox does it with links. It is necessary to control this.
