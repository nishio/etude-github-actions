Duplicate here what I wrote on the well
I think it would be better to duplicate what you wrote on the well ([/villagepump]) here
　Various ways to connect multiple projects are being explored, but they are not officially supported.
　I hope it's easy to do.

I wonder if what you write on the date page is the equivalent of a "thought node" for this project here.
　There may also be a "development diary" equivalent in the mix.
　Like this [well 2022-01-17].
　　Don't break the icon.
　　Would it be nice to have a user script that inserts and copies the project name into the icon notation?
