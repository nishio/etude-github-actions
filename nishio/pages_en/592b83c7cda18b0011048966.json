What is "weak philosophy?"
I was talking to someone and noticed a discrepancy in the meaning of the term "strong/weak philosophy," so I made a note of it.

For me, "philosophy" means "to question assumptions. What I think is right may not be right for the other person. To begin with, the definition of "correctness" has been proposed more than once in the history of philosophy, and it is known that it cannot be narrowed down to any one definition.

My opponent said "he has a strong philosophy" referring to the fact that a certain person has his own criteria for judgment, but I, on the contrary, felt that he has a weak philosophy. Having one's own standards of judgment is not bad, but he interprets those who make judgments that do not conform to his standards of judgment as "those who make incorrect judgments. This is a failure to understand that "one's standards of judgment are only relative.

This assertion is also a judgment based on "my standard of judgment," and it would boomerang if I say that the assertion of an opponent whose philosophy I consider "weak" is "not correct. Since I take the position that "what is useful to me is correct," I think that it is unhelpful for me to judge the assertion of someone whose philosophy is weak as correct or incorrect, and therefore, I should not judge it. He may say things that are useful to me, or he may say things that are useless. I only need to take in what is beneficial, and it is not important whether he holds the same view of truth as I do or not.
