	I feel like I'm pushing the average up a lot by myself. w

Save slowly, not reflexively.
	Then stir.
	A place to store thoughts
	Reflexive statements and specifications at a meeting can produce a bad product.

Search and create become one.
	Not searchable on the blog.

			I can quickly come up with what I've written in the past and make connections.
	Google's search engine can do searches because it has links to

  Thought patterns that make it easy to search
  	More search paths

Both "spaceships" and "ush" for icons are verbalized.
	Someone has to anticipate and verbalize it in advance to get a hit.

Supporting Study Groups
	It would be nice if the study itself could be accelerated with Scrapbox, but how can it be done?

	He thinks it's a good idea to use the products he makes himself.
	I want to streamline information sharing for my team.
		Agile team of 8~10 people
		Because of the characteristics of a flow-type wiki that allows simultaneous editing
	As the number of people increases, the amount of time and tacit knowledge for information sharing increases.
		Languages take time to develop.
			It's a "ask that guy and he'll tell you" kind of phenomenon.
	Time cost of information sharing needs to be lowered.

I'm curious about this water surface diagram.
	Not on Scrapbox

Facilitator speaks alone.
	I don't see the point of a facilitator.
Unlike chat, multiple topics can be output simultaneously, so there is no blocking problem.

There was a lot of chatter on Slack.
	however, the problem that flows

Scrapbox is collective knowledge, esa is people-driven
	Focus on who is thinking what
		Occurrence of Authority
	Scrapbox, on the contrary, tries to hide whose opinion it is.

It's fun to get comments, so let them watch for 3 minutes and get comments.

Viewpoints and perspectives

Four lines of projects are running in parallel.
	I had created a Scrapbox project for each project.
		They created similar pages and reported similar bugs.
		It's not right to divide them into projects, it's better to have them all in one.
			I can export to JSON and import, but if the title is the same, it will be overwritten.
			Automatic title conversion.
		It's cheaper to combine them into one unit because you're charged per project!

I used to use Pukiwiki -> Google Sites -> Scrapbox

Not just for projects.

Easy to copy pages including images
	It's on Gyazo.
	I guess Pukiwiki's system of attaching to pages was bad.
	Good effect is that the image reverts to notation when copied.

How does it work with GyazoTeams?
	I don't know, I've never used it.

Taking meeting minutes in Scrapbox is great!
	Taking minutes alone is exhausting.
	Multiple people can help each other if they're co-editing.

Slides are converted into PDFs and then into images and put up one by one.

It looks like I can put up an mp4.

I want to use it offline.

Need to share with people outside the company
	I'm printing it out and sharing it as a PDF.
	Create a new project and copy and paste only the pages you need, no more than 100 pages.

In a hierarchical wiki, there's a "don't build in this place" or something like that.
	I don't have to worry about it before "creating a page" because Scrapbox doesn't have it.
		I would venture to say the title.
	Others can tag and give them to you later.

--- Panel Discussion"
[/scrapbox-square/Scrapbox SQUARE #2 Panel Discussion].

 	How much do you tag past minutes? Or is it mainly search? [nishio.icon].
 		→One (Mr. Koga)
 		southern acid
	 		Post images as much as possible because text alone is not interesting.
 			I'll put the slides up first.
 	Derailment during a meeting
 		Remote work: At first I was sending video, but once I got used to it, Scrapbox was enough.
 		Facilitators are not decision makers.
 			You can comment wherever you like, and make it a rule to do so.
 			Facilitators can be ignored.
			Many meetings have slides prepared ahead of time.
			Not much use for Brest.
		Commonalities in various sites?
			Nota is the most extreme, with half and half of the teams in Kanto and Kansai.
			Scrapbox would shorten the meeting itself.
				→If the density in time increases, if the meeting itself disappears, various
					Quality is improving, shortening is not attractive.
				Since it will be done only on Scrapbox
					Discussions on Scrapbox are easier to read and understand than regular meeting minutes.
		Icons show empathy.
		Do you make temples or something like that for different purposes? [sngazm.icon]

 They were two management people.
 	Scrapbox's advantages for management
 	 It's great to have a real-time view of all members' activities if you look at the "[Stream]" [shio.icon].
 		(Nanjisan) When it comes to Scrapbox, you can create pages without being formal (compared to Google Sites).

   	→I can't sleep at night.
   	The relationship between monitoring and being monitored
   	Individuals write a plan in Scrapbox that says, "I want to do this next.
   		Reliable, with the direction of travel visible without having to monitor the daily reports verbatim.
   		Trust is built on what you want to do, not what you could do.

 	How can motivation be created?
 	Sometimes it works rather well the first time, like when you want to clear up a problem in a spot where there is a goal [geta6.icon].
 	 Beyond that, it often does not lead to an ongoing stock of knowledge. [geta6.icon].
   It's like making a messy dictionary, just write it down as you see fit and let people correct it[shokai.icon].
    It may be difficult to get to the point where there is an expectation that "Here might be the information I want!"[geta6.icon It may be difficult to get to the point where there is an expectation that [geta6.icon].
	Two directions for introduction
		1. only those who know what they're doing can use it
				I see [yamanoku.icon].
				For Intelligent Workers
				→Making more friends.
				More examples of good use.
			It does not function well when used by people who do not understand it.

		2. a line to be used widely by everyone
				take time
	There was already a Wiki (Nanjisan)
		I transitioned first with only a team of 10 people I was looking at and saved the know-how on how to use it.
			There are also examples of mistakes that should not be used in this way.
				It is not a good idea to use it for something that is more useful with a hierarchical structure.
			Deploy company-wide after storing know-how

	A story about implementing Scrapbox with Scrapbox
		Functional design and consultation
			Ambiguous words
				You can write as many definitions as you like on separate pages.
			Important to be easy to "link" when referring to features that affect each other
		What is "context?"
	write crudely
		Others rewrite it on their own.
			OK as long as the meaning remains the same.
			Make jargon a link
 			Create a common language within the company
 				They start using the same words with the same meanings.
	I will write "I am" and "I think this."
	Make sense in context between pages.
	The meaning of terms is being defined.
	Not much of a roadmap.
		We have a blueprint.
			Suitable because it is an in-house developed product
		Assuming that the Web will become faster in the future, etc.
			I'm very suited to a lab-like organization.

No messaging.
	Not giving each other instructions.
		Share your thoughts and act on each of them.
		Let's reduce communication."
			Once you have a model of the other person's thinking in your mind, you'll know what they're thinking without having to verbally communicate with them.

	PWAs are vaguely defined.
		Web apps that are working hard.
		Store in cache
	You can reload and view the page even when wifi is turned off.
		I want to be able to edit offline.

	Completely independent from scrapbox.io and has the same infrastructure configuration
		→ should scale to the same degree.
