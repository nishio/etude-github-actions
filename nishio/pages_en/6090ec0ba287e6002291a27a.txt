 *1353827194*Nagisa Hamamura's Calculation Notebook
 My wife bought it for me because it looked interesting, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4062769816/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399& creativeASIN=4062769816&linkCode=as2&tag=nagisa_no_keisan-22">Nagisa Hamamura's Calculation Note</a>" which my wife bought because it looked interesting. This was quite interesting. Especially the ending of the log100 chapter is excellent.
 
 In a world where science and math classes have been cut by government policy, mathematicians have begun to resort to acts of terrorism in their quest to revive math education. This is the story of Nagisa Hamamura, a genius eighth grade math girl, who plays an active role.
 
 As an aside, at first I had no idea what log100 meant. Maybe it was because 1024 is a more rounded number than 1000 in my profession, or maybe it was because I had a time lag in understanding that the only number I could think of as the base of a logarithm was "e or 2? ......... Oh, I see, 10 is also possible.

 Oh, yeah, and on Twitter, "Can't 9 divided by 0 = 0?" I think those people should be told by Nagisa, "You can't divide by 0! I think they should be told "No, you can't divide by 0!
