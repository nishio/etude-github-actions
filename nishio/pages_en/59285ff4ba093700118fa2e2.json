The Place of Nothingness
[https://gyazo.com/be7065060716a0099e7831cc90402f00]
When considering the [extremes] of the particular and the general, the [limit] of the particular is the [individual thing], and the limit of the general is the [place of nothingness], according to [Ikitaro Nishida]. The thing X that "is" entails a place Y in the form of "X is in Y." If Y is there, it entails a place Z. If Y is there, it entails a place Z. If Y is there, it entails a place Z. If X is there, it entails a place Y. If there is a limit in the direction of this generalization, it can only be nothing, because if it is something, then there is something beyond it.

In the mathematical metaphor of the number line, this is "The small extreme of the natural number line is zero. Then what is the extreme on the large side? For any natural number X, there is a natural number X+1 that is larger than X+1. For any natural number X, there is a larger natural number X+1, so the "larger extreme" cannot be a natural number. The concept of "[infinity]âˆž" was introduced by mathematics to deal with such a concept, expressing something greater than any number.
