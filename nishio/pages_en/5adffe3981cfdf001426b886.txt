Lying
	It's not "lying is wrong, so don't do it."
 Lying" is simply damaging.
 People who lie must think it is in their best interest to lie.
 They think "the lie will never be exposed" because there is nothing to be gained by the lie being exposed.
 In fact, it is rather easy to find out.
 When Mr. A lies to Mr. B, Mr. A tends to think that Mr. B will make a decision based on the information he gives
 But in reality, Mr. B makes decisions based on information from various other people.
 Mr. A's lies are easily recognizable because they are inconsistent with other people's claims.
 People other than yourself do not exist in pieces, but form a dense network.
 The network is much stronger between you alone and a "network of many.
 Don't think you alone can lie and deceive.
 Why do you think you can't tell a lie?
 People don't bother to point out, "You're lying, aren't you?" when they think someone else is lying.
 So Mr. A thinks that he hasn't been caught in a lie.
 In fact, everyone except Mr. A thinks Mr. A is a liar, and there is an information network that hubs only Mr. A so that no victim is deceived by Mr. A. They share what Mr. A is saying and are vigilant.
	To lie is to be on the side of the hub.
