Imosu Act (fifth highest of the eight hereditary titles, later demoted to sixth highest of eight)
　Add the same value to a range of arrays
  [$ A_i ← A_i + X[s \le i < e] ] where s: start, e: end
　　This query is done Q times
　　O(NQ) when implemented naively.
　　Add only the beginning and end of the range first.
　　[$ B_i ← B_i + X[i = s] - X[i=e] ]
　　Then take [cumulative sum] and you get the same: O(N+Q)
　　[$ A_i ← A_{i-1} + B_i]
　　It's like calculating in derivative form and then integrating at the end.
