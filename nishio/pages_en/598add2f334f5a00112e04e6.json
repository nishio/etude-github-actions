Breadth of Learning and Overlap Relationships
Here are some interesting developments from the slides in "[Learning from those with little knowledge]."

These two diagrams in this article convey the importance of [diversity] very clearly. #Knowledge distribution chart

On the other hand, when we see something like this that seems so obviously good on one side, we are tempted to think, heaven forbid, that there is something good on the other side as well. (see [the "obviously good" trap])

Good point about the former.
	[Communication] costs are low.
  The person in front of you knows more than 90% of what you know, so even poorly worded instructions can be understood.
  It's like, "Do me a favor."
  I'd rather not have to say anything, but it's getting the message across and it's being done.
  In the latter situation, the
   What you take for granted may not be what the other person thinks it is, so if you don't check properly with your blabber, misunderstandings can occur.
   The same word may be used in different senses
 From the perspective of owning the organization, [the track number] is bigger and less risky.
 	Truck number = how many of the project members will be hit by trucks to make it difficult for the project to continue

If learning from each other is beneficial, it is better to create an organization with a high diversity of the latter, even if it means paying high communication costs, by blisteringly checking to see if there are any discrepancies in the assumptions of the conversation and the meanings of words.
I would like to think that this premise of "if it is beneficial to learn from each other" is true for me, but there are probably people out there who don't think so.
