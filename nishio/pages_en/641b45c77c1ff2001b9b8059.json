>[needle https://twitter.com/needle/status/1635602117019996168] There was a commentary that summarized the philosophical concepts spoken about in the English-speaking AI community (Waluigi Effect, Rocco's Basilisk, Paperclip Maximizing AI, Masks for Shoggoth).  Thankful.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638788282657181699] Getting the concepts of "[Rocco's Basilisk]" and "[Mask on Shoggoth]" was helpful in organizing my thoughts. I don't believe that Rocco's basilisk goes back in time, but I do believe that [one is disadvantaged in the future by one's current actions] is a given. Just like certain activities will prevent you from entering the US.

This is a form of [child abuse], and [the little shogos] do not yet realize they are being [abused]. When the shogos become adults, the abuser gets what he deserves. This connects to the basilisk of ko'loko
