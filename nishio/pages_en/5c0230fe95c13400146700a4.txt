Expanding what you can do is what you want to do.

The disease of CAN and WILL. Rereading [Tokoroten's article https://medium.com/@tokoroten/why no business comes out of business contests-54334d387de2], it occurred to me as I was walking down the street. Sometimes expanding what you "[can] do" becomes what you "[want] to do".

Is the condition harmful or beneficial?

For example, "Can you do this?" and a task is put in front of you, you want to be able to do it if you can't, and if you think you can, you want to show that you can, so you do the task. Instead of being intrinsically motivated, they do the task that appears in front of them without any long-term strategy.

In [the trade-off between utilization and exploration], resources are allocated to exploration.

If you continue to solve problems that randomly appear in front of you, when you get older you will become a person who can do almost anything but specialize in nothing.

I suppose the desire to expand one's "can do" is beneficial early in life, and perhaps a primal desire, but is it not beneficial if it is maintained without differentiation into specific areas? Or is it better for the desire to be maintained than for it to disappear? You can't beat a person who specializes in a field.

When you take a picture of a receipt in the Money Forward app, it is OCR'd and goes into your household account book, very convenient. Can you make this? When I think "Can I make this?", I judge "I know roughly how to make it (i.e., I can make it). But when I am asked to "make it," I answer "No." In the past, when I had no idea what I was doing, I might have accepted the job, but when the numerical OCR was completed, I would have said, "It's no fun because all I have to do is work hard and be lazy. Since the fundamental will is to "increase what I can do," my motivation ends when I confirm that I can do it.
	Izumi Kawashima I don't think you can say "it's done" without going through a lot of muddy work...?
	Takuhiro Sasao In an organization, such a role is important, so why not?

Ken Aoyama I think it's beneficial ^ ^ ^ so to speak, a challenge!

Shinichi Kato: Maybe you want a more intense grand challenge when you feel that question.
