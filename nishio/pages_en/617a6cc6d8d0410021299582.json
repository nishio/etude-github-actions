Nodal Point of Thought 2021-10-28
　I'm talking about the first time in two years that we can hold an offline meeting instead of a videoconference after we're done vaccinating.
 　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]What is the difference between online and offline?
 　　time constraint
 　　fully commit
 　　Engagement in conversation
　Hopefully something similar can be done online.
　　What's missing.
　　Engagement going down?
　　When I'm chatting with someone, I'll look at another page while I'm waiting for them to type.
　　I don't start up a phone game when I'm talking to someone face to face.
　　　This is a comparison of asynchronous chat vs. synchronous voice interaction, not online video conferencing vs. offline face-to-face conversation
　I'm going to come to work and talk to my colleagues in different departments," he said.
　　The premise of "come to work and talk to your co-workers" is not always True to begin with.
　　[nishio.icon]When I come to work, I don't have many voice conversations with my coworkers, and even less with people in different departments, so is it hard to feel the pain of the full remote of coronization?
　　　In fact, some of my colleagues hold weekly "snack meetings" with no theme, but I attended a few and didn't find much value in them, so I stopped attending them.
　Q: If Mr. Nishio feels that he would like to hold a physical event when he is done vaccinating, then there must be some value that he feels for a physical event.
　　[nishio.icon]That's rather clear
　　　If meeting in a conference room, a whiteboard is available
　　　My wife cares if I videoconference from home; if I go outside, I don't have that.
　　　What I'd especially like to do now is the type of conversation we can have while walking around the park.
　　　When I was on Zoom, I would have done it if I could have, but the signal was so bad on the course I wanted to walk that I couldn't.
　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]I hate that I feel like an old person who can't communicate without meeting.
　　[nishio.icon]Even unexplored juniors have mentors who go to meet the creators.
　　　Some mentors are actively involved in organizing the camp.
　　　As you can probably guess, I don't do it myself.
　　　　We do not want to reduce creators' options, so if a creator says, "I want to attend the camp," we say, "Go ahead," but when it comes to our own participation, we just say, "Are there enough mentors? If not, I'll go.
　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]When junior creators say, "We don't need offline meetings, everything should be online," it feels like the times have moved on.
　　　[nishio.icon]No, I don't think so.

　　　　The experience gained online and the experience gained offline are not inclusive, so "what you get when you do both" is greater.
　　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]I also did online and offline in the international exchange circle I did when I was a student, and even though we interacted a lot online, it was nice to be able to meet offline.
　[nishio.icon]It would be nice to have a festival to gather in the office.
　　If you gather in an office for work, it is difficult to talk to the people there because they are working
　　Then why not just have the festival four times a year?
　　　Every employee there is at the festival.
　　　A common context is created in which people gather for the purpose of offline communication.
　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]Emotion all swing event
 Is it communication to send out to Twitter?
 　Communication is...
 　[nishio.icon]Some people take communication in a narrow sense.
 　　[metaphor for face-to-face dialogue].
 　　　see [assumption of intent in statement].
 　　People who bring the metaphor of face-to-face interaction to groupware.
 　　　I'm wondering, "To whom did you address this post, and what kind of response did you expect?"
 　　　Assumption that speech is directed to a subject and requires a response
 　　Twitter and [minute report].
 　　　More and more people are disseminating information that is not a metaphor for talking to a specific person.
 　'I don't particularly expect a return on my Twitter postings'?
 　　I find that expression a little disconcerting.
 　　I expect a positive return as an expectation, but I don't expect a specific response from a specific person.
 　　[nishio.icon]Like stocks, investment
 　　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]Don't care about returns, are you looking for a large variance?
 　　　[nishio.icon]No, I care about returns, I compared it to stocks because the expected value is positive, not to pachinko, and pachinko is not an investment because the expected value is negative.
 　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon] This is not communication, you should assign some new words
 　　　[nishio.icon][Information dissemination gacha].
 　　　　[https://gyazo.com/91fb6a8b315a7f8bf597233b4a7a39cb]
　　　　　Zero in most cases, low probability of large returns changing.
　　　　　Gacha with low probability of SSR
　　　　　　What exactly? →After publishing the lecture materials, the editor contacted me to write a feature article.
　　　　　　　I think he started out publishing them because "it's convenient to publish them so they can be found in searches", but after drawing a few rare cards, he recognized their value as a gacha.
　　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]I guess every act is a mess.
　　　　Reading a book, playing a game, going to a new restaurant, messing around.
　　　　[nishio.icon]Washing dishes doesn't seem to be a mess.
　　　　　Uncertainty that occurs in daily chores is usually negative.
　　　　　　The shape of the probability distribution is different.
　　　　　　Big pluses with low probability" is important to the mess.
　　　　Like [Herzberg's two-factor theory], there are things that are natural to have and things that are natural not to have.
　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]Japanese people like messing around.
　　Lottery tickets, pachinko
　　[nishio.icon]Really?
　　　In "[risk-phobia]" where individuals deposit money around without buying stocks.
　　　The reason why there appear to be so many pachinko parlors is because they are located in front of train stations, and I don't believe that more than 50% of the population plays pachinko.
　　　People who don't like uncertainty are unlikely to be in our observation range in the first place, they don't take MOTs or CUMOTs.
　　　They both seem to be considered by people who don't like uncertainty, "What's he doing?" They'll think, "What's he doing?
　　　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon] People tend to say, "You're a man who does a lot of things," but even people who work for one company must be doing a lot of different jobs.
　　　　　[nishio.icon]It's the difference between what we equate and what we see as different [cognitive resolution].

subject
　I do it because it's "fun."
　Is there really a difference between INTERESTING and FUNNY?
　I think it's [exciting and unexpected].
　　[nishio.icon]Exciting and unexpected, in a mess?
　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon]Gacha can be predicted as "SSR thing when it hits.
　　So, there are no exciting surprises.
　　Similarly, a lottery ticket, where the winning amount is known, is exciting but not surprising.
　　[nishio.icon]I see, then my "information dissemination gacha" is also different from a gacha because "what will come out is unknown".
　Perspectives that find the unexpected interesting
　　[Tomoya Tachikawa.icon] The fun of comedy is also the unexpectedness of viewpoints.
　　[nishio.icon] That is, Mr. Tachikawa "thinks comedy with a surprising point of view is funny.
　　 For example, a new comedy, "Here comes the usual pattern, here comes the usual pattern, here comes the usual pattern! type of fun.
　Different people find different things interesting.
　　[People vary from person to person.]
　　Interesting, different possibilities for different people.
　　　[QUALIA]
　　What is 'interesting' to you?"
　　　It's funny how things fall apart.
　The resolution of your perception of what is "interesting" to you may have a strong influence on your happiness in life.
　　Thoughts on Interest
　　　The "consideration of fun" that comedians make is "what the public finds funny."
　　　What I want to discuss here is "what I personally find interesting."
　[What is "interesting?"]
　　Three years ago, we said, "We don't know what 'interesting' is, but we can subjectively judge whether something is interesting or not for each specific case. Then, let's collect interesting things first.
　　　[KJ method for "interesting"]
　　　As a result, "[people have individual differences]" was verbalized.
　　　 In other words, [Tomoya Tachikawa.icon] thinks it's interesting how different people are.
　　　[nishio.icon] found "[the human bug]" amusing.
　　Now, think again about "What is 'interesting'?
　　　What does that "interesting" look like?
　　　Where does it come from?
　　　What does it lead to?
　　This question is worth taking the time to address.
　　　Is that "interesting"?
　　　Some are interesting but not worth the time to work on.
　　　Worth spending an interesting time"?
　　　　It makes sense logically, but it doesn't feel right subjectively.

[obvious conclusion].
　It's very interesting, but when you put the conclusion into words, it sounds so obvious, why
　It is because we, who have repeatedly abstracted from a concrete case and unexpectedly came to that conclusion, do not have the "[surprising combination]" of "This is connected to that! but for those who are told of the conclusion after it has been reached, there is no such "unexpected connection.

[Thoughts depend on flow.]
　Written "conclusions" are only a snapshot of a certain time.
　　[Conclusions are a cross-section of the thought process.]
　Depending on the flow of events leading up to it, things will develop differently from there.
