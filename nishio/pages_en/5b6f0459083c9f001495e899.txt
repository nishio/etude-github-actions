Representation of hierarchy in Scrapbox
In the [1.5-level Table of Contents Digest] of the Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production, the following was initially written at the beginning of each page (URLs are omitted)
`[The Intellectual Production of Engineers Author's Official Page @Scrapbox] > [Contents digest <URL>] > [1.5 hierarchical version <URL>]`
But if I did this, the reverse link would cause links to all the table of contents digest pages to appear in one hop on the "official author page". I thought it would be a bit "too many paths and no translation".

So I decided to make a bust `[Engineer's Intellectual Production: Table of Contents Digest]`.
This doesn't really show my position in the whole, but there is only one link to the parent, so Scrapbox's network visualization works well.
