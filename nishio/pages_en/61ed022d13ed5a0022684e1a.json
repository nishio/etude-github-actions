About the title

Considering that the first book written on the KJ method was "Party Science," "The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production" is much better with "Intellectual Production" in it.

And it is ambiguous in Japanese whether "of" is "of" or "for".
(Although many people interpret it as for.)
[Overload of the engineer's intellectual production "of"].
