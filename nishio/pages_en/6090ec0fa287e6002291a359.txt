 *1483596045*A story about a 3D printer that made a cat feeder.
 At the end of the year, I read <a href='http://sftt.jp/2016/12/28/life-with-3d-printer/'>a friend's article</a> and thought that life with a 3D printer would be nice, so I decided to make a cat feeding table thinking about what I would make if a 3D printer came to my house. I'll think about whether or not to buy a 3D printer after I've been "living with a 3D printer in my house" for a while.
 
 This is what I make. If we put the feeding dish directly on the floor, it would be too low and hard to eat, so we put it on a suitable cardboard box, but it is dirty with oil stains from spilled rice and so on. I will replace it with a 3D printer output.

 The current box still looked low, so I made it a little higher and incidentally tilted it about 15 degrees toward the front. I placed a protrusion to hook in the hollow below the bait dish.

 I was a little worried about the stability, but I was willing to fix it if it didn't work. By the way, the tool is AUTODESK 123D and it is free. The time cost to create it is about 30 minutes. I just put rectangular and cylindrical primitives together in an appropriate way, joined them with boolean operations, and rounded the corners with Fillet, thinking that it would not be good if there were corners where the cat could touch.
 
 It arrived about 3 days after I ordered the output substitute. He was sniffing at the bottom stick for a while because he was unfamiliar with it, but he was convinced and started eating it. He doesn't seem to have any complaints. It could have been a little higher. The stability is unimpaired.

 What we learned this time
 
 I used <a href='http://make.dmm.com/print/about/'>DMM.make 3D printing</a>, which I used before, but the monetary cost is surprisingly high: about 20,000 yen. But I was about to buy a 50,000 yen 3D printer, so I decided that it would be good to run a prototype project for 20,000 yen, considering the "risk of buying it and not using it, taking up space and wasting money".
 
 The original article talked about PLA or ABS, but I didn't know what the equivalent options were, so I chose nylon. This is foreshadowed in later stories.
 
 After placing the order, it was pointed out to me that it would be cheaper to use <a href='https://www.3dhubs.com/'>3D Hubs</a> or something like that, so I tried it. It costs about 2,000 to 5,000 yen here. I'm going to print the same thing and try to compare the difference.
 
 When you submit a model, you will see a list of output agents. There were many displayed! I thought I saw a lot, but upon closer inspection, I found that only 4 of them were in Japan, and the rest were overseas. I wonder if the shipping cost should be the same as the price written. When you select an agent from the list, a chat-like screen appears. You communicate with the agent in English as you place your order. It is interesting.
 
 The first agent sent me a rejection message within about 30 minutes, saying "Design doesn't fit in my 3D Printer. For the special shape. Please consider other modeling methods and other hubs.
 
 The second agent responded in about 20 minutes with the same response, "Design doesn't fit in my 3D Printer. I'm sorry. machine's vibration makes not collect printing and height of model is too high for my printer".
 
 The third agent turned me down after about 20 hours. The reason was "Due to Holiday season, we can process this order." I guess they wanted to say "can't".
 
 I could not narrow down the search by "the size printer that can print this," so I selected an appropriate printer to try and narrow down the search, and did a lot of trial and error. I found out that their 3D printers cannot print this kind of shape without support material before the size does not fit. It would be too muddy. <a href='https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/supports-3d-printing-technology-overview#fdm'>Supports in 3D Printing: A technology overview | 3D Hubs</a> The nylon I chose from DMM.make happens to be a material that can be printed without support material. (It is a type of solidified powder, so the powder itself provides support.) <a href='https://www.3dhubs.com/material-group/sls-nylon'>SLS Nylon 3D Printing | 3D Hubs</a>
 
 I was going to try to print the same thing and compare what kind of difference there would be, but I came to the conclusion that I could not print the same thing.
 
 So I decided to divide the model into three parts using a boullion, and asked the second agent, "Can you print this?" The second agent replied, "Yes.

 But then he noticed that I was ordering from Japan and asked me "The price of overseas delivery is too much than this price of printing. are you sure this request is too much? I replied, "If it's less than $30, it's fine. I replied, "If it's less than $30, it's fine.
 
 You will not receive a reply from the destination here. It is the year-end and New Year vacations. Around this time you will receive output from DMM.com.
 
 When the vendor came back after opening the vacation, he pointed out that there was no positional tolerance (0.25~0.5mm). He said that he just used a boullion to separate them, so the hole and the rod to be put in it are the same size, but that won't make it stick. I thought that might be the case, but I didn't know how much thinner I could make it, so I thought I could just sand it down. Kindness~.
 
 Also, the vendor asks if he can remove the CUBS to hold the plates, and I ask him why he wants to remove them if they are on to hold the plates~? I ask him why he wants to take them off. It's a wai-wai situation. The model gets more and more complicated....

 If you enjoy this kind of interaction, using 3D Hubs would be a good idea, using DMM.make is by far less hassle, but the learning opportunities may be less. I would also like to try going to Techshop or something like that.
 
 (After writing this, I was wondering how much the first model would cost if output by SLS Nylon, so I checked and found that the closest was $96 from a Chinese vendor, the next was $140 US + shipping unknown, and the third was 670 AUD. I wish they would get their currencies together... :)
 
 Addendum: 1/10 "I've updated the delivery on this order to EMS. "EMS delivery payment is only posible pay in advance . delivery weight :150g. korea cuurent :17900won->14.82 dollor." and finally
 
 - Startup Costs $3.00
 - 17.6 &#10005; 17.2 &#10005; 3 cm $11.18
 - Shipping $14.82
 - Total	$29.00
 
 This is the amount of money that was used for the project.
 
 PS: I received it by EMS from Korea on 1/13.

 When assembled, it looks like this.

 The machining accuracy is as follows. As expected, there is a gap between the two parts, since the design was based on the idea that it is better to have a gap than not to have a gap. I glued it with cheap hot glue I bought at Daiso. It looks fine.
