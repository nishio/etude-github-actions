 I was outputting sequentially numbered videos in the Ore Ore library and it crashed with bad alloc. It seems to be a memory leak.
 
 I looked at it carefully and found that for some reason, "free" was commented out. What the heck is that?

 I've been trying to replace my me-me-me library with a GIL, but it's quite challenging. It's not good to be distracted easily. I even had to build the EEG sensor to remove the user current.

 There is a fumble between the shift register and the sound chip. I wonder if there is anything I can do about the cables that are all over the place.
