Monarch Morality and Slave Morality
A philosophical concept by [Nietzsche] (1844-1900). It classifies two types of human thinking.
First published in "[Beyond the Shore of Good and Evil]" and developed in "[Moral Genealogy]".

[Good or bad, beneficial or harmful?]
 In [monarchical morality], actions are divided into "good" and "bad.
  Good things are useful, bad things are harmful.
   [Pragmatistic
  My [values] determine whether it's good or bad.
 In [slave morality], actions are divided into "good" and "evil."
  The implicit assumption is introduced that "the rulers are evil" and "we who are ruled are good."
  The "majority is good" is used to justify this.
  The governed are evil because they are less than the governed
   The ruler has power and the ruled does not. Therefore, power is evil.
   The ruler has money and the ruled do not. Therefore, money is evil.
  [Equality is good.
  	Putting monarchs on the same footing as slaves.
  Since the majority is good, [democracy] based on voting and majority rule is good

The early [aristocracy] was based on the morality of a monarch who, in exchange for the responsibility of fighting on the front lines in times of war, was willing to do what was good for him or her. With the modernization of the military, the nobility no longer fought on the front lines, and the justification was lost. 1789-1799 French Revolution overthrew absolute monarchy and became a republic (democracy) (well, it was replaced by Napoleon's dictatorship in 10 years).
