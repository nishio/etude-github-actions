You're still holding him.
Monks A and B were walking along the road when they saw a young woman having trouble jumping over a stream.
B thought that it was not good that A held the woman. After a while, he said, "It is not good to hold a woman."

B "It is not good to hold a woman."
A "Hm? A woman? Where is she?"
B "You held me at the creek just now!"
A "Oh, I sure held him. And I dropped him off by the river. You were still holding it."
