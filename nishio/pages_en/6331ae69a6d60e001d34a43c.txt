QR
Difficult to communicate URLs and social networking IDs in a physical setting because humans still communicate using noisy voice channels
But more and more people have smartphones and can use the "take a picture of the QR code" method.
For iOS at the moment, long press on the QR code part of the image to open it.
Many social networking sites have their own QR code reading capabilities.

So I thought it would be useful to create a page in my Scrapbox with a collection of QR codes to tell people about it.
