 *1221810268*gcc -S reading
 I can still read a small sample if I try hard enough, but when it comes to actual code on the scale of "let's speed this up", I can't figure out what's going on. I wonder if there is some way to mark it well.
 
 >||
 .globl __Z10get_centeriii
 __Z10get_centeriii:
 ||<
 
 Ah, so this is the function that takes three integers named get_center. I see. I was expecting inline expansion, but it doesn't work! (Oh!
 
 I put "inline" at the beginning and it disappeared.

 Sasada asm(" # hogehoge ");

 Oh! That's exactly what I was looking for! >asm("#hogehoge");
 I was thinking that I didn't know where the operator() of a particular class starts, but after adding that, it became obvious at a glance!
 
 *1221810391*I'm not feeling well.
 I was on my way home from the pharmacy to buy some kind of throat spray when I started having heart palpitations.... I was just walking...
 Health is important. Moo.
 I will attend the Young Scientists in Information Science meeting tomorrow, but I may have to go to bed early or something.

 I went to bed after writing this and just woke up @ 10:33am.
 I was sweating and flinching.
 
 **1221842397* Make programming languages a tourist attraction.
 >>
 I have a question for those who are familiar with Japanese tourist attractions. I have a friend who is coming to Japan next time, and he asked me absurdly to tell him about some tourist attractions that he must visit.
 <<
 I've never been out of Honshu, but I still recommend Mt. Takao! What? Nagasaki? Who would go that far away from home? I don't like it when people answer, "I've never been out of Honshu, but I recommend Mount Takao! We are not asking such a person's opinion.
 
 However, we can't interview every single survey respondent, so let's just narrow it down by asking appropriate questions.
 
 -Okinawa's governor is Hideki Nishijo.
 -Okinawa has the largest lake in Japan at its center.
 -Okinawa is famous for being the first place to see the first sunrise of the year because it is the farthest east in Japan.
 -Okinawa has a distinctive national costume.
 -Okinawa is a region of heavy snowfall, and buildings are steeply sloped to prevent snow accumulation.
 -Okinawa produces a lot of sugar from sugar beets.
 -Okinawa is located on the Oyashio and Kuroshio tidal channels and has a rich variety of fish and shellfish.
 -Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University is the 10th largest public university in Japan in terms of students
 -When Miyakejima erupted, the fumes created a smog over all of Okinawa.
 -Shuri Castle in Okinawa is the oldest wooden structure in Japan.
 -The distance between Okinawa and Oahu is closer than the distance between Tokyo.
 
 Then I got about 19 incorrect answers out of 20. And then they scolded me, "Only Okinawans would understand! And then they scolded me, saying, "You are an idiot to think that you can answer such a question. Hmmm, you mean you don't know if smog has occurred in Okinawa unless you live there? I've never heard of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, so how could I possibly answer the question? That's not the point. I don't know who the governor of Okinawa is either, but I don't think it is Hideki Nishijo.
 
 I don't mean to denigrate your personality or say that you are not Japanese just because you have never left the mainland. You don't like traveling that much, do you? I don't think that's a bad thing. It's simply that I don't listen to the opinions of people like that.

 story in a way that is easy for non-programmers to understand.
 
 On the other hand, I have heard from more than a dozen people that "it's not difficult" and "even if you don't know Scheme, you can easily narrow it down to two or three pieces. I'm sorry, but I thought afterwards that I should have made it so that you can narrow it down to one even if you don't know Scheme. Or, at the very least, I should have made it so that you could understand it by looking at Wikipedia. But it's hard to come up with 12 questions like that.

 Compared to some users who are verbally abusive, this high school student is cool!

 Also, there seems to be a misconception that I am a Scheme user in part, but the last time id:snow-bell asked me how to solve a Fibonacci sequence problem and I wrote it down, it may have been the first time this year. Since the question was posed by someone who only uses Scheme with such frequency, I was rather scared that there might be a mistake in the choices.

 This is interesting and I will give it a try.
 PS: I made a large number of wrong choices in Java, but I think I made it more difficult because I know more than Scheme. I'll have someone check it out.

 From a buzzard comment:
 >>
 id:sshi Maybe this problem had the same root as the "Hoge Language Paradox" / people who didn't understand the intent of Q1 don't even realize that they don't "get it".
 <<
 I see. I was thinking, "I don't mind not knowing Scheme at all, but it's not a question about the depth of knowledge of Scheme," but I guess I don't understand that it is such a question.

 They have novelty goods!
 
 By the way, it's today and I still haven't figured out the traffic.

 They say we should be in Gotemba at 12:00.

 And I discovered a serious problem when I tried to send transit information to my cell phone... I can no longer send emails from GMail to my cell phone. To the mail address . _. I was happy that I didn't receive any spam at all, but I didn't know that I can't send from GMail anymore. This is a problem.
