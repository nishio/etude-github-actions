ã€€Thoughts.
ã€€ã€€Choose some of the 20 or so prime numbers and cover the whole thing.
ã€€ã€€Of the methods, the one with the lowest cost
ã€€ã€€There are 50 objects to be covered, and having "what is covered" in bits is a bit too much at 2^50.
ã€€ã€€Minimum cut?
ã€€ã€€If the cost is the product of each option â†’ logarithm, it is the sum.
ã€€ã€€Cost minimization is minimum cut
ã€€ã€€I thought I'd implement it and see...
ã€€ã€€ã€€I don't know how to express "either prime factor 2 or prime factor 5 must be S" when there are 10
ã€€ã€€AC by the greedy method of taking prime numbers, which are the divisors of many numbers, in order.
ã€€ã€€ This is a false solution
ã€€ã€€ I would choose 2 for 3,5,7,6,10,14 or something like that, but it's right not to.
ã€€ã€€Since there are 15 prime numbers, we can afford to do a full search of 2^15=32768 cases
