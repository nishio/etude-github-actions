　Thoughts.
　　You are given a highly flexible representation of the placement of the dominoes, but essentially all you need is a "place them vertically" or "place two horizontally" column. Convert to that first.
　　when the foreground is horizontal
　　　Verticals have only one way to paint.
　　　The sides are three ways: ba, bc, and ca, with ab in the foreground.
　　when the foreground is vertical
　　　Vertical is two ways
　　　There are two sides, bc and cb, with a in the foreground.
　　The first three ways are vertical, and the sixth way is horizontal.
　　The rest can be calculated in any order.
　　[Only the last minute is relevant.]
