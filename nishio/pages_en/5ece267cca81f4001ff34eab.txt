Advancing the Project
　Let many people know
　　useful
　When many people know about it.
　　Increases the probability of encountering people who react negatively.
　　inevitable
　　Need to be able to go through it.
　Positive and negative people
　　exist as a fact
　　You can't erase it.
　　Just like cicadas chirp in the summer.
　　　Cicadas are noisy.
　　　Cicadas come out every year.
　　　natural phenomenon (phenomena)
　　No one has ever died because of noisy cicadas.
　　　It's no big deal.
　When you are attacked, do you want to fight back?
　　Especially when they're misinterpreting and saying things that aren't right, you want to point out that they're not.
　　If your goal is to get the project right, they're happy to change their minds when you point it out.
　　Not so for those whose goal is to deny the project.
　　If you completely debunk it, you just go to someone else.
　　　Lost time never comes back.
　　It is not beneficial to the project to deal with such people.
　Putting all my energy into my projects
　　Best Rebuttal.
　Afraid of negative feedback?
　　Knowledge is the antidote to fear.
　The parable of the frightened cat
　　A frightened cat tries to make its body look as large as possible and makes loud, aggressive shearing noises
  People who try to make themselves look as big as possible and make loud, aggressive statements resemble frightened cats.
  If you put your hand out, you'll get bit.
 Monarch Morality and Slave Morality
 　Nietzsche noted that there are two different ways of thinking about "goodness."
 　Herrenmoral (master morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)
 　　Is it beneficial to the realization of the objectives?
 　　Beneficial is good, harmful is bad.
 　Sklavenmoral (slave morality, as a philosophical concept of Nietzsche)
 　　Majority is good.
 　　Monarchs and other rulers are evil because they are few.
 　　They are good because they are the majority who are governed
 　　Rulers have the power, we don't.
 　　　To have power is evil.
 　　　Only a few people having power is evil, equality is good.
 
　What is power?
　　Programming skills, $500,000 budget, fast PCs, support from mentors, ability to attract an audience for results reporting sessions...
　　Beneficial for achieving project objectives

Ask questions and get more information!
　Example
　Suggestion that "X should be changed to Y."
　I don't know what problem you are trying to solve by making the change -> "What problem is the change trying to solve?"
　I don't see how solving that problem relates to the project's objectives -> "How does this relate to the project's objectives?"

It would be better to follow up with something like "Neither of the two ways of thinking is correct" because it would not be good to create a sense of selectivity. Although the relativism of correctness is what we want to convey in the first place, it is difficult to do so after only 10 minutes of talking.
>I fundamentally don't get along with people who think like that.
> It's a waste of time to argue with someone of that ideology.
> = not beneficial to the achievement of project objectives
