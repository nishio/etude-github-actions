 I'm not really interested in increasing the number of female participants in the 1000 speaker conference, and I'm disgusted by people who attend for the purpose of meeting women. amachang is probably no different.
 But in the larger story of "lowering the threshold for presentation", I think we should remove the obstacle of "all men, scary and difficult to participate". I would like to ask id:pinkmac to share his know-how in this area.
 
 *1206433123*[Mac][AS3][AS3] development environment under construction.
 Build an ActionSctipt development environment on your MacBook now.

 First, insert the flex 2 sdk.
 
 -----
 
 While waiting, put rascut. gem install rascut
 
 -----
 
 No. sudo gem install rascut
 
 -----
 
 Mystery that when I try to download flex 2 sdk, it asks me to download Flex Builder 3 trial version

 Documentation ZIP will be 404.

 Pass mxmlc. mxmlc where?
 find / -name "mxmlc"
 /Applications/Adobe Flex Builder 3/sdks/3.0.0/bin/mxmlc
 
 -----
 
 I messed with .bash_profile but forgot to escape the spaces in the path and it breaks the path.
 Fix it and start over.
 
 -----
 
 java command not found
 I just added the correct mxmlc path before the broken path, so it just doesn't pass through to java, but I haven't noticed it yet.
 
 -----
 
 I went to Sun's site and there is no SDK for Mac.
 
 -----
 
 I notice that java 1.5.0 is included from the beginning.
 
 -----
 
 For some reason, rascut does not work.

 RASCUT moved.

 Maybe I should have just used ALIAS without hand-patching?

 Putting in log.as. I wonder which is the latest log.as.
 http://subtech.g.hatena.ne.jp/secondlife/20070219/1171872801
 I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do.

 Where should we put log.as?
 
 /Applications/Adobe Flex Builder 3/sdks/3.0.0/frameworks/flex-config.xml
 Do you want to keep it on the side of the

        mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory
 Hmm?
 
 Ah!
 $ mv ../log.as /Applications/Adobe\ Flex\ Builder\ 3/sdks/3.0.0/frameworks/
 Like this.
 Blank spaces in the path are annoying.
 
 $ ln -s /Applications/Adobe\ Flex\ Builder\ 3/sdks/ flex3sdk_ln
 That's it.
