Masakari 2
2021-10-11
Topics related to the feedback of the judge "I am angry" in a contest in which technical college students participated.

>[YoshifumiSeki https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1447157487279357958]: I guess, communication like that was a popular way of "throwing masakari" in the engineering community about 10 years ago, so I feel that the people who defend it are of that generation. I think the people who are advocating it are of that generation.
>[YoshifumiSeki https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1447157673313505282]: In that sense, the world has improved a lot since 10 years ago!

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1447283363409121280]: no, from my point of view, who used "throwing masakari" in a positive way, I feel that "I am angry" is a different act from "throwing masakari", because it is an emotion. (This is an example of the act of throwing masakari)
 >[otsune https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1447321902565842944]: There is a gap phenomenon where a mere technical point by a programmer is perceived as "fried", "stingy with work" or "defamation" in the context of non-programmers I agree.
 > which was coined in the beginning, so a statement that is power harassment or declaring that you are angry is clearly a different act.
 >I'm simply angry.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1447284594508591105]: "Throwing mazakari" is to point out errors in the presentation, based on the premise that "factually incorrect understandings should be corrected in the public interest", and as for "angry", it's more like "that's your subjective opinion, isn't it? As for "I'm angry," it's more like "That's your subjective opinion, isn't it? I think it is an act of "throwing masakari".
	>[kazuho https://twitter.com/kazuho/status/1447333001990270979]: I think this tweet sums up both the good and bad points of "throwing masakari". （Focusing on the content of the discussion (not the debaters) is a good point. The bad point is that it neglects to ensure psychological safety in order to do so. I think we now need to strive to satisfy both at the same time #self-discipline method.
  >[anohana https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1447363367362973701]: you need a safe space to have frank discussions, and when the community was small, the participants were filtered before they entered the space, so they didn't care. Maybe that's why they didn't care.
  >[anohana https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1447363369262936066]: In acting classes, sensitive points may be raised about individuals, and psychological safety is extremely important in order to discuss these points without blurring them. It is always made clear to everyone in advance that "topics discussed here will remain in this room only" and that "remarks will be made about expression, not personalities.

  >[anohana https://twitter.com/anohana/status/1447363934344736773]: The "masakari" of the hacker community is easy to see the problem because it is visible online, but the disregard for psychological safety is a problem that has been around for a long time in many places, club activities, workplaces I think it's a problem that's always been there, even in the workplace.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1447285790170509312]: When the presenter says, "Keep on throwing the masakari," he doesn't mean, of course, "Keep on throwing the emotional tirade." To rephrase it in current language... "Now I am going to give an error-free explanation, but there may still be errors, so if you notice them, please point them out to me.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1447286929968406529]: here is a summary of "the fact that masakari was actually used positively in the past" two years ago [masakari].
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1447292310148943874]: Related [what the heck X].
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1447304041634025474]: drew a four-panel comic strip [the concept that the words refer to expands and contracts to become something else].

>[otsune https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1447369064729300994]: a topic related to "when a programmer writes bad code and others point it out".
>For some reason, most people only think of situations where newbies write poor code and are scolded by veterans, but when I was observing the origin of the coined term, I was focusing on cases where "even core developers are being pointed out poignantly without being disciplined".
 >[otsune https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1447369574576316419]: When it comes to programming, if you write bad code, even if you are a big shot, it will be pointed out to you, and if you do the right thing, even if you are young, it will be accepted.
 >I coined the term in 2007 because I thought this phenomenon was different from other phenomena in society.
 >[otsune https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1447370679267987462]: Somehow the expression "throwing masakari", derived from a coined word, seems to have lost its original meaning and is used in the superficial sense of "programmers rudely making attacks of harsh remarks". It seems to be used in the superficial sense of "programmers rudely and bitterly pointing out attacks".
 >It's just someone pretending to be a PATCH and wanting to DIS someone else is pretending that "this is masakari", which is not the original meaning.

>[otsune https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1447372352904331264?s=21] In the past, when yoshiori posted that he wanted to create a term to distinguish between true masakari and DIS who pretend to be masakari, I replied, "Even if you create a new term I replied, "Even if you create a new term, people who DIS will only DIS by pretending to be the new term, so you will never be able to distinguish them.

>[tomoyaman https://twitter.com/tomoyaman/status/1447374909752049667]: did no one in the community define the term "throwing masakari"?
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1447375738219347971]: we defined it and then people started using it differently without reading the definition and it became the majority.
 >[otsune https://twitter.com/otsune/status/1447377595109036032]: to explain in a serious way.
 >There are many exchanges of PATCHes and points of view that are amusing to the customs of non-programmers (the majority of society), mainly in open source development, and the impression gap was first described as "throwing a hand axe" as an ironic joke.
 >Now there are cases where DIS is claimed to be masakari.
