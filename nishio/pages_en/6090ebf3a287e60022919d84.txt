 *1194673819* What is a geek?

 Ã—x I can write in 3 lines of code that would take a geeky geek 100 lines of code to explain.
 
 It takes a geek 1000 lines of code to write what it takes a bebokeek 100 lines of code to write, but it is 10 times lighter and faster.

 I feel uncomfortable with the
 A 100 lines of code written by an inexperienced programmer is actually a code that can be written with 30 lines of code, so it is not so great even if it is 10 times lighter after being expanded by 30 times. Of course, it would be useful in an industry that requires crunchy tuning.
 
 Personally, I think geek is not an extension of the normal (common sense) programmer's line of "take the time and effort to make it faster" or "take the time and effort to make it a generic design", but something with a more magical element that is far from common sense. It's more like, "Oh, there's a solution to that? I think it's more like "Oh, that's the way to solve it?
 
 
 
 Also, script kiddies are not a type of programmer...

 I remember when Dr. Zetsubou said that.

 I am talking about Cybozu's headquarters, where we are holding a recruiting session for new graduates.
 
     - Briefing Schedule
 
 What is interesting is that the briefings are divided by type. The types are as follows
 
     - Humanities job applicants
     - Athletic person
     - People who wish to develop software

 It's an interesting company, if I say so myself as a subsidiary employee. I heard that amachang will be at the information session for people who want to develop software. I want to go and listen to what he has to say. I'm sure it will be very interesting.

 And it is clearly clad in an aura of disaster. It is definitely a household of darkness.
 I think it is "summoning magic" that creates these creatures that seemingly do not follow the physical laws of this world.
 This kind of thing is not a problem if you summon something from the magical world as a story and make a show of it, but if you use the power of darkness without need in your daily work or work codes, especially codes you share with others, you will be called a "black magic user" or "you have fallen to the dark side", so be careful. If you use forbidden spells half-heartedly, you will end up paying a high price.
 
 <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Hamachiya2/20070804/browser_crasher">A line of brilliantly shooting down IE - I'm Machi-chan! (Hatena)</a> or something like that is attack magic. Probably red magic. Only a handful of people can develop new spells because they require a deep understanding of the subject, but they generate a lot of script kiddies because they are easier to exercise than to create.
 
 Refactoring and coding conventions (like <a href="http://oldriver.org/python/pep-0008j.html">PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code</a>) are healing magic and white magic. The art of healing a body wounded by battle, making it more flexible, and blessing it for the next fight. However, it cannot fight the enemy by itself. ((There are reports that it is possible to damage some "supposedly dead but still moving" undead projects with blessing magic, but some say that it can only reduce them to half of their maximum HP, and white magic alone is still not enough to defeat them.))
 
 Frameworks (such as <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django | The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines</a>) are support magic. Probably green magic. A magic circle that increases the magic power of the surgeon. Especially in cases where magic is used in the preparation of the magic circle itself, a magic circle is deployed with just a few spells, and even inexperienced surgeons can be highly productive by working within the magic circle. On the other hand, as the skill of the surgeon improves, there are cases where he or she will act in ways that are unexpected by the green mage who designed the magic circle, which can be a problem in reverse. For example, you shouldn't put on a headdress of the opposite attribute and cast a speed-enhancing support spell, or you shouldn't put a bag in the bag of preservation. Various.
 
 I don't know much about blue and yellow magic, but I think blue magic is an approach that tries to solve things through the power of abstraction and mathematics, like lambda calculus or monoids, and yellow magic is an approach that tries to solve things through the power of a large library of CPANs or CTANs or something. I think yellow magic is an approach that tries to solve things by the power of many libraries like CPAN or CTAN. It is no coincidence that green magic is a mixture of blue and yellow magic.
 
 It's hard to say what I would recommend for a beginner in programmatic magic,
 
 - Beware of black magic: It is okay to get involved in it, but do not lose the awareness that you are dealing with evil. Be careful not to fall to the dark side.
 - Many people have a hard time with blue magic. It is easier to have a real experience and then abstract it than to learn an abstract story first. You'll figure out the advanced stuff later, so just don't listen to it.
 - Yellow magic is catchy and easy to do great things, but be careful, because if you keep using it, you will have a hard time leaving the environment where you can use the magic, and your footwork will become heavier and heavier. Kirenger loves curry.
 - Red magic is a thorny issue. If you accomplish great things, you can be busted or arrested for the opposite.
 - Although white magic does not directly lead to results, it is essential when fighting a large enemy and should not be underestimated.
 - I would recommend using green magic, a mixture of blue and yellow magic, to maintain motivation in an environment where you can easily achieve results, while reading the sources to increase your knowledge of blue and white magic.
 
 So Django is good, Django!

 - Is binary hacking black magic? Is machine language black magic? I feel resistance to lumping them all together as "evil because they are black magic. The abyss. He who looks into the abyss will be looked into by the abyss.
 - Maybe there are two kinds of black magic, one is the black magic and the other is the muddy black magic.
