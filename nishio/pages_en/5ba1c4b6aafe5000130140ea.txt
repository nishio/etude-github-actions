Simpson's paradox
>Simpson's paradox or [the Yule-Simpson effect] is a [statistical] paradox described by E. H. Simpson in 1951. Correlations in a population may differ from correlations in a population divided into two. In other words, a hypothesis may be true when the population is divided into two groups, but the opposite hypothesis may be true for the population as a whole.
[Simpson's paradox - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%82%BD%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E3%83%91%E3%83%A9%E3% 83%89%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9]

[$ A/B > a/b,\quad C/D > c/d ] but can also be [$ (A+C)/(B+D) < (a+c)/(b+d)].

	Example 1
 	The average scores are related to 100>90 and 10>0, respectively, but the overall average is reversed because there are many (9) people with "average scores of 90" and "average scores of 10".
 	(100 * 1) / 1 > (90 * 9) > 9
  (10 * 9) / 9 > (0 * 1) > 1
  190 / 10 < 810 / 10
 Example 2
 	Originally both were 2/4, but by dividing them differently, each can win a split.
 	2 / 4 = 2 / 4 
  1 / 1 > 2 / 3
  1 / 3 > 0 / 1

	Explanation of why we shouldn't have tried to interpret causality in a data-driven way.
 Even if the data is exactly the same, it is different whether it is correct to compare with or without splitting
