 *1291642012*I put about a million files in the same folder with NTFS.
 I've plotted the data of how many seconds it took to put 1,000 files of 4KB each in NTFS, because it seems to get slower when you put a lot of files in a folder, and it only takes less than 0.5 seconds to write some of them up to 20,000 or a few tens of thousands. The performance seems to be better for the smaller number, but beyond that, there is not much difference. The average time is about 1.8 seconds.

 Next time I feel like it, I'll measure up to 50,000 every 10 cases or so.
