Write in Scrapbox and share via link
	Formerly titled "Scrapbox and GoogleDocs
		I thought, "This is useful, I'll summarize it" after a lively discussion in the chat room.
  	I put it together in Scrapbox.
   When I want to share it with the people who participated in the chat, Scrapbox doesn't allow me to "share by link".
		I can't put the story on my public because I can't disclose it.
 	Even if you create a new PRIVATE project...
  	Invite links cannot be placed on individual pages.
   It's a two-step process: "Enter the group through this link, and then look at this page."
  Use case: "I want to put a link and say, 'Here's the summary.
		I wonder if I'll be able to port what I'm putting together now to Google Docs and "[link to share]" later.

 I slept through the night and woke up and came up with a solution.
  After summarizing in Scrapbox, convert to Markdown with bookmarklet
	 	[I wrote a Bookmarklet that converts text from Scrapbox pages to Markdown using http://daiiz.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/02/17/074508]
  Just paste that Markdown into [HackMD - a collaborative editable Markdown notebook https://hackmd.io/
  	Only people who know the link can [co-edit].
  However, the above bookmarklet does not convert nested bullets correctly at this time.
  	OK if the output after conversion is `s/^( +)/\1\1/`.
   	Feedback has been provided to the author.
	 Hopefully Markdown export will be officially supported in the future.

 Scrapbox's strength is its page-to-page linking, so for the purpose of sharing a single page, it's honestly not much different from other services.
 	Conversely, I have no problem writing in Scrapbox, I just need to be able to export one page in Markdown without stress.
  Is the advantage of having a full set of shortcuts regarding bullet organization?
  	[/help/outline editing].

 GoogleDocs has the advantage that it has a full range of "comment" and "edit diff" functions, although it was concluded that GoogleDocs will not be used this time.
 	However, for the use case of "I summarized the discussion in the chat room", the highlighting of the edited differences is not necessary.
  It seems that Dropbox is creating a culture of using bullet points as a tree board for commenting.
  	There is a problem with the lack of separation between the text and comments.
 	Useful for correcting web articles and such.

 [https://www.dropbox.com/paper Dropbox Paper] is also used for one of my jobs
 	The main difference when compared to the other three methods is...
  	Is it just the Dropbox icon in the task tray by default that notifies me of updates?
		[How to notify users of updates is an important factor in ensuring that they continue to use the product.
  	Another time.

	Another issue is if you share it on HackMD and then edit it, how do you get it back into Scrapbox?
  If you were editing only on HackMD, you can convert it back to Scrapbox and overwrite it.
  If you were also editing in Scrapbox, how would you merge the two, which raises the question.
  Merge both as Markdown?
