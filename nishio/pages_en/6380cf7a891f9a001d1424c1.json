Illustrate the following story about [2 hop link
[/shokai/2 hop link]
>Unexpected, unexpected, and forgotten pages that you think are here the moment you see them are suggested in the [list of related pages].

>I often think "Oh wow!", [/shokai/shokai.icon] is a suggestion that exceeds my expectations.
> 1. page of concrete things → page of abstract concepts → page of another concrete thing
> 2. abstract concept page → concrete thing page → another abstract concept page
> By either of these, the thought jumps
> Can move back and forth between concrete and abstract in a mutually complementary manner
> These things have simply not been thought about much in what used to be called "linking", have they?

This is what the diagram represents

　1:

　Create a page for some abstract concept x, and make links to concrete things a, b, c that support it.
　　Pages a, b, and c do not have to exist
　　This is forgotten after a while.

　Notice that c becomes [blue link
　Scrapbox will make a blue link when it connects with 2 hop link even if page c does not exist.
　　2 hop link column shows x connected via c
　　It becomes, "Whoa, my past self is writing something relevant."
　　　= Reminds me of things I've forgotten.

relevance
　Collecting only abstract concepts that are disconnected from concrete experience is not recalled and is not reusable.
　　[Knowledge of Rootless Grass]
　　　Talk about knowledge that is difficult to apply unless it is connected to concrete experience.
　　[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected].
　　　If you take an abstract concept that someone else has and bring it to you, disconnected from its connection to concrete experience, it will not work the same way for you as it does for that person.
