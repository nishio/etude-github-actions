Combination in mod P
Combination ([binomial coefficient])
[$ _nC_k = C(n, k) = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}]
for large numbers n and k.

Assume that the value in mod P is good.
 Once that is obtained, the original value can be recovered from multiple values by the [Chinese remainder theorem].

After taking the remainder, no ordinary division can be performed.
Then calculate and multiply by [the inverse original in mod P].
　For single-shot calculations, create an inverse original in logarithmic order.
　If you want to calculate a large number of calculations, you can create [inverse source tables], and each one will be of constant order.
