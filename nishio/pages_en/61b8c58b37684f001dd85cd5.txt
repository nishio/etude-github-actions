Is the technology lasting longer or are people staying?
When someone A says about a technology X, "X is a long-lasting technology, I use it for a long time, therefore X is good," whether technology X is really what that person A interprets it to be, or whether A is just staying in the range ([comfort zone]) of "what X can do" is [an identical observation from different perspectives of the phenomenon].
