 id:TAKESAKO told me that Fibonacci means son of Bonacci, so I look it up on Wikipedia
 
 - Fibonacci's real name is Leonardo da Pisa.
 - Fibonacci is a nickname derived from the phrase "son of Bonaccio", and his father Bonaccio is also a nickname meaning "simple", not his real name
 - He realized that the Arabic numeral system was more efficient at a time when Europe was still using Roman numerals to write XVII and so on, and traveled to Egypt, Syria, and Greece, where he published what he learned in "The Book of Arithmetic".
 - The Fibonacci sequence was only introduced, not discovered by me.
 
 By all accounts, he should be remembered more as "the man who introduced Arabic numerals to Europe" than as the Fibonacci sequence!
