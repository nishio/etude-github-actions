What type of user is this user?
I> User who is trying to do some kind of intellectual production
he> Where is that user?
I> hmmm, well, it's across the net.
He> Is there anything else about that other side?
I> Chat text communication, so we have a human and an interface.
he> Is there anything else about that interface?
I> Physical human communication interfaces have information such as tone of voice and facial expressions, but with chat, there is no such information.
He> Is there anything else about that communication?
I> I believe that tone of voice and facial expressions are beneficial for grooming purposes of communication, but not for logical communication.
he> What type of communication is that communication?
I> What this system supports is not emotion or empathy, but the kind of communication that helps people find logical connections by weaving sentences.
he> Where is that communication?
Me> Here it is. Looks like it's working fine for now.
