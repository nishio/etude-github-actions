Perfect Bayesian equilibrium
Equilibrium placed on the game with incomplete information
> In game theory, a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) is an equilibrium concept relevant for dynamic games with incomplete information (sequential Bayesian games).

>A PBE is a refinement of both Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) and subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE). A PBE has two components - strategies and beliefs:
> 
> The strategy of a player in given information-set determines how this player acts in that information-set. The action may depend on the history. This is similar to a sequential game.
> The belief of a player in a given information-set determines what node in that information-set the player believes that they are playing at. The belief may be a probability distribution over the nodes in the information-set (particularly: the belief may be a probability distribution over the possible types of the other players). Formally, a belief system is an assignment of probabilities to every node in the game such that the sum of probabilities in any information set is 1.
> The strategies and beliefs should satisfy the following conditions:
> 
> Sequential rationality: each strategy should be optimal in expectation, given the beliefs.
> Consistency: each belief should be updated according to the strategies and Bayes' rule, in every path of positive probability (in paths of zero probability, aka off-the-equilibrium paths, the beliefs can be arbitrary).
> A PBE is always an NE but may not be an SPE.
