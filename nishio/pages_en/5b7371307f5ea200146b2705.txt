	To get from A to B, you have to invest a great deal of energy once to get past the C barrier.
 Low C makes it "doable," but anything with low C is a [red ocean] because anyone can enter
  [Barriers to entry]
 The perception of "low C" may itself be a fallacy.
  There are problems I don't know about.
  Mis-estimating the height of the mountain.
	Find something that has a high C pile and only they have the [catalyst] to lower it.
 After exceeding, B must be in a state where energy is available from outside

 	Stable without continually putting energy into it.
 	That is, the [energy level] must be lowered
  Taking money out of the equation increases the B energy level.
