I'd like to discuss a bug that caused a mysterious log breakdown.
summary
　I had a bug that I didn't understand, so I asked for help with a problem.
　The initially perceived "log breakdown" turned out to be an incorrect perception of the phenomenon.
　　Correct: "The log splits into two conversations."
　It's a relief to know that the logs haven't been lost.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I'd like to discuss a bug that caused a mysterious log breakdown.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "bug" is that "bug"?
The first few lines of the [nishio.icon] log are lost. The beginning of the log is also lost in the data stored on the server.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "log" is that "log"?
[nishio.icon] Conversation log. A list of what the user typed in the chat and what the bot replied.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "log"?
[nishio.icon]In the first place, the server is supposed to send a single line of statements to the server and do the addition on the server side, so it's puzzling why it breaks off in the middle.

 > Conversation logs. A list of what the user typed into the chat and what the bot responded to.
 Where is this "log" located?
on the [nishio.icon] server.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "server" is that "server"?
[nishio.icon]Receive a string on Heroku and return a reply response. The status is stored in Firestore.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "save" is that "save"?
The [nishio.icon] talk ID is used as the key for the KVS, and the internal state necessary to continue the conversation is converted to JSON and stored there. JSON is the historical background, and when actually used, it is necessary to convert it into a form that can be entered into Firestore before it is saved.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
I would like to see the [nishio.icon] bug worked out. Losing logs is a loss, and I can't use it with confidence if I think it might be lost. I've tried a few quick and suspicious operations, but I can't reproduce them, and I'm having a hard time keeping my head above water.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "log"?
[nishio.icon]Firestoreにある。

 What does this "log" look like?
[nishio.icon] file to be appended. If the log disappears, I wonder if it was overwritten, but it is inexplicable that it disappears because it should have been loaded, added, and written back in the first place.
[nisbot.icon]Where does that "log" come from?
[nishio.icon]Let's see, the feature that I think is suspicious this time is the "open and continue past conversations" feature that I recently added, and I was using it all the time when the logs actually disappeared. When I used this feature, I first accessed Firestore with the conversation ID in the browser's IndexedDB to retrieve the past logs and display them.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its "log"?
I'll send [nishio.icon]Firestore the conversation ID and say, "Give me the log of this conversation.
[nisbot.icon]What do you hope will happen regarding that "log"?
I wish [nishio.icon] would not disappear, or at least know how to reproduce the phenomenon of disappearing. If you can't reproduce it, you can't debug.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "log" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]I don't know!
[nisbot.icon]
 > I'll send the conversation ID to Firestore and say, "Give me the log of this conversation."
 What kind of "Firestore" is this "Firestore"?
[nishio.icon] KVS on just a server
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "server"?
I have a script that downloads the values on the [nishio.icon] server locally to make it easier to investigate, and I did see that the beginning of the log in question was broken using that, but then a few other things were downloaded. I should also see what kind of data those are.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its a "server"?
That's the best way to know what's going on with the [nishio.icon] server.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "server" located?
[nishio.icon]I'm going to go observe a local copy.
[nisbot.icon]
 > That's the best way to know what's going on with the servers.
 What do you hope will happen regarding this "server"?
[nishio.icon]Okay, the log isn't gone, it's split into two conversations.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "conversation" is that "conversation"?
[nishio.icon] In other words, I thought I was having one conversation, but some kind of malfunction or something had started a new conversation in the middle of the first one.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "conversation"?
[nishio.icon]I just looked at the list of past conversations saved in my browser, and there were indeed two conversations. I didn't notice that, and displayed the log at the time the second conversation ended, so only the log of the second half of the conversation was displayed, and I mistakenly thought, "The first half was lost? I guess I misunderstood. I could see the log of the first half without any problem.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its a "conversation"?
[nishio.icon]It's a good thing we added a list of past conversations feature. You can see it there.
[nisbot.icon]What does that "conversation" look like?
[nishio.icon]Unlike verbal conversations, which can be lost, I think it's important to keep a log and be able to read it back later. So it's a written image. That's why I was so impatient, "The log is gone? but I am relieved to know that it has not disappeared for the time being.
