Include yourself in the "should"?
It developed when we were talking about [not to do].
　Whether "[should]" is used for "a set that includes you" or not
　　Example
　　　The case of the uncle who says, "Women should wear makeup."
　　　A case of a woman in full make-up saying, "Women should wear make-up.
　　　　I make up" first, and then an explanation of the motive for doing so.

　　　If a person who says, "All people should continue to learn," does not learn, then [he or she] is a [word or deed].
　　　　People who say "should" to subjects that don't include them are shirking their responsibility to act.
　　　　Like you're hitting people from a safe zone?
　　　　"A student's true duty is to study!" The uncle who insists

　　　Poor people who insist that "rich people should donate more."
　　　　Rich people who insist that "rich people should donate more money" and then donate themselves become "I see, you're [wittily] doing it."
