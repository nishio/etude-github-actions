Intellectual exploration begins with admitting that you don't know.
>[https://twitter.com/sugimoto_kei/status/1601836249412562944?s=20&t=k3FeEzQHmB_PX8ApR-ji8A @sugimoto_kei]: Maybe today, [knowledge] is too much tied to [social hierarchy]. I don't understand. So, to frankly say "[I don't understand]" about something important is taken as a statement of [weakness]/[incompetence]. By the person more than by anyone else.
>This is not an intellectual attitude. Intellectual inquiry starts from [admitting that you don't know what you don't know].

It's lame that people who think the amount of knowledge is a social pecking order don't realize that [computers are overwhelming].
