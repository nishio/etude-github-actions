To be the first is excellence
Being the first is [excellence].

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]

Being the first of its kind is excellence.
lxiii 

To be the first of its kind is to excel, and to excel in that regard is to excel in a double sense. If the players are the same, being the first is a great advantage. Many would have been veritable funnicks had they been the first of their kind. Those who came first were heirs to fame, while the rest were little more than a little brother's allowance. No matter what he did, he could never convince the world that he was more than a parrot. The prodigy's skill may open up new avenues, but the way to do so is prudent. The wise man, by the novelty of his undertakings, will have his name noted in the golden rule of heroes. Some prefer to be first in unimportant things than to be second in great exploits.
