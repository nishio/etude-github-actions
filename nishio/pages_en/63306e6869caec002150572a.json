　Instructions for inpaint and img2img [diary 2022-09-21#632b0b13aff09e0000a6378b].
　　In this regard, img2img's multiple-image generation can be specified with a command line argument, so it might be a good idea to use that.
　　Inconveniences include
　　　ID and placement is different from the normal generation process.
　　　　I'd like to at least share the same ID.
　　　Normal generation process is paused before generation, want to resume after generation
　　　　Is SIGCONT correct?
　　About inpaint
　　　I want to be able to experiment at hand.
　　　Experimental: The mask should be a gradient in the first place.
　　　It is easier to create the mask image itself by looking at the differences in the program.
　　　　Prepare the original image and the image painted with a semi-transparent marker, and mask the areas where differences exist.
　　　Can't I just make the outside of the mask of what came out after ✅ generation original? Do the borders stand out?

NFT was interesting to me because it was unknown to me and I was tinkering around with it, but once again, when I think about how to get AI to earn its own maintenance, it needs to be something stable like fan club dues, not something uncertain like NFT....
