Total book content
>What is the [task completion condition] of reading? Understanding cannot be a completion condition. For example, you may set a goal such as "I will understand 100% of this book," but this is not an appropriate completion condition. This is not an appropriate completion condition because you do not know the total amount of "what is in the book," so you cannot determine on your own whether you have understood 100% of the book.

I thought this was a slightly misleading expression, because if you interpret "the total amount of what is written in this book" literally, you can know the total amount by the number of words written or something.
I would say that "the total amount of concepts the author intended to convey by writing the book" can only be determined by someone who understands all that is in the book.
Well, hold off for a moment.

you do not know the total amount of what the author wants to tell

if we make A to B
