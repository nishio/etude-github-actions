monopoly
[Management game.] The player rolls the dice in a backgammon-like manner to advance the board, and can buy real estate in the squares where the dice stop. By buying up land of the same color, the rent doubles, and furthermore, by investing in a hotel or other facilities on top of it, the rent goes up and up and up. A similar concept was later developed in the famous "Momotaro Dentetsu" (Momotaro Electric Railroad).

If you cannot pay the rent, you can borrow money from the bank by first mortgaging the land. If that is no longer possible, sell the property.

Because it is an analog game, unlike Momotaro Dentetsu, it allows for free negotiation. Land exchange is an obvious example, but it is possible to take land in exchange for rent, or to make a contract that exempts you from paying rent.

Games where you can learn about economies of scale through monopoly, capital investment, liquidity of cash, and negotiating with other parties to understand their needs.
