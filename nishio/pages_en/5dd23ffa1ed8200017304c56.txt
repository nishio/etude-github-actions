	In addition to cases where the action is defined in advance as "this is the job," there are other cases where it becomes [a job] [after the fact].
	In order to establish preliminary work, it is necessary to verbalize and communicate in advance what the work is
	Are after-the-fact jobs hard to match with [permanent employment]?
		It would be better if there was no [no side job rule].
	It would be easier to create jobs after the fact in the form of a [basic income] than to hire full-time employees.
		It is only possible with the assumption that people have a [spontaneous job creation] mindset.
