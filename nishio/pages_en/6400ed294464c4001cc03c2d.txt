All data is a lie
> All [data] is [a lie]. [* Use the data knowing it to be a lie. And from that, we can determine the more correct truth. That is the path to [judgment]. But how can the truth be derived from a lie? It is because, from a different point of view, all data also contain some semblance of [the truth]. ([KJ method: Let the chaos speak for itself] p.71)
