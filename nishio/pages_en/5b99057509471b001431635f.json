People who have no second chances if they fail.
I saw someone respond to a statement like, "If you don't start, you don't start," by saying, "If you fail, there's no end in sight."

 When there is really no end in sight if you fail
  I'm sorry for your loss.
  Do your best not to fail.
  I don't know if it would do any good if it didn't fail.
 When you just assume, "If I fail, there's no end in sight."
  This case is more common.
  We need to act, fail, and realize that it's surprisingly okay.
  But the person's own assumptions get in the way of action.

[Why taking risks pays off.]
