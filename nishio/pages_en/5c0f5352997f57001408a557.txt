ferrite
>Ferrite is a general term for ceramics based on iron oxide. Most ferrites are ferromagnetic and are widely used as magnetic materials. Those that exhibit soft magnetic properties are called "soft ferrites" and those that exhibit hard magnetic properties are called "hard ferrites. Invented by Yogoro Kato and Takeshi Takei at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

	soft ferrite
		>Because of its high magnetic permeability and high electrical resistance, eddy current loss in the high-frequency range is small, it is used as the magnetic core material of inductors and transformers for high-frequency applications.
	hard ferrite
 	So-called ferrite [magnets].
