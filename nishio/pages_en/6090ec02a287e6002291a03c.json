 *1258679835*[Kaizen] Constant wake-up time
 I've been getting up at the same time on weekends as on weekdays in order to kaizen my health problems lately, but even though I was up late yesterday, I woke up at the usual time and felt surprisingly refreshed. Was it the deep sleep? I feel as refreshed as I do after a lot of exercise, an early night, and a lot of sleep. Even though I didn't exercise. I just did some leg stretches while looking at the internet, was that good? Or did my body learn to wake up at the same time by being up at the same time including holidays?
 
 It rained yesterday, so there's no "I got some sun the day before, so my rhythm is not so good. I haven't been exercising as much as I should.
 
 By the way, "I wake up at the same time on my days off" means "my alarm goes off at the same time on my days off as on weekdays, I open the curtains, turn on the light, and go back to sleep. When I make the light brighter, my body seems to think, "Oh, it's time to get up," and I wake up in about an hour.
 
 *1258689247*iPhoneで英語podcastを聞く
 My iPod was acting weird and for some reason the volume was low only for podcasts, so I moved it to my iPhone to isolate the problem, but it is highly functional with some sort of 30-second undo button and double-speed playback function. What should I do with my iPod?
