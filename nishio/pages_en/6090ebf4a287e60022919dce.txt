 *1200877188* Oh shit.
 ↓I was reading and implementing this kind of thing and time was running out.
 
 Slashdot Japan | Fast search by treating all data as file names?
 http://slashdot.jp/article.pl?sid=08/01/20/2052246
 
 *1200877575* for now.
 I put 1.1 million data in a Python dictionary and checked how many tens of seconds it would take to retrieve one random item from it.
 
 >|python|
 >>> from random import random
 >>> from time import clock
 >>> data = dict((str(i), random()) for i in range(1100000))
 >>> t = clock(); print "select:", data[str(int(random()*1100000))]; print clock() - t, "sec"
 select: 0.692766546604
 0.0483114474047 sec
 ||<
 
 About 0.05 seconds. I'll find out how long it takes with on-memory SQLite later.
 
 -----
 PS
 Code that tastes through all 1.1 million data and outputs the value of another column in the row such that one particular column matches the condition.
 
 >|python|
 >>> def foo():
 	t = clock()
 	for k in data.keys():
 		if k == "110001":
 			print "select where", data[k]
 	print clock() - t, "sec"
 
 	
 >>> foo()
 select where 0.895431963644
 0.860433099738 sec

 I can't judge whether the proposed method is fast or slow without more detailed information on the amount of data used in the experiment.

 The in-house ads on the Hanzomon Line are dominated by "Koream". I wonder what it is. It doesn't give any details, but says to search for it. Is it a medicine for constipation?
 
 *1200888986*I created Scheme in Python.
 After being kicked out of the after-party drinking venue for the <a href="http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:1">1000 Speakers Conference</a>, I somehow returned to Cybozu Labs for the third meeting.
 
 For some reason, yukoba started to make Scheme, and amachang also said "let's make it"! Then they said, "Let's make it a hackathon anyway! No, I can't go home if I start doing that! Ah, but if I don't write it now, I may never write it! But if I don't write it now, I may never write it!
 
 So here is what I wrote.
 <a href="http://ja.doukaku.org/comment/5414/">How do you write it? org 5414 Nishio: I made this in 5 hours after a drinking session, so it's pretty... (Scheme-like implementation) - post details</a>.
 
 Here is what the other two wrote.

 Since I'm here, I'll try to write something to convey the atmosphere of the hackathon.

 Now, since foofoo is global and cannot be referenced, define is not global.

 Someone say, "What's going on with the tokenizer?"

 nishio "Gee, I thought lambda was not working properly, but there was a bug in the tokenizer.
 After all this delay, I finally get lambda working.
 
 I implemented "let" first while yukoba tries to implement "let" by converting to lambda.
 
 Code review. amachang "I don't think this closure is done?" nishio "It doesn't look like it's done...write a test code and write it".

 YUKOBA "Become undef! Why?
 nishio "Isn't that just a define being executed instead of an implicit begin when there are multiple expressions?
 
 After this I was hungry and went outside to eat. Not a single restaurant was open! After some twists and turns, we found Sukiya.
 I'm talking in Sukiya and it turns out that my implementation is not about Fibonacci in the first place.
 amachang and yukoba are going home by cab. I was at the opposite end of the Hanzomon line, so it was a very long way!
 Return to the lab to check the behavior of the scope.
 
 nishio
 >||
 gosh> (define f (let ((x 1)) (lambda () y)))
 f
 gosh> (let ((y 2)) (f))
 *** ERROR: unbound variable: y
 Heh, this is how it goes.
 ||<
 
 I'll fix what was poked at, I just made the lambda have a scope object.
 Also, it seems that setq is not written in the current scope, but is written after tracing back to the point where it was defined, so it is implemented that way.
 Finish implementing comparison functions and such for Fibonacci.
 
 -----
 
 I haven't implemented Scheme macros or continuations yet, but I don't know what to do because I've never written a Scheme program with macros or continuations in the first place.
 I wondered if I would be beaten if I published a Scheme without macros by saying "I made a Scheme"... and amachang said to me, "What are you doing, not publishing a Scheme for fear of being beaten by the organizer of the 1000 speaker project? I was encouraged, so I made it public. I've published it.
 
 -----
 
 I'm faintly hoping that id:higepon will pick it up hard.
 
 summary of a joke
 "make it a cons list or you'll cry later", "implementing classical macros is easy", "eh, don't optimize the tail call (straw)"
 When amachang said that his code could easily implement classical macros, and when he did it, I wanted to do it too, so we made an "agreement not to do it during work hours" w
 Personally, I would like to support the cons list where the list is cons list and the dot list.

 Wait, I don't think I can win.
 I was going to take it easy on Scheme and rework it, but it's been a cataclysm.
 
 **1200900037*Find a non-smoking restaurant.
 I wrote on the lab's message board, "I wonder if there's a gourmet map that shows the degree of smoke separation..." and was promptly informed.

 *1200902501* I want to be able to use ActionScript.
 Because out of the three of us in the <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/amachang/20080120/1200850505">Scheme Hackathon</a>, only my implementation doesn't work in the browser! (><)
 
 By the way, there seems to be a slight misunderstanding...
 http://www.mogya.com/blog/2008/01/1000.html
 >>
 I had a brief conversation with NISHIO-san during the drinking session.
 I thought, "Python is getting a lot of users, so maybe it's time to move on to another language.
 
 Personally, I thought that language was a tool and that I should choose the best one to create what I want to create (so the increase in the number of users is not a problem), so this statement came as a great shock to me.
 I see," he said, "you can make most things in any language." I thought, "I see, this is the kind of person who drives straight ahead on the freeway.
 <<
 
 I completely agree with the statement "Languages are tools, choose the best one for what you want to create. I have no intention of abandoning Python.
 However, the fact that the Python population is growing faster and faster means that if I just continue to use Python as I have in the past, my commercial value is going to decrease rapidly, and I have to either increase what I can do in Python faster than the rate at which the Python population is growing, or pioneer other languages. I have to do one of two things. I wanted to say that I feel the former is going to be difficult, and that it is time to explore other languages. So, for now, my current target is ActionScript.
 
 At first, I read <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/koyachi/20070327/1174989643">Using actionscript-mode.el for AS3 - koyachi's diary</a> carefully and configured cc-mode, as- config and other settings. I also changed the definition of yellow in actionscript-mode to a darker color.
 
 *1200930897* just got back.
 On the train home, I was able to sit down in Shinbashi, so I implemented a kind of macro.
 
 >|python|
 def test():
     e(parse("""
     (begin
     (define-macro unless (cond body)
         (if cond () body))
     (display (unless 0 1))
     (display (unless 2 3))
     )"""))
 ||<
 
 This will show 1 and []. The reason the empty list is [] instead of () is because we are still using Python lists.
 
 - It'll be right before the last train.
 - If you walk to Nagatacho, you definitely won't make it.
 - I'm going to Tameike Sanno station, but it's not one, so I don't know if it's the last train or not.
 - Search in the transfer guide and select the Ginza Line
 - I can sit down at Shinbashi. There are four stops to Mitsukoshimae, where I plan to transfer, so I'll get out my notebook to implement the macro.
 - Mitsukoshimae, a nice place, so I decide to ride to Asakusa.
 - Macro ready.
 - I arrived at Asakusa. Which way is home?
 - I arrived home; it took me half an hour.
 
 Asakusa - home is not a distance I can walk. It's not like I have to walk to work every day. When there is no last train, going back to Asakusa is an option.

 Above.
 >|scheme|
 (define-macro unless (cond body)
         (if cond () body))
 ||<
 is not correct grammar. The correct answer is
 >|scheme|
 (define-macro (unless cond body)
         (if cond () body))
 ||<
 But since this correction can be done in a minute, I'll just say that "any mistakes that exist on this site, intended or unintended, are either exercises or jokes for the reader." I'll just say that it was an exercise in
