I like it inside the micra.
It's done.

structure
　button, the command block executes `webhooks execute post-like x` (the x part is an arbitrary name)
　[SimpleWebhooks] が `http://localhost:5000/`に名前をPOST
　Flask running on localhost receives request and executes command with [RCON
		`command = f"data get storage likes {name}"`
		　Get the number of likes from [storage
		　increase by one
		`command = f"data modify storage likes {name} set value {value}"`
		　Write the increased value to storage
		`command = f"hd setLine likes_{name} 1 LIKE: {value}"`
　　　[Holographic Displays]を更新
　　　Assuming the name of the HD is in the form `likes_x`.


　code:SimpleWebhooks/config.yaml
  post-like:
    url: http://localhost:5000/
    json:
      name: "{COMMAND_PARAM_1}"

code:server.py
 from flask import Flask, request
 from aiomcrcon import Client
 import asyncio
 import re
 import threading
 from secret import PASSWORD, HOST, PORT
 
 app = Flask(__name__)
 client = Client(HOST, PORT, PASSWORD)
 
 
 def create_app():
     return app
 
 
 async def update_likes(name):
     await client.connect()
 
     command = f"data get storage likes {name}"
     response = await client.send_cmd(command)
     if "Found no elements matching" in response[0]:
         value = 0
     else:
         value = int(re.search("\d+", response[0]).group())
 
     value += 1
     command = f"data modify storage likes {name} set value {value}"
     response = await client.send_cmd(command)
 
     command = f"hd setLine likes_{name} 1 LIKE: {value}"
     response = await client.send_cmd(command)
     
     await client.close()
 
 
 @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
 def root():
     if request.method == "GET":
         return "OK"
     else:
         name = request.json["name"]
 
     x = threading.Thread(target=lambda: asyncio.run(update_likes(name)), args=()).start()
     return "OK"

place to get stuck in
　Need to return OK before executing RCON against webhook
　　Sending a RCON packet but it is not executed and times out
　　Perhaps the webhook command is grabbing a lock.
　　So I decided to create a form of thread.
