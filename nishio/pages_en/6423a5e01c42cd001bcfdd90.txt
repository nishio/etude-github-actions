What you choose to invest your time in from the many ideas is what moves you.
>[taisukeOo https://twitter.com/taisukeOo/status/1640665872154128385] I would like to see IPA Unexplored, Unexplored Junior, or some other event held at this GPT4 timing, and I think it should be done. I think that the people involved should express their thoughts here. I think it would be a good idea to have some kind of event like IPA Unexplored or Unexplored Junior at the timing of this GPT4.

However, I think the latter is definitely better than "a proposal that is just an idea" and "a proposal that has been improved based on the findings of trying out a prototype".

I believe that the point of which one of the many ideas you selected [invested your time] to create a [prototype] will ensure [scarcity] and [move people's hearts].
