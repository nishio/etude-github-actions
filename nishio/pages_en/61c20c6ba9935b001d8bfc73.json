This was interesting too.
　[Not a hoax, but incorrect. The theory that "90% want to get married" is a lie (Kazuhisa Arakawa) - Personal - Yahoo! News https://news.yahoo.co.jp/byline/arakawakazuhisa/20210821-00254254]
　That 90% of the respondents chose the former in a question where the choice was either "I plan to get married eventually" or "I don't plan to get married forever".
　In the following question, "I want to get married within a year," "I would marry my ideal partner," and "I have no intention of getting married yet," 40-50% of the respondents chose "I have no intention of getting married yet.
　　[nishio.icon]I wonder what they were thinking when they chose this question in the first place.
