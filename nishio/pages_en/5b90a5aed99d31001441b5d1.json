Shortcut key to neologd.normalize
[https://gyazo.com/9bba62eb9f34296ae3919ef88debd277]
Create a service like this in Automator and assign shortcut keys from the keyboard settings

/usr/local/bin/python3 -c "import nelogdn, sys; sys.stdout.write(neologdn.normalize(sys.stdin.read()))"

Assuming that [neologdn] has been installed in python3 in advance.
