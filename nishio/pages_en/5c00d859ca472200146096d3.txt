Not confident" is overconfident.
On 2012-11-10 [blog post http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20121110/1352558205] was mentioned on Twitter 6 years later ([Social Trigger]), so I went back to read it again and found it still useful I thought it was still useful ([Test of Time]), so I reprinted it.
The manuscript I'm talking about here that "needs to be written" is [the technology behind the coding].

I was reading the book "[The Heart is a Disease] - Useful Early Buddhist Dharma Talks <2>" as an escape from reality while saying, "I have to write a manuscript. If you want to know the exact words, you should read about 3 pages from p.60.

 The reason people lose confidence is that they have too much confidence.
 When one thinks he or she can finish this level of work in a jiffy, but it doesn't work out when he or she actually does it, one loses confidence.
 You think, "I'm going to give an outstanding speech," and then you actually don't speak well, and you lose confidence.
 The delusional self is too wonderful to be true, so it tries to behave the way its "delusional wonderful self" behaves and suffers because it can't.
 The reason you say, "I'm not confident in my work," is because you have delusions in your head of miraculous success. You can only do what you can do in reality. You can only do what you can do. Aim for a state in which you feel that you have done your best.

After all, I had too much confidence in myself and had a [false self-image] that I could write smoothly if I wanted to. However, when I actually started writing, I struggled and could not finish in the scheduled time. And in order to distract themselves from this "inconvenient truth," they unconsciously avoid writing itself. This is the mechanism of so-called "[escape from reality].

It seems that early [Buddhism] has a life-hack aspect of how to control these "bad feelings". Interesting.
