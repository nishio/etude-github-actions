end-to-end memory networks
Sukhbaatar, S., Weston, J., & Fergus, R. (2015). End-to-end memory networks. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 2440-2448).
The input sentence [$ x_i] is embedded with the sum of the embedded representations of each word
[$ m_i = \sum_j Ax_{ij}]
The question text q is embedded as well
[$ u = \sum_j Bq_j]
The importance p of each of the N stored information to u is the soft max of the inner product
[$ p_i = \mathrm{softmax}(u \cdot m_i)]
[$ o= p \cdot \sum_j Cx_{ij}]
In short [soft attention mechanism].
[$ \hat{a} = \mathrm{softmax} (W(o+u))]
Is such a design acceptable in many ways? However, the constraint that the entire system must be differentiable in order to optimize end-to-end is severe.
