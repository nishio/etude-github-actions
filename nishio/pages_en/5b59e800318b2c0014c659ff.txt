1.5 Level Table of Contents Digest
In placing the table of contents of [Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers] in [Scrapbox], we want to [link] keywords to make effective use of Scrapbox's functions.
However, putting the entire table of contents on one page would have 307 lines, so the links would be cluttered.
Then I thought of dividing it into chapters, but the table of contents for one chapter alone has 70 lines. I want to make it more detailed.
That's when I realized, it's a "[top-down]" division, whether you divide it by chapter or by section.
I thought we talked in Chapter 5 about the importance of sticking together [bottom-up].
Therefore, I looked at the end headings, attached them, terminated them in an amount that was not too long, and made a new [nameplate] without being bound by the "current headings" (i.e., [a framework created in the past]). This is like the KJ method.
