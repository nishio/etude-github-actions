Specialist Translation Strategies
 Let T be the [Technology Portfolio] vector of [Specialist].
 Customers cannot directly observe t
  Comprehension issues
  Differences in values
 Customer observes O = f(T) multiplied by the [presentation] function f
 The inner product of this observation and the customer's [value] vector V is the value that the customer perceives C
 	[$ C = f(T) \cdot V]
 f can be changed to suit the customer.
 	This [translation] capability raises the expectation of value perceived by the customer.
