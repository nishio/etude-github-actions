Slow Search
	[Search] implicitly assumes that a human puts in a query and gets immediate results back.
	Longer time between human input and return of results can be a beneficial feature

			Register keywords and be notified when news containing those keywords is published.
			If you tell the system your "preferences," it will [recommend] news articles that may be of interest to you.

	Seems like a good idea to remove the [constraint] of reaction time.
