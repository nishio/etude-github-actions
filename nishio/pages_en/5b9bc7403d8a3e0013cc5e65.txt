	Satrale (brand-name beer)
	[Amazon https://amzn.to/2zKWA01]
	A disease that makes people around you realize your thoughts even if you don't say them out loud.
	If the person realizes that he or she is a satrale, it will break his or her heart, so it is necessary to prevent him or her from realizing it.
	　For example, if two satrarei approach each other within a certain distance, the thought "I'm a satrarei" of one will be transmitted to the other.
　I know that satrare exists, but I don't know that I am it.
