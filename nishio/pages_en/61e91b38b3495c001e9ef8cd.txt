(6.2.3.1) draw a picture
To approach a physical sensation, you can try to draw a picture.

I asked multiple designers to draw a picture of creativity. Of course, "creativity" is an abstraction concept. Moreover, since it does not have a physical form, you can not see it and imitate it. To draw it, we need to "see" creativity. It is work to bring an abstract concept closer to a physical sensation.

I introduce some of the pictures.

The following figure is comparing creativity to plants. In the head, it sprout from a seed. Then it grows big and makes fruits.

The following another figure made me aware of my blind spot. When I started this experiment, I was thinking only about personal creativity. The designer who drew this picture thought that creativity is like nuclear fusion occurring in teams of multiple people.
