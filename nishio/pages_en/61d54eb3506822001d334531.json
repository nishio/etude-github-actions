[The next step is to get the "hazy" out].
In the context of the [SECI model
	Keichobot helps to put subjective mumbo-jumbo into words = helps tacit knowledge to be expressed as formal knowledge
	Kozaneba helps discover connections and structures between written text fragments = helps linkage between formal knowledge
		Personally, I think it also helps me understand texts that are difficult to comprehend = helps me internalize formal knowledge.

I'd like to solve this but I don't have time so I'll just make a note of it.
　Is the relationship between "living" and "thinking" in [Building, Living, Thinking] related to the grouping process in [Mind Palace], [Clean Space] and the KJ method?
　Are the tools in [Tools for Conviviality] relevant to groupware and metaverse?
　　→The word [conviviality] is a type of concept that should not be interpreted from the letter of the translation.
　In the [SECI Spiral] of [Knowledge Creation Company], [collaboration] is depicted as if it were an essential part of the spiral.
　　It is good that there are two ways of communicating felt sense: a non-verbal collaboration and a verbal one.
　　I'm not sure there is any reason to assume that this would happen alternately.
