Jigsaw Puzzle Parable
You can only have one jigsaw piece at a time.
If you try to treat all the pieces equally, you will make no progress.
#TaskManagement

When there is more than one person, try to give everyone something equally.
And they can't give you much because of the binding "it has to be [equal]".
Because the [small-start] means of "first give to a few" are blocked.
