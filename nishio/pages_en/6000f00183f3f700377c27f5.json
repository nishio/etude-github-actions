X is not available.
Suppose Mr. A says, "X is not available."
Is it universally "X is useless"?
　If so, then the perception that "X is not available" would be shared.
　Unless you have a very limited opportunity to try out X to see if you can use it.
There are those who can use X and those who cannot, and Mr. A is the latter.

'Available' is [an attribute of a relationship, not a stand-alone attribute].
　Relationship between tools and users, challenges and solutions
　Only "usable" when well matched.
