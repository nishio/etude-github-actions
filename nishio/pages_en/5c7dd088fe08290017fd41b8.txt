Two Generations of Manufacturing
> 1st Generation: to do it all on your own, so you can learn all the skills and gain [total sensation].
> Second Generation: Riding on the [division of labor] rails laid down by the first generation, they can acquire a high level of [expertise].

Even as the second generation refines its expertise, there is not the same holistic experience at the end of that rail as there was for the first generation.

>The first generation only talks to other first generations, and as a result, the [network] between first generations is strengthened and further strengthened by connecting with first generations in other industries, so you'll notice a big difference in the results.
