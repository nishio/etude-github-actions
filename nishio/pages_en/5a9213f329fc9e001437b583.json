Export Law App.
 I want to make an application for [export method
 [Scrapbox Export Tool]
 If I make a Facebook app style export application, I can remove the icons, names, likes, etc. since I'm the only one writing. Should the time be out or not? Is it better without?

 The problem with the Facebook export method is that it's not easy to see what you exported yesterday.
  It would be nice to be able to switch easily by swiping left/right or something.

 Drooling is fine while traveling on the train, but drooling on Facebook until you get to the office is a problem that doesn't feel right.
 I really should have worked on separating what is a task and what is a project after hanging it up here.
