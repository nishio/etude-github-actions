mouthwash
Put about 5 drops in a glass and dilute with water.
My wife, who doesn't like alcohol or mint stimulants, bought it and recommended I use it.
At first he said, "It's a hassle, I have some diluted mouthwash left over, so I'll use that," but after trying it out, he started using only this one.
　The original diluted ones are irritating with lots of alcohol and other chemicals to keep them from spoiling. I assumed that's what mouthwash was for.
　Concour F also contains alcohol, but it is diluted so it is less irritating. It is about the same as dark green tea.
　　Oh, you're thinking of green tea because it contains green tea extract in the first place.
　　　>Contains green tea extract and l-menthol as taste masking agents.

I first tried using it before bed.
　The effect is obvious, what we used to use in the past.
　Is it a matter of [selling without advertising]?
I started using it to rinse my mouth out when I get up from bed.
I also started rinsing after eating.
