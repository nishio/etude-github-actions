 *1337089678* What we want to create: a low-cost way to play Geister.
 I want to play Geister with id:Yoshiori. What is the lowest cost way?
 
 I had thought about making a web app so that I could play remotely, but I didn't want to spend too much money because I might get bored quickly.
 
 If we trust each other not to lie, can we play it by exchanging something like "B's 3 forward", "I'll go forward and take it", or "It was red" in a chat?
