Dominion: Difference between improvement and reconstruction
Improvements discarded at [cantrip], just +1 cost card gain
Reconstruction is discarded by [terminal action], up to +2 cost card gain.

The renovation is +2, so the gold can be made into a genus state or a curse into a 2-cost action.
Improvements cannot be made because you get "just +1" card.
The reconstruction can be [empty disposal], which acquires the same card as the one that was discarded, for example, to wither a pile.

The improvement is a cantrip, so it is easy to include multiple copies, but without a convenient conversion target, it is subtle.
