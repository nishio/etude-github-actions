The desire for what you seek but cannot get
The suffering caused by the desire to seek what cannot be obtained even if one seeks it is called "suffering from wanting and not obtaining.

Is there no name attached to the side of greed?

There is a different kind of stupidity in asking for something that you might get and being disappointed when you don't get it, compared to asking for something that "wouldn't have gotten it in the first place" and suffering when you don't get it.
