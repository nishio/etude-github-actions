 *1207268887*Train spacing
 I heard that if I miss the 9:27 train, the next one will be at 10:46. And it is now 9:26. Aaaaah.
 
 *1207272886*gya
 
 No time, no battery.
 
 *1207276766* Development camp
 Now Sakura.
 
 I wonder how easy it would be to create a program that communicates with the server using ActionScript, including the server-side program. If it is just a static file delivery, it would be easy to do it all with Rascat alone.
 
 *1207278472*JR Narita Line
 Shaking.
 Intoxication.
 
 I also found out that I seem to have left my digital camera battery in the car after charging and installing it.
 
 I was thinking of trying HDR for a break from development.
 
 *1207278538* It's peaceful.
 It is a tambo in the distance.
 
 Stop looking at the screen.
 I decided to be pampered by looking at the rice paddies.
 
 *1207279032*The Kanto Plain is amazing!
 Flat.
 
 You can't see the Ikoma Mountains or anything like that in the distance.

 I can't use Suica...

 *1207286206*86 Development camp
 Three rooms for about 10 people.
 
 What is this atmosphere like a high school excursion? I said, "It's impossible for everyone to have a laptop computer on a school trip.
 
 It is a fairly spacious and clean ryokan, with 24-hour access to hot springs, microwaves, and hot water. You can also rent a conference room. Except for the distance, it is a good venue.
 
 Lunch was curry.
 
 I don't like VMs" (Ueno).

 It was a hassle to remove all the lids, so I just took one off and went in. Interesting.
 
 - An earthquake is coming.
 - Write "Earthquake is coming!" on IRC.
 - I don't want to be the same as everyone else because everyone else is writing, so I write "I myself came
 - "The white meat is here!" by Ueno (via IRC)
 - And everyone was at ease as Mr. Ueno gave an endless explanation as to why he said, "The white meat is here.

 *1207292161*[Mac][Python] How to make sounds
 -Sound playback from the command line on a Mac | Weboo! Returns.
 --http://yamashita.dyndns.org/blog/play-sounds-with-python-on-mac/
 
 I saw this and made it.
 
 >|python|
 from AppKit import NSSound
 from time import sleep
 
 s = NSSound.alloc()
 filename = "/Users/nishio/tmp/mario-sound/jump.wav"
 s.initWithContentsOfFile_byReference_(filename, True)
 print s
 s.play()
 while s.isPlaying():
     sleep(0.1)
 
 s.stop()
 ||<
 
 Done, done. But when I call play on the NSSound object one more time after it has played once, no sound is heard. I can't find a method to rewind. Hmmm.
 
 >|python|
 def play(filename):
     s = NSSound.alloc()
     s.initWithContentsOfFile_byReference_(filename, True)
     print s
     s.play()
     while s.isPlaying():
         sleep(0.1)
         
     s.stop()
     s.dealloc()
 
 filename = "/Users/nishio/tmp/mario-sound/jump.wav"
 
 for i in range(10):
     play(filename)
 
 ||<
 
 At any rate, it is possible to repeat the process by specifying the file name each time and doing an init, but I have a feeling that this is not the right way to do it.
 
 *1207312557* Relay standard input and standard output to child processes
 I wrote the code below and was testing it in sed but it doesn't work.
 
 >|python|
 import sys
 from subprocess import *
 from time import sleep
 
 cmd = sys.argv[1:]
 bufsize = 1
 p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stdin=PIPE, bufsize=bufsize)
 
 while True:
     sleep(0.1)
     print 1
     data = sys.stdin.readline()
     print 2, repr(data)
     p.stdin.write(data)
     print 3
     data = p.stdout.readline()
     print 4
     sys.stdout.write(data)
 ||<
 
 It goes like this.
 
 >||
 $ python ~/tmp/watch_stdin.py "sed s/a/b/g"
 1
 aaa
 2 'aaa\n'
 3
 ||<
 
 In fact, when aaaÆŸn enters the standard input of the child process, the child process should return bbb on the standard output.
 
 >||
 $ sed s/a/b/g
 aaa
 bbb
 ||<
 
 I talked to frsyuki about this problem, and he told me that he had tried writing it in Ruby, but it still didn't work with sed, but cat would work.
 
 >||
 $ python ~/tmp/watch_stdin.py "cat"
 1
 aaa
 2 'aaa\n'
 3
 4
 aaa
 1
 ||<
 
 Really, it works fine. I have no choice but to read sed's implementation now.
 
 
 I'll put up a cleaned up version for now.
 >|python|
 import sys
 from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
 from time import sleep
 
 cmd = sys.argv[1:]
 bufsize = 1
 p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stdin=PIPE, bufsize=bufsize)
 
 while True:
     sleep(0.1)
     data = sys.stdin.readline()
     if not data: break
     p.stdin.write(data)
     data = p.stdout.readline()
     sys.stdout.write(data)
 ||<
