Budding Phase
>The budding phase is not manageable. You will have to put the information to bed and wait for ideas to sprout. If you don't have time to meet the deadline, you set a time limit and then proceed with the rest of the phase based on what has sprouted by that time limit.

This is a bit wordy, but I'm talking about the fact that it should be separated by time.
And if there's a deadline, it should be divided backwards for the phase of nurturing to that deadline,
If you don't have a deadline, you have to set one for yourself, or you will never get started because you may come up with a "better idea" at any time.
This corresponds to the P part of the PDCA cycle, and if you don't start the Do quickly, you won't have time to improve.

Given that, "If you don't have time to meet the deadline," is not appropriate.
It's important that "no matter how much time you spend, you never run out of possibilities to come up with something better."

Because it can't be measured by quantity.

It is.
