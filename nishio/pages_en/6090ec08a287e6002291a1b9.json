 GTD books (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4576082116/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=4576082116">GTD for Beginners Stress-Free Organizing</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4576101714/ref=as_li_ss_ tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4576101714">GTD Practice</a>). The first three parts of the book are as follows.
 
 Last time, I put as much as I could think of in my inbox and sorted it into two lists: the "next action" list (activity) and the "someday I will do it" list (ituka). As a result, ituka was a little over 300 lines long, but as I was organizing it at the cafe in the morning, I started to see that I was writing the same thing over and over again with different levels of detail, and I started to think, "Shouldn't this cohesive list be put somewhere else? I started to feel like, "Maybe I should put this cohesiveness somewhere else. On the other hand, there are tasks that I have put in the activity list but have not started even after a week and have been postponed. These tasks are too big to be described as a single activity. They should be expressed in a higher level "project".
 
 >>
 Next action → project → area → 1-2 years goal → 3-5 years vision...
 <<
 
 So I'm going to organize it in projects.howm and ref/ that I created last time. activity has one line, but what is this? What is the purpose of this? What do you think you will gain by doing this?
 
 >>
 Planning: WHY (purpose, image of results) → HOW (how to do it) brainstorming → organizing → deciding next actions (ACTIONS)
 
 WHY: Purpose, results. Why are you doing it? What are the benefits to be gained?
 GOAL: At what point is the project complete?
 →No GOAL? Isn't that a higher level concept, not a project?
 HOW: How exactly do we do this?
 (WHYHOW: Is this really the only way to get that benefit?)
 <<
 
 As I was organizing, I realized that "art" projects don't have a clear goal. There are several specific "make something" tasks in it. I made a mistake in recognizing this as a task. This is not a task. This is the goal of the project. So, "art," which is a bundle of projects, is a higher-level entity than a project. So let's leave it AREA. By the way, why do we need to do this? No, this is a hobby. If I don't need to do it, does that mean I don't have to do it? No, I want to do it. I mean, this is necessary to enrich my life. I see.
