[Scrapbox Best Practices]
Abbreviation: "[Expanding hit points]."

I thought of mentioning a certain "idea F" but don't know what page it is called.
Suppose you try link suggestions with keywords X and Y that seem to be related, but you cannot find them, and you find page A that describes them, e.g., by searching.

I recognized the act of adding keywords X and Y to this A page "so that they will be connected when I do the same thing in the future" as an "expansion of [the hit decision].
　I had been doing this unconsciously but had not named it before.
　As for the similarities in notation, I recognized it as "notation shaking" absorption.

　I first realized on 2022-02-12 that it was a hit-and-run expansion.

Occurred Phenomena
　On one page B, I tried to mention concept F.
　　I couldn't remember the phrase, though it is in Chapter 33 of Lao Tzu's Dao Te Ching, "What dies but does not die is longevity".
　I tried linking to "immortality," "die and be not destroyed," etc., but couldn't make the connection.
　"I will never die."
　I found it in a search because I remembered the word "corporeal" being included on the page.
　　This page itself is titled "Knowing what is enough".
　Subsequent additions.
