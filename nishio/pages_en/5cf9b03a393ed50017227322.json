Endless loop of bots in Slack
	Messages displayed in replies to Outgoing Webhooks in [Slack] also generate Outgoing Webhooks
		That's not the case at Mattermost.
	So [bots] that speak without trigger words are triggered by their own statements and speak again
	It appears to be limited to once per second, but that's not an essential solution.
	Outgoing Webhook statements will be usename to the slackbot, so just ignore them in that case.
