　[Working backwards from the goal]
　I can't think of much to write because I wrote it honestly, passed the test at hand in one shot, and submitted it AC.
　code:py
　 def main():
      N = int(input())
      SS = input().strip().decode('ascii')
      XS = input().strip().decode('ascii')
  
      goal = [0] * 7
      goal[0] = 1  # if 1 Taka win
  
      for i in reversed(range(N)):
          s = int(SS[i])
          prev_goal = []
          if XS[i] == "A":
              for prev in range(7):
                  if goal[(prev * 10 + s) % 7] == 0 or goal[(prev * 10) % 7] == 0:
                      prev_goal.append(0)
                  else:
                      prev_goal.append(1)
          else:  # "T" 
              for prev in range(7):
                  if goal[(prev * 10 + s) % 7] == 1 or goal[(prev * 10) % 7] == 1:
                      prev_goal.append(1)
                  else:
                      prev_goal.append(0)
          goal = prev_goal
  
      if goal[0] == 1:
