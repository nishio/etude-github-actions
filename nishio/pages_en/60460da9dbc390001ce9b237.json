It's not a one-on-one dialogue.
People who think "it's not good to continue without a response" perceive SNS as a one-on-one [dialogue], when in fact it is more like a [shared whiteboard] where anyone can write as many times as they want. If someone thinks a post is incorrect, it is more natural for the point to be repeated until it is corrected.

	>"I will continue even though you have not responded" is for the reference of other tweet readers. This is a public tweet, so of course I am not writing this with only one of you in mind.

I modified the wording a bit.
	before It is more natural that if a wrong post is not corrected, the point will be repeated until it is corrected.
	after If someone thinks the writing is incorrect, it is more natural for the point to be repeated until it is corrected.
	It is not a requirement that the first statement be incorrect.
