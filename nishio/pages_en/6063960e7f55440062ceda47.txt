prototype theory
>The idea is that the categories people actually have are not classical categories defined by necessary and sufficient conditions, but are characterized by typical cases and their similarity to them.... For example, the word "bird" evokes small flying animals such as crows and sparrows, while ostriches and penguins are out of the typical case.
[Prototype theory - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%83%88%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%97%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96]

>A certain [change in word meaning] can be described as a word sense that was once peripheral but is now used as the central sense. In this case, the prototype of the meaning of the word has moved from A to B. Changes in other areas, such as syntax and phonology, can also be approached from the perspective of prototypes.
> It should also be noted that prototypes are complementary to "#1961. [basic level category]". Prototypes are related to the ability or action of being able to recall the corresponding typical meaning or object of instruction when a word is given. On the other hand, basic-level categories are concerned with the ability to recall the corresponding typical word or action when given a certain meaning or object of instruction. The former is a semasiological perspective, while the latter is an onomasiological perspective.
