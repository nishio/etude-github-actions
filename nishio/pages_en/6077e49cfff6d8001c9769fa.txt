The Parable of the Cicada
As a result of my own mastery of [the parable of the summer cicada], when a cicada came into my room, I just went through with "wahaha, a cicada came in. However, when someone said, "It is unpleasant for cicadas to chirp in a room," I realized, "Even if it is impossible to stop cicadas from chirping in summer, we can certainly prevent them from chirping in a room," so I decided to kick out the cicadas that came in.
