Right to refuse to provide web services
If the human side has the right to decide whether or not to use a web service, but the web service does not have the right to decide whether or not to provide service to humans, the web service must provide service in a [slave] manner, no matter how it is treated by any human. This is a [humanitarian] problematic situation, and it is socially unjust to overlook this situation, so services should be given the right to screen users and refuse to provide services.

As a result, some people will not be able to receive services.
