 I also made an explanatory handbook (2 A4 pages). All that is left is to print one card image for the explanation and one for the card on cardboard and cut it out. I wonder if printing on cardboard can be done at Kinko's.
 
 
 And now it's that time again. The rhythm of my life is not quite as I would like it to be.

 I think you are free to insist on "no following without permission" or "no reading off mixi". But that doesn't mean that drunks at train stations can't say things like, "Hey, you guys, don't come within three meters of me without my permission! Say hello to me when you pass me!" There is no reason for us to defend their claim. But if there are drunks like that, I avoid them because it might be troublesome if I get involved with them.

 I printed on regular copy paper so it is flat. I will print on thick paper by the weekend!
