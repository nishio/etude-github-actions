  Fill in the blanks from the end
  If there's an empty space that's in contact with the edge, that length is the minimum required.
 　Count the number of blanks
 　Tip: If the longest blank is less than or equal to the sum of the blanks at both ends, then moving to fill in the blanks at both ends is sufficient.
