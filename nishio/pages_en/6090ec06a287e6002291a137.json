 *1295282954*I started Pomodoro.
 Since many people around me have been practicing it recently, I bought "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4048689525?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247& creative=7399&creativeASIN=4048689525">Agile Time Management: An Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique</a>" as many people around me have been practicing it recently.
 
 The most prominent feature is probably the use of a kitchen timer to focus for a certain amount of time by dividing the time, but well, this is nothing new for those who have always been interested in improving intellectual productivity. 1992 issue of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/ product/4478490074?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4478490074">Intellectual Productivity System DIPS )</a> The idea has been around for so long that it has been mentioned in the
 
 The book also contains various other techniques that have been well known for a long time.
 - Task review is important
 - Commitment to do is important.
 - PDCA cycle
 - Tasks that are too large must be divided
 - Estimating the time it will take to complete a task, and developing estimating skills by checking to see if the estimate was accurate.
 - If the task list gets too long, I lose motivation just by looking at it, I have to keep it short.
 Such as.
 
 But there is one person here who knows these things in his head, but has never been able to put them into practice! Because they say to divide tasks, but what kind of tasks are we supposed to divide and how are we supposed to divide them? What do you plan and what do you check?
 
 The nice thing about this book is that it takes these dead technologies and combines them into a package with low implementation costs. I took a quick look at it on the train on the way to work, adopted the "set a timer for 25 minutes" and actually used it at work. I'm going to use it again tomorrow, and I might as well write a review again after about two weeks, since it says not to customize it on your own for about two weeks and to get used to the pattern. I just started today, so I can't write too much about it.
 
 You mention why the activity of "reading while on the bus for 25 minutes" is so focused. I have thought about the same thing before. <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20100508/1273292108'>A Study on why on-train programming is so productive</a>. The book uses the term "timebox" to describe this. A chunk of time where you do only one activity for one goal = one pomodoro. So, even when you are not on the bus, you use a 25-minute timer to create these situations. Easy.
 
 But the important thing here is the rule, "If you don't concentrate for 25 minutes, destroy that pomodoro." It's common for me to start something else because of interruptions from others or my own distractions, but I'm usually not aware of it. In the Pomodoro I did today, I found myself saying, "Oh my God," and getting up to go to the bathroom when an unexpected and unresolved error occurred. I think I used to go to the bathroom every time I was in this situation. I was not aware of it. Normally, I would go to the bathroom here and get a cup of tea on the way home, but if I did that, this pomodoro would be "I failed to concentrate, so I'm going to discard it. Remembering this, I sat down and continued working until the timer went off.
 
 People are distracted by other things. As I write this, I'm feeling a little hungry, so I opened the bag of bread I bought for breakfast, and then I realized that I was about to ruin Pomodoro by being distracted, so I went back to writing the blog. I realized that I was about to ruin the Pomodoro by getting distracted, so I went back to writing the blog, and though the PDCA cycle comes up in the latter part of this article, I thought it would be useful to know how many times I could not concentrate on the Pomodoro that I had planned because of myself (internal interruptions), how many times it was destroyed because of interruptions from others, and how many times I actually thought I could complete the task because of the Pomodoro. How many times I could not concentrate on the task due to my own fault (internal interruptions), how many times the task was discarded due to interruptions from others, how many pomodoros I thought I could complete the task, and how many pomodoros it actually took. By adding up these values in 25-minute increments, you can understand your own productivity and link it to kaizen.
 
 The 25-minute alarm went off, and it was thanks to the 25-minute timer that I wrote this review article after coming home around 24:00 and feeling unmotivated, lazy, and ready to go to bed because I didn't feel like I could do anything productive. I'll make a note of the key words I missed and include them next time: periodic breaks/tasks to step away from the task and look at the big picture. Know your limits: if you work 8 hours a day, can you do 16 pomodoros a day? You will lose focus and get interrupted. That's okay.
