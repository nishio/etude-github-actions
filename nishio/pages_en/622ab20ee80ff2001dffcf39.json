People who think they know.
There are people who naturally accept that "there are things in the world that I don't know."
　When you feel something is not right, you naturally think, "Isn't the cause of this discomfort due to something I don't know?" I naturally think, "Is there something I don't know that is causing this discomfort?

Some people feel like they "know everything."
　Once in this state, it becomes difficult to get out.
　This is because even if other people know something that "person X who [thinks he/she] knows everything" does not know, he/she does not try to point it out to X.
