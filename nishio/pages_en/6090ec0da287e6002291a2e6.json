 *1393486908*I used word2vec to extract the two-sided words.
 I wrote a code to search for pairs of X and Y in word2vec distance, such that if you search for X, you get Y, and if you search for Y, you get X. The corpus is my Bookscan digital library, which is about 100MB. The corpus is my digitalized library with Bookscan, about 100MB. 66622 vocabulary words. When it's all done, I'll find out what percentage of the words are bilateral. I'm also thinking of putting it on Gist.

 With 66622 vocabulary words and O(N^2), it took me a total of 4 hours and 29 minutes. I was going to look for the pattern A-B+C=D in the future, but with O(N^4), it would take unrealistic time. 6303 words out of 66622 words were bilateral. About 10%.
