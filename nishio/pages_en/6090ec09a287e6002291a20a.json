 *1333180917*Diary to study Alloy (0)
 I will record the log of the study process about Alloy taught by id:warufuzaketaichi at Java-ja Onsen.
 
 I bought the textbook but haven't received it yet.

 I found a reference to it in Mr. Hiyama's blog, which I used as a reference when I was studying spheres, while googling Alloy. I found a reference to it in Mr. Hiyama's blog, which I referred to when I was studying spheres. Masayuki's Chimera Breeding</a>.
 
 Well, maybe I just think I understand because I can't explain how it was eye-opening ;p
 
 The explanation of <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/propella/20090712/p1'>Alloy: A Lightweight Object Modelling Notation - Language Games</a> was very clear. I'm sure there must be some discrepancy between the model in my brain and the model of the person who wrote this text, because it's a bit fuzzy, but I can't clearly verbalize what the discrepancy is.
 
 I think the discrepancy is around "object oriented properties are functions."
 
 PS: I understand. I understand that the word "function" here means the constraint that "only one object in the value domain corresponds to one object in the definition domain". That makes sense. It is true that in general languages, foo.bar returns a single value, so if you are used to that, you tend to implicitly assume that there is only one object in the value domain. But when you think about relationships in general, it could be zero or five. That's what I understood you meant to say.
 
 View chapter 3 for now of the paper: http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/pubs/2002/alloy-journal.pdf
 
 In the context of Alloy, the first "relation" used as a basic block is a binary relation, so "what if I want to deal with a more multinomial relation?" I say, "I can do that with a function. Currie-ize! Carying! I have the impression that the "function" is there to say, "Curry-ize!
 
 Scoremization: "For all x, there exists some y and R(x,y) holds" means "A function f maps all x to y and R(x,f(x)) holds for all x" ref: <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82 %B9%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AC%E3%83%A0%E6%A8%99%E6%BA%96%E5%BD%A2'>Skolem standard form - Wikipedia</a>
 
 I don't understand the constraint that it is a singleton expressed as some x: T | x = v. I understand the code as "x = v for any element x of Set T". I understand the code as "x = v for some element x of Set T", but isn't that not enough for the singleton constraint? all x: T | x = v would be "x = v for any element x of T, i.e. only one element v of T".
 
 The authors say that the novelties are the treatment of scalars as singleton sets, the encoding of sets as degenerate relations, and the dot operator used to form ' The first one is that it's too complicated to think of both "element (scalar) and set" and "set and set" operations, so let's consider an element as a set that contains a single element. It is just like the recent scripting languages that consider a character to be a string of length 1 because it is too complicated to distinguish between a character and a string.
 
 The second one says, "It is tedious to think about whether what is in a set is a scalar or a relation, so if there is something X that is not a relation in the set (Unit, X), let's consider it as a relation in the set.
 
 I'm not quite sure what you mean by the third one, 'navigation expressions', which is expressed in terms of double duty, but the s.t dot is just an operator for composing relations, but when s is a set and t is a relation, it's like [x.t for x in s]. I agree with id:propella that ~s.t is a direct product, not s.~t.
 
 Alloy is using Sat4j? I wonder if there is a SAT solver that I can play around with. Oh, I see from http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy4/quickguide/gui.html that you can switch between various ones. Then I'll look for something easy to play with.
 
 Hmm, Kodkod on top of a layer of sat4j or something. http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/download.html I wonder if it's actually this guy who solves the constraint problem with Alloy. interesting list of apps that use Kodkod http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/apps.html
