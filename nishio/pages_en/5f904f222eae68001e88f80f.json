　Thoughts.
　　K is one whole
　　That is, if we pre-calculate the distances from K to all vertices, the query just adds up the lengths of the two paths
　　We can DFS K as the starting point and determine the distance of each vertex
　Official Explanation
　　The policy is the same
　　[There is only one path between two vertices of a connected graph with no closed path].
　　MLE with graphs with adjacency matrices
　　 I don't usually hold it that way, so I'm not into it.
