 >The concept of "a priori" in Kant
 > The 18th century German philosopher [Immanuel Kant][/villagepump/Kant.icon], who questioned "What can I know?" and "What should I do?" and who formulated [critical philosophy] to clarify the limits of "[reason]" ([theoretical reason]) that recognizes nature and man He argued that philosophy must also follow the example of mathematics and the natural sciences and acquire a method of thinking that is both inevitable and universal. For this to happen, he said, [reason itself must be able to determine the framework of cognition], independent of all human experience. This is "[a priori recognition]" (recognition that is not mixed with anything empirical is called "[pure recognition]`[2]`).
  What kind of perception is totally independent of experience?
   Without the filtering of the Homo sapiens brain... like this...[/villagepump/issac.icon].
  Opposition to Locke[/villagepump/John Locke.icon]'s assertion that "there is no [nativity] in man" ([tabula rasa])? [/villagepump/nishio.icon]
 > According to Kant, [time] and [space] are a priori concepts. This is because these two are concepts that are recognized prior to any empirical perception `[Note 1]`.
  > It is not absolutely self-evident that these two things are prior, but what Kant is emphasizing is that nothing can be recognized as [pure intuition] unless these two things are given, as long as "[the thing itself]" cannot be recognized.
 > Note that these two are not naturally imagined times or spaces, but formal ones. They are given to pure intuition because of a new `configuration', as Kant himself supports the metaphor that even though the senses `feel' that the sun revolves around the earth, it does not in fact do so `[Note 2]`.
  >In this case, by discarding experience and senses, we can obtain a comprehensive judgment that the earth orbits the sun.
 >This space is prior to [physical space] (i.e., [a priori]). Note also the concern that if [pure intuition] is impossible, we fall into [Humean skepticism].
