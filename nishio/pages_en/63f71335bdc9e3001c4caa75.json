In-depth explanations are costly for the explainer
　The term "parallel diary" was obviously coined[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　Can you explain this to someone who has not had the "experience of multiple people writing journals on Scrapbox"?
 　Depends on depth of explanation? [/villagepump/inajob.icon].
 　I feel I can explain the situation.
　　Are you explaining a shallow situation and the people who heard you understand? [/villagepump/nishio.icon]
　　 If we participate in the topic with that shallow understanding, will we be able to have a useful discussion?
　　 If not much useful return is expected, where is the incentive for the explainer to bear the cost of explaining?
				That's what I thought when I wrote[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
