>The "market dynamics" of "value innovation" contrast favorably with those of traditional innovation. In innovation, prices are generally set higher to reduce supply. Then, as a reward, so to speak, for having innovated, they try to get the upper hand from the higher price during the introduction phase. Only later do they focus on lowering prices and costs to protect market share and prevent imitation.
	Higher prices during the introduction phase
 Large margins during the introductory period
>However, in the case of goods such as knowledge and ideas, where economies of scale, learning effects, and increasing returns are expected, quantity, price, and cost are more important than in the past. Under these circumstances, companies would be wise to expand their market size by offering unprecedented value at affordable price levels and attracting a large number of target buyers from the outset.
	Lower prices during the introduction phase
 Small margins in the introductory period
 Increase scale and then increase profit margins.
