oracle
>An oracle machine or prophecy machine is a kind of abstract machine in computational complexity theory and computability theory.
>The Turing machine is a Turing machine with an additional black box called an oracle, which can decide a specific decision problem in a single step.

 Simply put, there is a discussion about how the speed of computation would change if we added an oracle, a device that can complete a specific computation in one step, to a Turing machine as a model for "normal computation," and we skip such academic discussions and just call it [a metaphor] "a device that can complete a different process in a shorter time than normal computation. We call it an oracle, which is "a device that completes a different process in a shorter time than normal operations".
 For the average person, [emotional cognition] is like an oracle that can be executed in a short time without requiring verbal thought, and those who do not have that oracle instead perform similar processing through [verbal thinking]. We used the term [software emulation] to describe this in today's conversation. This is also a parable
		A similar phenomenon is sometimes likened to "a machine with a GPU can do something fast using the GPU, but since it does not have a GPU, the CPU is taking longer to perform it.
