Scrapbox翻訳実験
The DeepL API allows machine translation in one go, but I haven't figured out how to store and display the translated results, so I'm experimenting with machine translation by hand.

[Self-management strategies for engineers]
　Frequently Read Presentation Materials
　I did it because the textualized version is posted below the slides, so if you translate it, you can read it at least.
　I wrote this to clarify the source of the translation
　　`[jaen.icon]Machine Translation of [エンジニアのための自分経営戦略]`

[Memex]
	An experiment to see how to translate a title that is originally in English so that it is identical to the title of the original.
　I decided to put English on top for now.

[Pleasing the many is evil]
	I wanted to revise it after translating it, is this the right way to do it?

[There are two types of genus elimination.]
	It was discovered that there is no proper translation for the word [genus] in the first place.
　Since the title assumes that the concept is known up to "elimination of genus..."
　[ZOKUJINSEI] was created.
　　but to be honest, genus is not a topic of interest that I want to delve into right now.
　　So, I was not too eager to pay the cost of making an English translation.
　　　You should translate the subjects you are interested in now.
　　　　But what I just wrote could be rewritten further... so... translate the linked page, I guess.
　Would it be beneficial if I describe a machine translation result in which I want to replace the word X with Y, and so on?
　　Are you just complicating the story?
