Procedures and Experience
There is a difference between [procedures] and [experiences].
　An article that says, "This is how you can set up your system.
　　Sometimes the article is 6 years old.
　　　The official website is properly updated.
 　　Personal blogs written six years ago are rarely updated.
 　　　A medium in which blogs are likely to induce writing off in the first place.
 　A six year old article is not a problem in and of itself.
 　　If "these are the steps to set it up" isn't a lie, it doesn't matter.
 　　Often they're right when they're written, but often they turn out to be lies.
 　People who are allergic to English avoid English on official websites and read these articles.
 　　Better to machine translate and read the official website.
 Procedures and experiences are different.
 　Experiences that say, "I was able to set up this procedure" never turn out to be lies.
