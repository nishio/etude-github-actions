Sparse Table
Given a sequence of static values of length N, a data structure where the preprocessing O(NlogN) allows operations on the upper interval of the sequence to be computed in O(1)

The operations that can be used are concrete, such as min, argmin is also acceptable
	[Crossed half-bundle]
	　[Combining rule]: [$ (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)]
		[Law of Exchange]: [$ a * b = b * a].
		[Power equality]: [$ a * a = a].

Construction O(N log N)
 Calculate the min of an interval of length 2 beki from each point
 An interval of length 2^k can be calculated in constant order from two intervals of half length, so DP from the smaller one.

query
 Cover the query interval with two calculated intervals of maximum length smaller than the length of the query interval
　For example, cover with 1-4 and 4-7 for sections 1-7.
　The minimum value of the query interval is the minimum value in either of the two intervals

Use [segment tree] when columns are updated
