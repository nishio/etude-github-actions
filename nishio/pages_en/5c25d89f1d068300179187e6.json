Information presentation in VR
What I thought after doing both a poster display of lecture slides and an information display in VR at the results briefing.
When slides are small, humans approach in the real world
Because the slides on the wall don't come close.
On the other hand, in the [VR] space, you can pull the slides close to you and read them.
[By having an "attract" action, it can be triggered to "present related information" to the surrounding area, etc.
