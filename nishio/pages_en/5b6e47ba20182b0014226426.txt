Markdown
 Unique notation for decorating text created in 2004
 Created to decorate text in a more convenient way than writing HTML directly
 Focus on text decoration within a single page has consumed symbols extravagantly (`_italic_, **bold**`, etc.)
 Therefore, it is not possible to simply express page-to-page links
	Many people make the mistake of thinking that there is one unified format with the name "Markdown" [there are 9 variants as of 2016 https://www.iana.org/assignments/markdown-variants/markdown- variants.xhtml]

Comparison with [Scrapbox]'s [Bracketing
code:markdown:
 link
 [link](http://example.com)

code:scrapbox:
 link
 [link]
   Links in the project do not require URLs, just bracket the title
 [link http://example.com]
   For external links, add the URL there.

   If the external link is to an image, it will be displayed as an image.
As for images, simply paste from the clipboard and they will be uploaded automatically.
	Drag and drop is also acceptable.

In terms of [interoperability] with other services, the new bracketing is at a disadvantage to the old Markdown, but this is not surprising: when Markdown was born, it was at a disadvantage to HTML, and when JSON was born, it was at a disadvantage to XML.

It is futile to discuss the merits of the notation itself, because those who say that Markdown is good for interoperability must have thought that a less interoperable Markdown was a bad idea when Markdown was created. They are [laggards] who do not want to adopt it themselves until many others have adopted it.

Note that the term [bracketing] was introduced at [Scrapbox Drinkup 20180810].
