Harvesting the Framework

Contrast with the framework [FoundationFramework https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FoundationFramework.html], which is built as a foundation in advance.

Although it seems natural to build the framework first and then the application (since it is common practice to build the foundation first in house construction), it often does not work in practice.
First, one app is created, then another app is created based on the same code base, and after repeating this several times, the framework becomes stable and the code base can be separated.
The framework is [harvested] [after the fact].

Translation [HarvestedFramework http://bliki-ja.github.io/HarvestedFramework/]

I heard it described as "[architecture harvesting]."
