　Auto-generated avatars from photos
　I'll try to use it as an icon for a while because it's interesting to see the atmosphere it retains.

 Book Table of Contents on Scrapbox, I started making a few by hand to try it out and instantly hated it.
 　Create a UserScript that converts a bidirectional link to a one-way link?
 　[Contents reading]Do it often[/villagepump/takker.icon][/villagepump/erniogi.icon].
 　 [/motoso/contents reading].
 　I think this is a situation where there is only a "path" and the actual content is in the book and cannot be placed in Scrapbox because of copyright[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 　　They're taking advantage of the "discovery" effect of connecting roads.
 　　On the other hand, what I'm trying to do now is to present a table of contents to the reader based on the assumption that all the content is on Scrapbox.
　 There is certainly a difference between capturing only the content induction path and capturing the entire content[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 The concept of "link" in Scrapbox, if you ask 100 people who have no experience with Scrapbox, more than 90 of them will think it's a one-way link.
 So in that sense, Scrapbox is an "easy to create two-way links" system.
 　It's hard to represent bidirectional links in a tool that is primarily one-way links, so it's not going to get done.
 [Japanese translation of Scrapbox Reader https://scrapbox--reader--nishio-vercel-app.translate.goog/nishio/(6.2.4)_Parable,_metaphor,_analogy?_x_tr_sl=en &_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp]
		I'm using Scrapbox Reader to display the human translation of "The Art of Intellectual Production by Engineers" in Scrapbox, and then using Google Translate to convert it into Japanese.
		　The logic is that publishers complain when the content of a book is put directly on the Web, but they cannot prohibit users from reading machine-translated English content.
　　I have Vercel configured to return responses without blocking, so "loading" appears in the translation results.
　　I wonder if CSS can do something about the blank lines being skipped.
　　Did I follow the link and it's /en instead of /nishio? Needs to be debugged
　I can't recognize my icon as me. w
　　I'm not used to it because of the image of [/nishio] (I'll get used to it in a few days)[/villagepump/kimoto.icon][/villagepump/takker.icon].
　　Oh, I can't get used to it myself. w[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
　　　Yes, given the examples of others, I got used to it in a few days.
　　Sometimes I have a mysterious feeling that if I don't confuse my cognition, I will lose my ability to adapt w[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　 Is it a necessary ability w[/villagepump/kuuote.icon]?
　　 Certainly those who change icons will be recognized as those who change icons, so when they change, it will be "again," but for those who don't, it will be "I can't get used to it..." for a while.
　　 　Not "get used to changing icons" but more abstract [ability to adapt to change][/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　 　 For example, you go to an electronics store because your mouse is broken, and you buy a trackball that you happen to see and return home (true story).
　　 　 I started [thumb shift] because Dr. Shiozawa recommended it to me.
　　 　 It is a feeling of wanting to change things when you realize that you have become accustomed to a certain way of doing things and take it for granted.
　　 　  Well, it is indeed important to notice the "obvious"[/villagepump/kuuote.icon].
　　After seeing and thinking about the recent gender and age questions, I'm starting to feel like I'm "wanting to be free of [my] physical body" after all[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　 And yet I felt it was [inconsistent to use live-action icons simply because I'm used to using them.
　　 Then, a story about creating avatars from photos came up on Twitter, and we thought, "Why not use this as an avatar (icon) for the time being?
　　  [/icons/like.icon] [/villagepump/dai.icon][/villagepump/Mijinko_SD! .icon] [/villagepump/dai.icon][/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon]
　Until this moment, I was thinking, "I don't have a multi-public project of my own making." w
　 You have it, [unexplored name list].
　Today's Diary
　　2I fixed the title of the translated page with Pomodoro and it says "Already exists."
　　　There was already a translation!
　　I want an app that will help me get over the heartbreak of translating 4 more pages, great, I want an app that will give me positive penguin praise!
　　But a page that has two different translations, I don't dare throw one away, so the need for a merge was born [negative workload]...
