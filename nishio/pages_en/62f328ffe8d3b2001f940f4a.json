curry favour with the young
observed fact
　There's Uncle A who is communicating closely with the young man.
　Uncle B describes that Uncle A's actions as "flirting with youth."

consideration
　Choosing the word "flirtatious" means that Mr. B thinks it's a negative thing.
　　Is it negative?
　Look up "flirt" in the dictionary.
　　>Trying to get the other person to like you and make you feel good about yourself.
　　If we take it literally, shouldn't we "flirt" if we want to have a good relationship with others?
　　If you do it the other way around and do the "don't like them, get them in a bad mood" thing, I don't think you can have a good relationship with them.
　　Mr. B may think that the ideal situation is one in which young people follow him without doing anything.
　　　Some young people will think and act that way, and some young people will follow them (if they have a good personality).
　　　Some communities will have it maintained by a culture that says you should respect your elders.
　　　In general, I think the attitude that young people should respect you even if you don't do anything to them is counterproductive.
