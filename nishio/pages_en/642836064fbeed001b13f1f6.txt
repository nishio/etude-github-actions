Don't leave a bit of a mess.
　I'm not going to overlook something that I thought was a little bad.
　　First, look at what you think "[yuck].
　　Either the human side has to change or the subject side has to change.
	　If you do something that you feel a little bad about, you won't do it.

[Wife's advice].
