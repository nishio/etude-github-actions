	[Testing Policy]
	　[https://gyazo.com/d39aeaa66e75a16771389159cb5e2c3c]
　　There seems to be a lot of different styles, like putting the test target in main, but I don't want to change it for testing because I'm using this structure to match the official documentation on deploying to Heroku.
	　python -m pytest` as root
	　	see [-m pytest]
	　The current directory goes into sys.path, so you can do things like from server.keicho import process_command from the test code, straightforward.
	　You can also do `%run tests/test_foo.py` in ipython
	　　You can use the test runner when you call it all together, but when you want to debug, you want to use the debugger.
	　Try individual test files with `python -m pytest tests/test_foo.py` and run them all when you're done.
	　　Test cases that hit the server are heavy, and the server's behavior shouldn't change unless you deploy the modifications at hand in the first place.
	When I did 2 of the [testing policy], it behaved unexpectedly, which confused me, so I went through 3, 4, and so on, testing and digging to find out the cause.
	　Bottom line, bugs put in at the time of porting.
	　For some reason, keyword extraction runs against the command as well."
	　Mistakes that refactor without testing and change behavior.
	Test Stability
	　There was supposed to be no random element, but in some cases the process of "choosing the largest score" resulted in the same score.
	　　We've made it a form of clogging a little bit for those who want to prioritize.
