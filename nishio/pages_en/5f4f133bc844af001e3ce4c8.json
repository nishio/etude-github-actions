Pythonの高速化
　1: Devise an algorithm
　2a: Run it with [PyPy
　 When there are many array subscript accesses, etc.
　2b: [Numpy]を使う
　　When there are many batch operations on arrays
　3a: AOT compilation in [Numba].
　　Fast if you get into it right, but still very limited in terms of data structures and libraries
　　Cannot be recursively called
　3b: Write and compile in [Cython
　　Fast if written properly.
　　Writing properly is like writing a program in C.
　3c: Writing libraries in C++
