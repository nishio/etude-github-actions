ABC175
I solved 3 questions and the rating increased slightly.
　It's not clear to me that I only solved 3 questions, but those 3 questions were solved in 18 minutes, so I guess it's a light blue performance?
　AtCoder problems, C is unknown difficulty.

	Exactly the same as the official explanation.
	Potential question, "How do you come up with that?"
　　Solve for small specific values, like X=5, D=2, etc.
　　While the absolute value of X is greater than D, it moves in the direction of decreasing
　　When small, it oscillates across the origin.
　　　The number of cycles is 2, so look at the remainder of the number of cycles remaining divided by 2.
code:python
 def solve(X, K, D):
     X = abs(X)
     a = X // D
     if a >= K:
         return X - K * D
     r = X % D
     K -= a
     if K % 2 == 0:
         return r
     else:
         return D - r
