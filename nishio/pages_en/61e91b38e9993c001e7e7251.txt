(3) How to train your memory
In Chapter 1, we saw the [cycle of learning]. In Chapter 2, we learned about the [driving force] for the cycle. 

By turning the cycle, do you keep going around the same place, or do you climb little by little like a [spiral staircase]?

It depends on whether knowledge obtained by one cycle accumulates or not. In this chapter, we learn about the accumulation of what we learned, in other words, the [memory].
