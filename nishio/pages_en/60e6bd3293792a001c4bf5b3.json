　The trick is to put the number at the beginning of the radio button choices.
　　Aggregate by number of records and sort in ascending or descending order rather than by "aggregate value".
　　Then the 6 o'clock position on the pie chart would be the median.

At this point, I'm thinking, "When I put them in ascending order, the 6's are in front of them? Why is that?" There was a
That's what the ambiguity of "ascending or descending order" is all about.

　The trick is to put the number at the beginning of the radio button choices.
　　(I thought it was, but it wasn't.)
　　Aggregate by number of records and sort in ascending or descending order rather than by "aggregate value".
　　 The sorting at this time is by order of the choices, so 6 comes first in ascending order.
　　Then the 6 o'clock position on the pie chart would be the median.

I realized I misunderstood the sorting criteria.

　The trick is to put the number at the beginning of the radio button choices.
　　(I thought it was, but it wasn't.)
　　Aggregate by number of records and sort in ascending or descending order rather than by "aggregate value".
　　 The sorting at this time is in the order of the choices, so 6 comes first in ascending order (it doesn't matter that I put the number at the beginning).
　　Then the 6 o'clock position on the pie chart would be the median.

I added how it was different.
