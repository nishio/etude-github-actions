There are a lot of people who are wrong.
When you think, "There are so many people who are wrong," maybe it's you who's wrong.

This needs a little more digging.
　When you feel that "X is clearly A and not B," and yet there are many people who say, as an observational fact, that "X is B."
　I feel "there are a lot of people out there who are wrong," but that's the lack of relativism
　Using the word X in the sense that you think it is X is implicitly constrained by context
　The other person makes me look crazy for not sharing the context.

	Mr. P thinks "X is A, not B".
	This X is X0 implicitly constrained by context to a narrow X1
	By the same logic, it could also be "X is B, not A" depending on the context.
