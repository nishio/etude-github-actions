[One-dimensional] of [Two-dimensional arrangement].
	Closest.

	If it's just a few pieces, I feel like I can write them down without thinking about the details and then organize them later.

		Then I guess we could compress the horizontal axis and then do hierarchical clustering, with the top right corner first between clusters.
