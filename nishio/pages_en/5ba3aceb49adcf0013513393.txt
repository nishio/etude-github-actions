	Not having to chase [short-term] [cash flow] is a management [advantage].
 	More options compared to competitors who have to chase cash flow.
	 Long-term optimization is possible.

 	Whether or not it is [profitable].
 Tends to lead to the short-sighted idea that "no pay = bad."
 	Short-term and long-term perspectives are often overlooked
  Investments that are profitable in the long run usually don't pay off in the short run.
