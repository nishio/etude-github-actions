Pomodoro Clicker
Pomodoro with Cookie Clicker

Touch the timer again between 20 and 30 minutes after starting the timer to receive points.

No point in clicking fast or slow.

I think I've had similar thoughts before.
[Pomodoro game proposal]

It would be nice to get 1 coin after 1 pomodoro and use that 1 coin to buy "+1 production per pomodoro".
And after that?

Would it be nice to have some kind of facility to receive bonuses based on the number of days of continuous play?

For Realm Grinder
　Click to get coins.
　　This is where the "Pomodoro gets the coin".
　Buy buildings with coins
　　This will produce resources over time without clicking, but is that inappropriate for a Pomodoro game?
　Buy a certain amount of buildings and you can buy upgrades.
　　Increase building production
　　This creates up to two assistants in each building.
　Assistants generate clicks.
　Clicks also generate faction coins.
　Faction coins are used to purchase upgrades for each species.
　　This upgrade varies by species.
　　By only being able to choose one species at a time, you will have to reset many times
　When you reset the system, you get Gems depending on the amount you earned, and the amount of coins you earn increases with Gems from then on.
　　

→Would you like to see a probability increase in rewards instead of a definite increase?

Since they don't click, "clicker" is wrong.
If anything, it's "cookie pomodorer."

No more coins by leaving it alone, but more multipliers.

Why not just get cookies instead of coins directly from one pomodoro, sell those cookies to get coins, and use the coins to invest in equipment?
Then it is natural that the selling price of cookies would increase with the improvement

Cookie toppings increase the price, but make it unclear what they do to increase the price.

Webhook to start and end pomodoro?
