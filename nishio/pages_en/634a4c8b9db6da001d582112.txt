　>Caused by damage to the cells of the olfactory epithelium, the part of the nose that senses smells, during a cold or other upper respiratory infection, and when they regenerate, they mistakenly send smell signals to the center.
　>I find it unpleasant as a smell, as if it were "burnt" or "rotten".

 This one from this morning.
 I guess my nose wasn't in good shape to begin with because of the fall pollen allergy.
 On top of that, he wore a mask from 3pm to midnight.
 I woke up in the morning and it stunk.
 At first I was like, "Did I sweat because I walked out yesterday? (Even though I took a bath?" "Is it because I ate Chinese food?" Or maybe my scalp smells like I'm getting old?" But according to my wife, there was no unusual smell, so I guess I have a bad nose.
 I've had a whiff of the smell before, but never one that lasted.
 It went away after one night.
