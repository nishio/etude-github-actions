DP W
[W - Intervals https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_w]
　There are 200,000 columns of length 200,000 consisting of 0s and 1s, and 200,000 rules of "how many points if there is a 1 in this range", find how many points you get if you make the best column.
　What would happen if implemented naively?
　　Calculate score for each sequence of 2^200000 and max -> yikes!
　　Instead of calculating for each number sequence, can we use the results from the middle of the sequence to calculate more efficiently?

>`dp[i] = max when (having decided up to i) the last one is i. The transition is dp[i] = min(dp[j] | j=0~i-1). Then we do a adding a to dp[l~i] for the interval [l,i]. segtree to make it faster (we only need to be able to do interval add and interval min) O((N+M) log N)`
