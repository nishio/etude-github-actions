Inconvenience of Notability
[Inconvenience] of [Notability].
	[I want to move quickly back and forth between multiple pages.]
	[Point to...]
	Every time I move a task after exporting it, I need to select the lasso.
		I want it to be easily [lumped together] once selected.
	Cannot recall relevant pages from the past
	I would like to have an after-the-fact index of some of the things I've written, or just look back at the muscle training logs in one place, etc.
		Caused by a lack of means of pointing to what has been written
		With Scrapbox, you could just write `[muscle training]`.
