Breaking deadlines to improve quality
 I felt uncomfortable when I saw the statement, "I break deadlines because I take pride in the quality of my work."
 It is not obvious that breaking deadlines will lead to improved quality, since breaking deadline commitments will cause quality to deteriorate as people in the back end of the process will have less time for the final checking process.
 For those who do not meet deadlines, editors often recognize that this is a person who does not meet deadlines and give them earlier deadlines, so that delays do not cause too many problems in the later stages of the process.
  The editor's management skills prevent the shortcoming of not meeting deadlines from causing problems.
  Whether the reason for that "not meeting deadlines" is "trying to improve quality" or "playing games" may be important to his subjective pride, but both are pretexts from others, and either way, the situation is the same: the manuscript is not due on the scheduled arrival date and the later process cannot proceed.

 Regarding the statement made at the same time, "I don't like to bow out of meeting deadlines.
  I am of the position that "the task of improving quality expands infinitely, so it is necessary to first set a deadline and meet it," and since deadlines can be determined by external factors or by oneself, I feel that the statement "I meet deadlines because I don't want to bow down" ignores the voluntary deadlines.
