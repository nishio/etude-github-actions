Tends to make the question the title.
　If the question is the root of a bullet point and the discussion is developed below it, the root is the title because it is at the top
　　If you've come to a conclusion, should you put the conclusion in the title?
　　In the future, we may come to different conclusions about the same question.
　　　Make the question part a link?
　concrete example
　　before "Why study old people?"
　　after "Technology that doesn't make you old is beneficial to your intellectual productivity in life as a whole."
