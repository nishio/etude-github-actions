Action -> Habit -> Personality -> Destiny is a little quicker.
	This does not include "watch".
In 1856 a newspaper in Colchester, England
>”Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.” 
> You sow an act, you reap a habit (acts repeated constitute habits);
>  you sow a habit, you reap a character;
>  you sow a character, you reap a destiny.
What one sows, one will surely reap.
If you sow an act, you reap a habit (repetition of an act becomes a habit).
Sow the habit, reap the character.
Sow your character, reap your destiny.
