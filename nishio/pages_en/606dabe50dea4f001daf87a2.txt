✅Implemented questions and actions for empathic writing
　No transition until you do the "next question" to the next question?
　No, we should transition when we run out of good keywords.
　Just the two basic questions? Do you want to include a metaphor question?
　Do you want to put them together in an empathy writing module or in a state transition description?
　　The transitions don't mix, so it's cleaner to separate them.
　　Let's run it once, cover it with tests, and then refactor it.
　Separated because it is hard to write if not separated.
　　I wanted to generate a loop of consecutive state transitions.
　　Writing where the dictionary describes it is messy.
　Summarized in the empathy_writing module
　Need to enforce state transitions
　　Usually transitions to the next state when the next question is asked.
　　What if I use the "next question" command?
　　　Ask the next question and transition to the next state
　　Can we add that as a plugin with the current structure?
　　The command only returns a bool whether it was a command or not, and if you should ask a specific question, you need to transition to a state where you only ask that question.
　　　Tricky?
　　　If you were to change it, how would you change it?
　　　Hmmm, I feel like we'll end up just having a different form of state than state.
　　　This is troubling.
　　Decided to increase the number of states.
