Ignore the smears and move on to success.
Leverage notes from [Baltasar Gracián's Philosophy of Success
 Silence the slander of others. Don't use your energy to prove your innocence. Use your energy for your own success.

---
 Ignore people's slander.
 Silence them.
 Do not appeal to the power of the pen to clear your name.
 	What is written will remain forever, so rather than punishing the enemy, it is helping to perpetuate its name.
  There is no revenge better than oblivion.

	Do not fight with others.
 	Few fight fairly.
  The enemy will try to use whatever is available, even resorting to sneaky tactics that should not be used.
  He gets no benefit from doing so, but the small satisfaction of knowing that he got even is enough for him.

	Those who wish others misfortune are annoyed when they see them succeed. The most ingenious punishment is to make your success a poison for the other person.

	Do not fight what you have nothing to lose.
 	Even if you defeat your opponent, you cannot get back what you have lost.
