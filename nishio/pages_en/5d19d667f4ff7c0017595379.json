Redux could make you happy.
	[Reduxed]
 Redux is a state management mechanism
 React's original state management is passed on through props, etc.
 Redux has a singleton-like object called a store that takes care of state management.
 Mediator pattern in that it unifies complex interactions by placing a single intermediary
 If used raw, the state is just like a global variable, but by adding restrictions to the way the state is updated, it seems to be operated safely.
	Maybe I should study Redux and migrate to it, because now I'm finally getting annoyed and saying "I'm sure this component is single, so let's expose the set in the module scope".
