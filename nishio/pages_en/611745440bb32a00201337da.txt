Ignore people's slander.
>Ignore [slander]. It is best to respond with [silence]. Do not appeal to the power of the pen to clear your name. What is written will remain forever, so instead of punishing the enemy, you are helping to keep his name. [There is no revenge better than oblivion.]
[Baltasar Graci√°n's philosophy of success].
