 Year-end schedule
 >>
 I'll introduce the middle limit in English in the near future.
 I guess I'll take inventory of what I've made so far over the holiday season.
 I'll just make a list of links to Japanese entries in English for now, and mark and replace the English entries in the order that they are created.
 I just looked at my Blogger profile and saw that I'm "writing a Jython book" and wondered how long I've been neglecting it.

 Once a year, it seems like a good idea to reread blog entries and the like and make a list of things that should be sent out in English, even if it means looking back at what you have done.
