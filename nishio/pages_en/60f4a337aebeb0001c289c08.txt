 The ㄱ (g in Hangul) is read strongly when it is at the beginning of a word. Japanese speakers sometimes interpret this as "g becomes k at the beginning of a word"!
　On the other hand, ㅋ (k in Hangul) is a sound distinct from ㄱ. Japanese speakers may interpret this as a "strong k
　The relationship between the two languages is symmetrical, but sometimes there are Japanese speakers who are aware that "Korean does not distinguish between g and k".
　　If that is True, then similarly, from the point of view of Korean speakers, "Japanese does not distinguish between g and k" is also True, but they don't seem to pay much attention to that one.
　I've been trying to figure out why this phenomenon occurs.
　　I only focus on what I distinguish and worry that others don't distinguish it.
　　When others distinguish what you don't distinguish, you don't care about that distinction.
　I thought there was an asymmetry that

　[Hoge Language Paradox]
　　>When this programmer looks down the spectrum of power, he is aware that he is doing so. A language with less power than "hoge" obviously has less power. It doesn't have the features he's accustomed to. But when this programmer looks in the opposite direction, he does not realize that he is looking up. All he sees is a strange language. Maybe they are as powerful as "hoge," but somehow they have all sorts of fluffy extras, he thinks. For him, "hoge" is enough. Because he thinks in "hoge.

　　Talk about how when you see a programming language that has a feature that your programming language doesn't have, that feature looks like crap.
　　When you see a language that has a distinction that your language doesn't have, the same composition makes that distinction seem trivial.
