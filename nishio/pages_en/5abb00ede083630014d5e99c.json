According to another record, the slump period was from 10/27/2008 to 5/1/2010.
I started reading Drucker around February 2010 and have been attending Tokyo Tech MOT since 2011.
He felt a sense of crisis: "If I only had my expertise as an engineer, I would be in trouble if that turned out to be inadequate."
This slump should have been a strong reason for him to think about expanding into fields other than programming, but until he looked back on it this time, it was completely absent from his memory.
