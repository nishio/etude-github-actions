Raku-Raku Smartphone 3 Trap
In brief:
	Some products sold under the name of "smart phones" are not available with so-called "smart phone apps

To put it a little more technically:
	Raku-Raku Smartphone 3 (model number: F-06F) is an Android device, but it does not support Google Play, which is usually used to install applications on Android devices, and when I press the install button below, the error message "You cannot download applications from this site. When I press the install button below, I get an error message "You can't download the application from this site.

point of concern
	Most people in the world, including myself yesterday, are unaware that there is a complicated situation in which there are mobile devices that look like smartphones but cannot use applications designed for smartphones.
 So, "If you put this app on that phone, you can do this," "Let's try it. Huh? It won't go in..." "What? I wonder why?" exchanges are happening.
	 Elderly people unfamiliar with smartphones may wonder if there is something wrong with their operation, or conversely, think "this is what smartphones are like," but the reality is that "the device is just special.

warp and weft
	I went home to my parents and my mother was using a smart phone.
 Introducing Apps
 When I try to install it, I get "You cannot download the application from this site.
 I happen to be an engineer, so I peeled off the cover and checked the device model number.
 I searched by model number and found out this is a "Raku Raku Smartphone".
 	I decided, "This is not Android, so I guess I can't put Android apps on it." (This is a misunderstanding. (See below.)
  I told them that, and they had all sorts of additional problems.
  	I've never been able to get an app from Google Play, not even this one.
   I'm on LINE with my sisters, but the video stamps on their devices are still images on my device.
   I get the same error when I try to buy stamps.
  I told him I don't think that's going to be solved as long as he's using this device.

	After that.
	 If you look up the model number and look at [spec sheet https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/support/utilization/product/f06f/spec.html], it says the OS is Android 4.4.
  Therefore, "I can't use Android apps because I'm not Android" is a misunderstanding.
 The successor is out on February 10, 2017.
 	Its successor, "[Raku Raku Smartphone 4 https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/product/easy_phone/f04j/index.html?icid=CRP_PRD_f04j_top_up]" claims to be "Google Play compatible".
		An article can be found describing that it was not available on previous models but is available from 4 [ITmedia Mobile http://www.itmedia.co.jp/mobile/articles/1703/27/news083.html].
		Conclusion that Raku-Raku Smartphone 3 is "Android, but it does not support Google Play, which is normally used to put applications on Android devices, so it is not possible to install Android applications in the normal way.
