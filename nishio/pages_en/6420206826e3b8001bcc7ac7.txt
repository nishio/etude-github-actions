At some stage, the machine takes over.
[Alan Turing] # Turing.
>Alan M. Turing was a major figure in the field of computer science who died in 1954. His mother Sara published a book about his life in 1959, and she included a draft of a lecture he delivered in Manchester, England in 1951. Turing’s address titled “Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory” explored the consequences of building computer systems capable of displaying intelligence. Boldface added to excerpts by QI:
	>There would be plenty to do in trying, say, to keep one’s intelligence up to the standard set by the machines, for it seems probable that [* once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers]. There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler’s Erewhon.

(DeepL)
	For example, if you want to maintain your intelligence at the level set by the machine, you can do so as much as you want.
 We are not sure how long it will take for the machines to surpass our feeble powers of thought once they get started.
 The machines will not die, and the machines will be able to talk to each other and gather their wits.
 Therefore, as discussed in Samuel Butler's "Erewhon," we must expect the machine to take the initiative at some stage.
