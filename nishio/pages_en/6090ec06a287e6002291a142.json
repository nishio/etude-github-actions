 *1297243816*Formulas on a Mac.
 I have not had the need to write a lot of formulas since I left graduate school, and I had not yet set up a TeX environment because I switched to Mac, but, well, I want to put formulas in Keynote, so I did some research and investigation!
 
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/earth2001y/20050516/p1'>TeX formulas in Keynote - Obinataâ˜†</a>
 
 But this is a 6 year old article, and the link from LaTeX Equation Editor to how to install LaTeX is broken, and it smells like an overpopulated village!
 
 I found that <a href='http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/programmation/latexit_en.php'>LaTeXiT</a>, which has the same ease-of-use, was last updated in September 2010, and its page According to the description on the page, the TeX environment is "My selection is MacTeX, which is a wrapper of TeXLive. Even though I am not familiar with the recent TeX environment, I had heard about TeXLive, so I decided to use it.
 
 I thought it would take a long time to download MacTeX, but it was about 1 GB, but once the download was complete, all I had to do was double-click with the mouse and the installer would run.
 
 All you have to do is start LaTeXiT, write TeX, press a button, and drag and drop the resulting image into Keynote!

 But well, can't you do something about the fact that it takes about 10 seconds to press a button and create a PDF? Machine power must be much more powerful than it used to be...
