(5.3) Tuning for busy people
I have described all the steps of the KJ method in the previous sections.

Jiro Kawakita is an anthropologist. In other words, he can use a long time to organize ideas.

On the other hand, many readers of this book are busy. The lack of time constantly plagues us. So I think the original KJ method does not fit our situation. If the situation changes, we need to design a methodology accordingly. As I said in [(0.1.1) What is Intellectual Production], [The optimal way to boost creativity depends on your situation, so you need to build it by yourself.]

In this section, I discuss how to modify the KJ method to do in a limited, fragmentary time.
