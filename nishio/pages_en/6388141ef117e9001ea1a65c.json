The KJ method is four times more difficult when the number of sheets doubles.
The combination of two labels to choose from among 10 labels is
[$ 10 \times 9 \div 2 = 45]
The combination of two labels to choose from among 20 labels is
[$ 20 \times 19 \div 2 = 190]
and increased by 4.2 times.
This "when the number of sheets doubles, the time it takes to consider how to combine two sheets quadruples" is the basis for the difficulty of the KJ method with a large number of sheets.

Compared to flipping labels one at a time, spreading them out over a larger space so that they can be looked over simply by moving your gaze reduces the cost of "looking at the next one".
However, the limitation of the resolution of the human eye limits the number of images that can be viewed at one time.
