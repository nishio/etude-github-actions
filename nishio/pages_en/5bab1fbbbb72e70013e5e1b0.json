Very good book, but also crunchy, so it's not a book you can read once off the top of your head like most books.

	[Linear problem solving].
		A problem-solving method based on linear causality.
		By tracing causality back in a linear fashion and removing or changing the ultimate cause that has been arrived at, the result is changed and the problem is solved.
	[CIRCULAR PROBLEM SOLVING]
		A problem-solving method used when the cause and effect relationship is a loop, as in a [chicken and egg] relationship.
		Change the perception of the problem, not eliminate or change the ultimate cause
		Bring change to a vicious circle and indirectly change the problem.
