What only I can do
>"Do what only you can do", whether "only you can do" is difficult to verify, so naturally I think "[subjectively]" OR "within your observation range" is a prerequisite, but I am worried that the type of person who is not confident in himself might think "I am not good enough because I cannot verify" or something like that.

The [scope of observation] has expanded, making it more difficult for "only I can do it.
In the days of narrow observation, the best drawer in the class could go on with the self-perception that he or she was good at drawing.

Maybe something like "if you're the best at it within a 5 meter perimeter" would be better.
