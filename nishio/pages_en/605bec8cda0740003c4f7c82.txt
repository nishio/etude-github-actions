Book Reviews
(Conversation in the context of a terrible review)
I got comments like "you obviously didn't even read the preface" when I was there, so I'm wondering if there are people who are just venting their frustration like that.

It was not a good idea to assume the existence of malicious intent, saying that he was "just trying to vent his sorrows." It may be that he is just attacking what he perceives as "evil" in his cognitive abilities, based on his overwhelming good intentions to improve society. It could just be that his cognition is out of sync with the majority of the world.

Reviews of books can only be verified by buying the book to see if the review is appropriate, so if you review a book with confidence, even if it is contrary to the facts, you will get a "helpful" rating. Because of the way reviews work, you cannot give a review that says "this review is wrong," so if you confine yourself to reviews, you will not be refuted.
