Translation and Scrapbox
I'm rather negative about whether Scrapbox is suitable for writing books from scratch, but it may be outstanding for [translation].

Why do you think so?

Where we chose a translation that is not just a literal translation when translating, it is a [handle] on a special [chunk of concepts], and there is no way to express that in a normal translation, but Scrapbox can do the bracketing.

Bracket it, make a page, and note that this is how it was in the original, but changed with this intention, so that when you come up with a better translation later, you can correct it all together by renaming the page.

In other words, Scrapbox is very useful to manage the situation of "a chunk of a concept but no handle" where the appropriate translation cannot be found.

The reason why I don't find it useful when writing from scratch is because it's a tool that keeps the book in an undefined form, not a tool that makes it a tight, finished book #tools that keep it undefined

There's no [structuring pressure].

what is translation?

We call it translation, but it may not be translation in the first place.

The author himself is looking at the Japanese text and outputting it in English, often ignoring the original...

This is intellectual production using the "[format change]" of changing the language, right?
