song lyrics
 How long has it been since I was here?
  Sudden appearance of a huge dragon
  The Lord will not disappear again 带来灾难带走了公主带走了公主又消失不见
  The kingdom is in danger
  The bravest of all
  一位勇者赶来大声喊

	"I need
 	带上最好的剑
 	翻过最高的山
 	deepest forest
 	把公主带回到面前"

	The King is very happy.
		Busy asking other people's first and last names
		轻人想了想
		other people's story

	"Your Majesty, I shout
		达拉崩吧斑得贝迪卜多比鲁翁"
			Dá lā bēng ba bān dé bèi dí bo duō bǐ lǔ wēng

	"I'll tell you again."

	"达拉崩吧斑得贝迪卜多比鲁翁"

	"This is not the case.
		达拉崩吧斑得贝迪卜多比鲁翁"

	"For
