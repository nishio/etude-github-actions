Not getting sick is the top priority.
I've seen a number of people whose brains are not supposed to be bad hardware specs, but who get into bad behavior patterns and as a result are unable to make effective use of their lives for long periods of time or devastate their reputations.
ã€€It is difficult to distribute such information because [defamation is not allowed even if it is true].

Not getting sick in the long run is the highest priority indicator for effective use of life.

[It is difficult for a sick person to recognize himself.]

One pattern of sick people is [the disconnect between their delusional selves and their real selves].
