　Thoughts.
　　Distance between a point and a line segment
　　Distance to the foot of the perpendicular line if it is in the line segment, otherwise distance to either of the end points
　　Endpoints are not possible this time due to the conditions of convex polygons.
　　The leg of the perpendicular line from P to AB can be obtained by removing the directional component of AB from AP
　Official Explanation
　　I solved it with vectors, but the official explanation was in the complex plane.
