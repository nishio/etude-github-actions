 black-white conflict
 Conflict between smooth and spiky
Both are conflicts.
Both the black circle and the white spiky spike are in conflict with the white circle. But these two are not the same. Nor are they similar.

There are two attributes here: black and white and smooth/spiky. If we add the "black spiky" not shown in this diagram, the whole structure looks like this

 White circles and black spiky spikes have nothing in common and appear to be [irrelevant] information.
 Those that feel "in conflict" are "closer" than those that don't even feel that way."

So far, we have talked about a world with two types of attributes, each with two different values (black and white, smooth and spiky). There are many more attributes in the world, and each attribute can take on a variety of values.

Let's observe how the number of attributes affects the simple case where one attribute has only two possible values. The lines in the figure connect elements that differ only in the value of one attribute. The limit of human intuition would be the case of three attributes that can be imagined on the edges of a three-dimensional cube.

 One, two, three, four attributes.
 Note: There is an error in the Attribute 4 diagram.
	Footnote: Named "boolean lattice

It is not good to use the word "conflict" to imagine something like a "good vs. evil dichotomy" with one attribute. In reality, there are a myriad of attributes.

The pictures of flowers presented in [(5.2.4.6) Family resemblance] have four attributes
	The four characteristics of the target are described as 1111,
	Group 1
		1110, 1010, 1100, 0110
	Group 2
		0011, 0001, 0101, 1001
	If we draw this on a Boolean bundle with 4 attributes, we get this

　Red is Group 1, blue is Group 2
　 It's not a good idea to identify them by color, so correct them when you redraw them.

Looking at this figure, one would feel that Group 1 is closer to the target than Group 2.
The feeling is born of a different cause than familial similarity.
The difference between Group 1 and Group 2 is that Group 1 includes distance 1, 1110, and Group 2 includes distance 3, 0001.

When we think about conflict, we tend to imagine a one-attribute conflict.
And we tend to think that pairs in conflict are distant.
But the real world has many attributes.
And in that situation, what is in conflict is in closer proximity than what is not even in conflict.

So far, we have talked about two types of attributes (black and white, smooth and spiky). There are many more attributes to what happens in the world, and we have not even grasped how many attributes there are in total.

Let's observe what effect the number of attributes has in the simple case where one attribute has only two possible values.
