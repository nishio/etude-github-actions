Converted to tree with roots because the graph is a tree
If a graph is a tree with N vertices and N-1 edges, it is sometimes easier to think by [transforming it into a rooted tree] with the appropriate vertex as the root

I think it's because you get to use concepts like parent, ancestor, [minimum common ancestor], height, etc., compared to when you're thinking vaguely in terms of graphs.
