>I was taught this "power to go through" by [Tatsuhiko Miyagawa].
> "Mr. Takabayashi is talking a lot about the ability to go through things. Mr. Takabayashi and I have the ability to go through things, but Mr. XX is very serious, so he can't go through a lot of things. It would be better if you could just go through with it.
> Use it like that.

>>I have been omitting comments of mere affirmation or agreement because they are not informative, but then I would have to mention them in case of denial or disagreement. Is it necessary to comment on agreement in order to go through disagreement? Wouldn't it be zero information if I rephrased what I understood in my own words instead of mere agreement?
> The least expensive way to deal with comments is to "let it all go by," but I am not good enough at letting comments I disagree with go by, so I can't put them on the same level as comments I agree with, and I end up going right into them. As a result, I end up having a lot of discussions with the person who wrote the comment I disagree with.
>I guess the correct response is to agree when the comments are agreeable and go through the motions when the comments are disagreeable. It seems obvious when you think about it.

>[Ignore people's slander]. It is hard to answer with silence. Do not appeal to the power of the pen to clear your name. What is written will remain forever, so instead of punishing the enemy, you are helping to perpetuate his name. There is no revenge better than oblivion.
>>Do not fight with people. There are few who will fight fairly. The enemy will try to use whatever is available, even resorting to sneaky tactics that should not be used. He has nothing to gain by doing so, but it is enough for him to feel a little satisfaction that he got even with them.
>>The one who wishes others misfortune is annoyed when they succeed. The most ingenious punishment is to make one's success a poison for one's partner.
>>Do not fight what you have nothing to lose. Even if you defeat your opponent, you cannot get back what you have lost.
> "[the ability to go through]"? Also [you shouldn't fight someone anonymous who has nothing to lose]. You should use the effort of fighting to build up your own accomplishments.
