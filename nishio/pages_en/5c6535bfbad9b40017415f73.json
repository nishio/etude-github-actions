Recovery when working from buggy output
	The buggy program transformed the original data A to create B.
	This conversion is of the type that rewrites some lines of A
	B is assumed to override A
	I noticed the bug after working on the overwriting for a while based on B.
	What to do?

	First, retrieve the original data A from Dropbox version control
	Commit to Git (so that you can immediately return to A)
	Commit B, commit C
	Eliminate bugs in the program to create the correct conversion result D from the original data A
	Cherry-pick C after committing this D

	This will lead to a "manual correction C for the correct conversion".
	Some conflicts occur and we will fix them.
