Specific examples of math book selections


In college, professors often recommend books to be used in seminars and we often follow their recommendations. In contrast, I once used book A for a seminar, which I chose myself, saying "No, I want to read this". I got stuck here and there with wrong theorems, etc. After a few months of doing it, I said, "This book is no good," and changed to textbooks B and C, the classic and already highly regarded texts chosen by the teacher.

While it is fine to have the experience of making your own choices and making mistakes, it may be more efficient to honestly follow the wisdom of those who have gone before you.

A was just two years old at the time; B had been on the market for 36 years; and C was 20 years old. Some of the terminology seemed old-fashioned.
