Animals in fences
The story of people who don't want to know what they don't know because "they don't know it."
Animals inside the fence and outside the fence
There's not a huge difference in the rate at which grass grows inside and outside the fence, but inside the fence it's being eaten away.
You can eat grass that grows bigger outside the fence.

If you don't try to know what you don't know because you don't know it, you will always be kept in a state of "not knowing", which is like a fence that confines an animal.

If you've never been outside the fence, you've never seen the greenery outside the fence.
