X has feature Y" (X itself [has a feature]) and "If X exists, we can [create] Z with feature Y" are mathematically different, but in engineering applications where we just want something that satisfies feature Y, our main concern is whether we can get it, so we may not make much of a distinction between the two. So, we may not distinguish between the two very much.
