 *1315442582* 5-day photo reading test, part 2
 Let's continue with the 5-day test for photoreading as we did yesterday (<a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110907/1315358107'>Trying the 5-day test for photoreading</a>). Today's process is
 - Day 3: Preparation → Photo → Vertical reading → X reading
 It is. The declaration of purpose is the same as before: to get a rough understanding of Freud, to determine if the book contains anything useful for my life, and to make a leveraged memo to post on my blog in 5 days. 25 minutes (1 pomodoro) of photo reading and vertical reading (super reading ), I looked at the list of keywords (or rather notes) and made another memo since I was so busy.

 Note: The new theory is inherently flawed. Why? Because in order to be new, it is necessary to destroy existing assumptions and the like, rather than merely redraw existing ones, but on the other hand, in order to be expressed in the spirit of the times, it is inevitably impossible to move away from existing conceptual structures.
 
 Well, after the second Pomodoro, that is, after 50 minutes of reading this book, I have come to realize that I am interested in Freud's story of the unconscious and repression, but I don't seem to be very interested in the classification of personality structures or the symbolic language of dreams. Why is that, perhaps, because it is "not disprovable. This is not science, just a description of a worldview. The preconceived notion that no matter how widely loved and used the Cthulhu Mythos system is in various works, it does not mean that the Cthulhu Mythos is true. Is this preconception correct? Is it not a fallacy? This "Thinking about the Question" is strictly an assignment for tomorrow, Day 4, but I'll make a note of it so I don't forget.
 
 Note: Q: Is the classification of dream symbolic language and personality structure a science?

 <body>I am studying the discipline of analytical psychology. <BR>While some of Freud's theories are interesting, I don't think we should believe in them too much. <BR>In particular, I think it is better not to believe too much in Freudian dream diagnosis. <br>There are many problems with psychoanalysis in clinical practice, and I don't think it is practiced much anymore. <BR>However, the existence of the unconscious has been discovered in the field of neuroscience, and it is quite fun. <br><br>For reference. </body>
