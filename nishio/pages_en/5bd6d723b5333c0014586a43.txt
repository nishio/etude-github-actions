OVRInput
https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-ovrinput/
>To use OVRInput, you must either:
 > Include an instance of [OVRManger] anywhere in your scene; or
 > Call OVRInput.Update() and OVRInput.FixedUpdate() once per frame at the beginning of any componentâ€™s Update and FixedUpdate methods, respectively.
But when I tried to drag-drop OVRManager onto Scene, it was NG.
Isn't this it?

It seems like it should be added as a component of some object (like [mother monolith]), not a scene?
