Failure to observe diversity.

I thought I didn't get my point across with [the cost of diversity], so I illustrated it.
	[The majority's perception of the current situation is out of sync with reality.
		Red circles are placed where you think is best for the range of your observations.
		But in reality [a minority] is forced to pay the cost ("far from... .")
	Proposed correction: moved the red circle to the optimal position (center of gravity) for the whole
		But for a minority, it's just a drop in the bucket.
		Majority that did not observe the minority feels "far away".
			This is what I wanted to say in "[The Cost of Diversity]"
			The "cost of diversity," as the majority calls it, is simply a cost that has not been observed before
			And they think they've paid the cost, but it's not at all sufficient to meet the needs of the minority.
	The ideal state is not "moving the red circle to where it belongs," but "increasing the red circle itself."
		To use a specific example, it's not about what kind of work you do, but about how you choose to work.

   	>Initially 2 classifications, later 3, then 9 in 2013, ending in 2018 with the ability to set up each person individually.
		This would allow for the participation of those who have been in the minority because of the costs imposed on them.
			Blue X markings are increasing.
			For example, people who could not work 9:00-5:00 or 7:00-3:00 will be able to work by diversifying their options.
