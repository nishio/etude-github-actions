Exchange of product and sum
All products added together are multiplied by the sum

	[$ \sum_{i,j} a_i \times b_j = (\sum_i a_i) \times (\sum_j b_j)]
It looks like a special law, but it's just a lot of [distribution laws].
ã€€Distribution law: [$ a \times b + a \times c = a \times (b + c)]

More use [formal power series] (corresponding to an infinite sequence of numbers) for infinite sums
	[$ \sum_i^\infty x^{ai} \times \sum_j^\infty x^{bj} = \sum_i^\infty\sum_j^\infty x^{ai+bj}]
