>If you just say, "It's easier to explain your proposal if you have [a prototype]," will people misunderstand that prototypes are made in a text-format programming language?
>It doesn't matter if it's Scratch, NoCode, or [paper prototype https://uxmilk.jp/75270]!
>You can use any tool you want, but you have to make it go from being "only in your brain" to "a state you can show to others," show it to multiple people and observe their reactions (reactions will vary from person to person), and don't be discouraged if the reactions are poor ([it's up to you to make the best of your idea or kill it]).
