For the sixth question, I got to the point where I could use a phoenix tree, so I implemented naive and then made a phoenix tree version and submitted it, but the answers didn't match, and with 2 minutes left to go after checking the discrepancy between naive and phoenix for random inputs, I thought, "The naive method is wrong in the first place!" with 2 minutes left.

Still, the rate is going up, so I guess E was blue difficulty too. I simply had to divide, but when finding the inverse in mod P, I got stuck in a place where I couldn't use Fermat's minor theorem unless P was prime. I had to go back to the extended Euclidean method.
