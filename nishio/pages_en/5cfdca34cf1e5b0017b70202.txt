Publish a draft
	There are publish and wipe states in [esa].
		wip: work in progress, [draft].
	I recommend publishing it on WIP.
	Publication on wip is not [notified].

If there is no publication in WIP and the publication is immediately notified, two different cultures can occur
	Don't publish something unfinished, you get a notice, you go to read it, it's unfinished, you're wasting your time."
	"Keep publishing them, even if they're not finished, but no one will see the notices because they're useless, and let me know separately when they're finished."
Neither is very desirable.

Similar to [kintone] 2 way notifications
	Notices to you" are those that you need to see, and "other notices" are those that you do not need to see.
	You don't have to see it, but you can.

So you go further and have "I don't get notifications, but I can see them"?
	I thought about it and found it in kintone.
		You will not be notified of posts in public spaces that you do not follow, but you can see them.
		Search and other hits

[Scrapbox] also recommends publishing in draft form
	But the notification area is far from sophisticated.
