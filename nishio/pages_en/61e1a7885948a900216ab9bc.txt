Static hosting is a false dichotomy
Static or dynamic hosting" is a phenomenon that [draws on past dichotomies

Before JavaScript was used as it is today, it was easy to understand the conflict structure.
　Static: Typically delivers the contents of a file as is. Same content no matter who accesses it.
　Dynamic: typically Perl CGI or PHP, a program is executed on the server, content is generated in memory, and it is delivered. Content varies depending on who accesses it.

Increased demand for dynamic, person-to-person content delivery
Server load became an issue.
 Improvements in JavaScript speed and as a language have made it possible to run large JavaScript programs on the client side
 Emergence of CDNs: Caching static content for faster delivery and to avoid concentrated server load

This has led to an approach that tries to create a dynamic experience for the user, but with as static a delivery as possible.
The development of services that provide authentication and database functions via APIs has created a situation where "a dynamic experience is provided to the user, but none of the server-side programs
　The term serverless is sometimes used to refer to this

A typical use case requiring server-side processing in today's world of this technology is the support of the [Open Graph Protocol
　It is necessary to create HTML and images that are "static" in the sense that they "do not change depending on the user" and "dynamic" in the sense that they are "generated by a program on the server" for crawlers that do not run JavaScript.
　This can be cached by CDNs.
