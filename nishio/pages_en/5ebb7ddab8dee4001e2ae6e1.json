Words are variable names

　[Variable name] points to an entity in memory.
　The [word] points to an entity in the same way.
　　For lack of a better word for this "entity," I'll call it a "concept," which is somewhat incongruous.
　An entity can be a function definition, a class, or an instance of a class.
　On the human side, entities are abstract concepts and concrete experiences.
　　I guess the discomfort is this: it doesn't feel right to call the experience a "concept".
　Both entities are intricately interlinked.
　　So it's difficult to cut it out and tell others.
　Variable names are just labels for entities, so multiple names may be attached to the same entity.
　The same variable name may point to different entities.
　What is pointed to may vary depending on timing.
　　Short variables are temporary
　　Global variables have longer names.
