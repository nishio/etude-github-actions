>The 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Leonid Hurwitz, Eric Maskin, and Roger Myerson for "fundamental contributions to mechanism design theory.
[Maskin's theorem]

[Definition of Strategic Resistance]

Correspondence with [game theory] (→<correspondence source concept>)
　Each individual [$ i \in I ] has a set of messages [$ \mathscr{D}_i ] (→ preference space)
　Each individual strategically chooses a message [$ \succsim_i \in \mathscr{D}_i ](→preference)
 The function [$ f ] that gives the consequence determines the consequence of the game [$ f(\succsim)\in X
　Counter-strategy means that the true preference group itself is the [dominant strategic equilibrium] in this game.
　[direct game]: [$ (\succsim, \mathscr{D}, f)]
　[direct mechanism]: [$ (\mathscr{D}, f)]

No distinction is made between the ideal to be realized ([social choice function]) and the method used to guide it ([direct mechanism]).
　I would like to distinguish this
　Also, [dominant strategy equilibrium] is a kind of [solution concept], but it is difficult to handle, so I would like to extend it to handle general solution concepts.

Set of messages [$ M_i]
Pair of messages [$ m \equiv (m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n) \in M_I \equiv M_1 \times M_2 \times \cdots \times M_n]
Function to choose a consequent for a pair of messages (consequent function) [$ g: M_I \to X].
[$ M \equiv (M_i)_{i\in I}]
Mechanism (indirect mechanism): [$ (M, g)] #Definition of mechanism
Direct mechanism: [$ M_i = \mathscr{D}_i, g = f]
Game [$ (\succsim, M, q)] for true preference pair [$ \succsim \in \mathscr{D}_I ]
Mechanisms are generators that give games to each true preference.
mechanism
Consider a certain correspondence S as a [solution concept] of the game
	[$ S(\cdot, M,g) : \mathscr{D}_I \twoheadrightarrow M_I]

[$ g(S(\succsim, M, g)) \equiv \{x \in X : \exists m\in S(\succsim, M, g), x = g(m) \} = F(\succsim)]

[Non-Vetoability]
　If Gian, with the help of Dekisugi's suggestion, says, "Let's all share Suneo's New Year's money equally!" Nobita has no reason to oppose it.
　Suneo can't refuse to object alone.
