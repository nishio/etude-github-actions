Importing a portion of a map into another map
	A balloon menu appears in the group and you can select "Import to other maps", and when you select it, you get a list of other maps in the updated order, and when you select it, that map opens and is imported.
	Select" -> Balloon menu -> Select import destination -> Open as selected

New maps available.
	Write on one page in Scrapbox and then select "new page" to create a new page.
 In Regroup, "Select and Group" creates a group and closes it.
 But maybe "select and new map" could be used to put the sticky on a different map.
 The problem of too many stickies becoming too heavy.
 Compared to opening and closing groups, the transition is inevitably slower because data must be fetched from the server.
