 What is [For Eternal Peace]/[Enlightenment] and 3 others
	[Kant] [Nakayama, Hajime]

	Kant's ideas about [Enlightenment] are concentrated.
 > What is Enlightenment?
 > It is a way for people to get out of the [underage state] that they have brought on themselves.
 > The state of being a minor means that one is unable to use one's reason without the direction of others.
 > Man is in a state of infancy, not because he lacks [reason], but because he cannot have [the determination to use his reason] or the courage to do so without the direction of others!
 > So man remains a minor in his own responsibility.

	I'm talking about the need for [the decision] to act based on one's own reason.
