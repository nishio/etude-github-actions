 I'll write a detailed explanation later, but for now, after two hours of sutra chanting, I was able to get the LED to light up. I'm an amateur, so I may be wrong.
 
 Wired wrong.

 The I/O from USB is wrong: IN is stuck to RESET and OUT is stuck to IN. I didn't realize it was wrong because I didn't send anything from the PC.

 memo
 - Resistance is now square instead of zigzag.
 - Cathode sticks negative, long leg positive, short leg negative.
 - digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); or something like that.
 - blink sample is port 13, leg 19 in IC
 - To PWM, it has to be an analog leg (even though it's an analog leg, it's just PWM inside).
 - PWM ready
 - They told me to Google LM386.
 - I am looking at the data sheet for the LM386. Amplifier first time.
 - Sounded!

 - Read the YMZ294 briefing document
 - There's a sample called Melody, and id:inajob is easily shedding glittering stars.
 - Inputs that would be open are in undefined state, so pull them up. Pull up by default and drop to ground.
 - The specific model number of the AVR series made by Atmel is ATmega168, and the Arduino with it is Arduino NG Diecimila

 The analog input pins can be used as digital pins, referred to as numbers 14 (analog input 0) to 19 (analog input 5).

 - It's a lot of wiring http://twitpic.com/a0mk2
 
 - I wrote 0x1111 when I should have written 0b1111 and so on.
 
 - I'll leave a picture of it so that I can restore it in case it gets broken in the process of leaving.

 I'm back. I took a video of what I made yesterday and today and put it on YouTube. I'll write the explanation or something later because I'm very tired from eyestrain: http://bit.ly/p814T
