	I mentioned it in the line link, so I cut it out.


This "helplessness" part, another abstraction, is "an assumption contrary to the fact that 'I can't do it.'"
	Isn't that [a policy constraint]?
	Thinking something "can't be done" or [unconsciously eliminating it as an option].
	This can be a case of "physical constraints" that really can't be done physically, or it can be a "policy constraint" that people just think it is.
	By clarifying the reasons for "I can't," once we get to the policy constraints, we may be able to change the constraints themselves.
	First of all, there is the state of not being able to verbalize "I can't" and unconsciously excluding it as an option.
 Next, there is a state of being able to verbalize "I can't do it," but not being able to verbalize the reason why.
 As I verbalize the reason, I see a constraint. We think these constraints are unchangeable, but are they really unchangeable?
→[deconstructing the forces that impede change].
