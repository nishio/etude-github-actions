		The "link things that are close together" system we created yesterday: [link creation support].
		It is the same as the [Curiosity Module] written in [Subjectivity and Emotion], up to the point where the distance between past memories is calculated.
			The "Curiosity Module" is not a separate page at this time, but should become one eventually.
		Now it's a simple Euclidean distance, but when using cosine similarity, it takes the same form as inner product attention.
			Then, as I wrote in [dimensionality reduction note], you can make a distant association by putting Dropout
		It seems relevant to this that I excluded the ones where the vectors are equal.

		Reflecting on [nodal point of thought 20191021].
		Picking up the closest past memory from the new input and linking to it is "associative" where the pickup is "associative" and stocked with
			[Stock in associations]
		If we can describe what would be desirable, we may be able to acquire measures

		What we haven't done yet
	  I am able to find the closest memory Y for input X, but when I observe myself I am doing "reading both and making new outputs with that stimulus", how can this process be achieved?

	  		Associative [pointing] is a primitive form of output

					If the contents are combined in a different arrangement than originally given, the corresponding vectors will naturally be different.
						The act of selecting and pointing to the closest content from this new vector is "the act of outputting a new combination of content as input.
		There are 2^768 ways to do a Dropout in 768 dimensions, so a full search is practically impossible; if X and Y are associated under a certain Dropout and the connection is beneficial, it suggests that "that Dropout way is a beneficial abstraction".
			So the connection of two points, "the connection of X and Y", is another data point one layer above, so that should be stocked too!
