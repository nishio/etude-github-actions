Fast test cycles
In a nutshell, "small and frequent testing helps speed up the learning cycle."

>In school exams, you cannot review the text during the exam. You can't input during the output. Programming is different. If you are writing a program and get stuck on, for example, "What is the instruction for concatenating strings? If you are writing a program and get stuck, for example, "What is the instruction to combine strings? Then, the input information is immediately used to write the rest of the program.  In other words, each line of programming is a small test. If you can't remember something from the test, you immediately input it. And if you can't remember something from the test, you immediately input it.
> Immediately afterwards, you actually use that knowledge to write a program. They output, then immediately input, then immediately output again using the results. It is a very fast learning and testing cycle.
