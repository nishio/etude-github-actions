	I don't feel it works that well.
 The value gained "I see! is usually out of the chat phase.
 	It's summarized in a state of text after the chat.
 	There's no new value added by chopping them up and arranging them on a sticky note.
 In this experiment, I'm making it a sticky after the chat is over.
 	If they were simultaneous, there could be a synergistic effect.
	 Was there no room for new developments since the "awareness of blind spots" caused by arranging stickies was already done by the chat?
		If the chat logs were in a state of "I think I see something interesting here, but I don't know what it is", I could have discovered it by chopping it up and arranging it
 	 This time, it had already been unearthed.

 	Many of the stickies are still a little too long at this point.
 	Am I glad I didn't do the merging of contiguous chunks?

 If you use it from your phone, the current chat UI is better than the Regroup which requires a bigger screen.
	 If used from a PC, it would be better to add a "look at the current map and have the bot ask questions" feature to Regroup
	 Longer typed or spoken responses to questions should be inscribed and added as stickies
