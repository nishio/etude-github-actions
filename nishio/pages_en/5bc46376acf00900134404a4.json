They both look funny to me.
	[Knowledge is a good that belongs to the individual, so "grow it" is synonymous with "give me money.
 	It's crazy to think you can get it just by claiming it.
  If you want to draw investment in nurturing, you need to explain the benefits of that investment.
  If you can't give it to them, they have to grow up on their own.
  You don't have the option of not growing up because you can't give it to them, it's only a loss to you.
  I am responsible for my own development see [I am responsible for my own productivity].
 You can raise them and they can quit."
 	Being able to quit is the problem in the first place.
  Knowledge is a good that belongs to the individual, so it is lost to the company when he quits. Naturally.
  Changing jobs involves costs of finding a new job, etc.
  A situation where the person who raised you pays that cost and then moves on to a new job.
  Grown-up talent is given only inferior treatment compared to their market value.
