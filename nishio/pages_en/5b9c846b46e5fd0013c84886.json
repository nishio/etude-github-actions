		>I don't mind duplicates.
	 >Some people worry that if they spread out the writing method over time, they will write the same thing over and over again. Duplication is fine. In fact, don't even think about avoiding duplication. If you try to avoid duplication, you will end up in a situation where you cannot write a new entry until you have checked the previous ones, which will make your task bigger.
	 >To begin with, if I wrote 100 pages and later sorted through them and found three pages with the same content, what real harm would there be? I know that I felt it was very important because I, being separated in time, independently thought "this should be written" at each time. Duplication is a useful indicator of importance. Duplication of exactly the same content is useful, but duplication of similar but slightly different content is even more useful. It gives you an opportunity to think about what is common and what is different. As we discussed in Chapter 2, comparisons of similar but slightly different things can help build understanding.
