Deviation from the mean and sample size
 [Daniel Kahneman] "[Fast & Slow] - How do you determine your intentions?"
 >(p. 160) "A study of the incidence of serious kidney disease in 3,141 counties across the United States found a striking [pattern]. Most of the counties with low incidence rates are in rural areas of the Midwest, South, and West, with low population densities and traditionally Republican strongholds."
	However, the same characteristics are also present in areas where the rate of occurrence is high.
 Low population density = small sample size This is just the result of "deviation from the average".
