Scrapbox and Project Management
	False for "Scrapbox cannot be used for project management".
 	Scrapbox itself, because the development project is done in Scrapbox.

 Scrapbox is suitable for project management" is unclear definition of project management
 	If we follow the [PMBOK], which is the general textbook for [project management], project management is
  	Manage projects to completion in a given amount of time
   Management to complete the project within the approved budget
   Management to identify and acquire the resources needed for the project
  Concepts including
  Scrapbox development projects appear to be executed by a small group of people and without clear deadlines
			Hardly an actual example of project management in the PMBOK sense.

So, whether or not Scrapbox is suited for PMBOK-style project management, let's put aside the question of whether or not Scrapbox is suited for PMBOK-style project management,
In a "Scrapbox development" type of in-house development project with a small number of people working on it for a long period of time with no clear deadline,
I have a feeling that perhaps I am very well suited to manage with Scrapbox.

Scrapbox-type management is a possible third force.
	PMBOK has a rather [waterfall] element.
	If we look at it from the perspective of "waterfall ⇔ [agile]", Scrapbox's development project is not waterfall, so it seems to be agile, but it is also different from the so-called agile methodology #False dichotomy
 Seems to take a negative position on time pressure such as iteration, velocity, etc.

 	According to Drucker, "[knowledge worker productivity] cannot be measured," but agile methods attempt to measure and manage it.

What [should be made]?"
	There is no point in efficiently implementing something that should not be created.

	Management of software development using Scrapbox could be very useful in determining "[what] to build"
	do something this way
