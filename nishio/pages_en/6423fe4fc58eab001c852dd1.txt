　1: As the size of the organization grows, one person cannot handle the information generated by each individual.
　2: So people created [a hierarchical structure] #Hierarchical organization
　　Middle management is the information intermediary structure.
　　Information from top management is conveyed to subordinates by middle management, and information from subordinates is summarized by middle management and conveyed to top management.
　　This allowed the organization to expand in size, but slow and distorted information transfer became a problem.
　3A: The development of information transmission methods has made it easier to deliver information issued by top management to all employees.
　3B: But even in this era, top management cannot handle all information, so middle management is needed
　　The problem of slow and distorted information gathered at the top still remained.
　4: Natural language summary creation by LLMs will bring information to the top without human intervention.
　　From the top, "I can see things I couldn't see well before [glasses]" and "[the ability to see a wide area]."
　　From the bottom, could the top come looking at any time [panopticon]?
　　Since it is the top management that feels this is most necessary, the introduction of a system to make this possible is promoted from the top down.

The power of technology will make obsolete the "dynamics of creating a [Brown organization]" as described in the "[teal organization]" and accelerate changes in organizational structure.

Considerations that have not yet been put together
　Will the "glasses to see the whole organization well" that the top management has acquired be given to many of the employees as well?
　　There is an issue of [access rights], different people have different "information" that they are allowed to see.
　　Needs are high.
　　　Absorbed by human artisans with special talents doing [in-house information curator].
　　　It takes "information to which everyone has access" as input and produces one type of "for everyone" curated output
　　　This is where [diversity production] comes in, depending on individual access rights and interests.
