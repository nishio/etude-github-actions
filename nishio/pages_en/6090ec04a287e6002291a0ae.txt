 >>
 (Samsung) has stopped following Japan in terms of business strategy. It has abandoned the strategy of competing with Japanese manufacturers in developed markets. It has entered the emerging markets.
 
 Japanese manufacturers consider the moment a product is sold as consumption. In reality, consumption occurs only when the product is operated. User satisfaction is obtained through the consumption of the operation of the product by using the implemented functions. Japanese makers call Korean makers' products under-quality, but for users in emerging countries, Japanese products with many functions that are not consumed are over-quality.
 
 Qualitative qualities such as "quietness" and "durability" are difficult to pursue and lead to higher development costs.

 It kind of reminded me of a story I read in Drucker about when Sony made the transistor radio when the US was looking only at tube radios.
