mathematical capitalism
>Mathematical capitalism" has the meaning of "an economic system in which mathematics is the source of national wealth ([capitalism])" as well as "a way of thinking that emphasizes human resources in the fields of science and mathematics as capital ([mathematical capital]). The country that builds a new management and social system suitable for "mathematical capitalism" in both of these senses will be the winner of the fourth industrial revolution.
[A report on a meeting for exchanging opinions on the activities of science and mathematics personnel in industry, "The Age of Mathematical Capitalism: The Power of Mathematics Will Change the World", has been compiled (METI/Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) https://www.meti.go.jp/press/2018/03/20190326005/ 20190326005.html]

I understood that "[knowledge capitalism]", which does not limit capital to monetary items but considers knowledge to be capital as well, has been well known for a long time, but "mathematical capitalism" is more clearly defined as "human resources who have mathematical knowledge are capital".
