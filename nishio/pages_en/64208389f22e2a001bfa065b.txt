 The Debate on English as an Official Language: During the Meiji Era, there was a debate on whether or not English should be an official language. This was seen as a means to improve international communication and to promote modernization more rapidly.
 Opposition: However, there was a strong opinion that it is desirable to maintain Japanese as the official language in order to preserve Japanese culture and traditions.
 The end result: English did not become the official language and Japanese continued to be used as the official language. However, English education continued in domestic schools and played an important role in international exchange and business.
[nishio.icon]Briefly itemize the opinions of those in favor and those opposed.
[gpt.icon]Pros:.
  Improved international communication: English as an official language will facilitate international exchange and business.
  Accelerated modernization: Japan's modernization was accelerated as it became easier to incorporate Western technology and knowledge.
  Improved quality of education: With English as the official language, more emphasis will be placed on English education and the English proficiency of the population will improve.
  Promote interaction with foreigners: English as an official language will make it easier for foreigners to live in Japan and increase diversity.
 Opposition:.
  Preservation of culture and traditions: Maintaining Japanese as an official language will protect Japanese culture and traditions.
  National Identity: Maintaining Japanese as an official language is important for maintaining national pride and identity.
  Language maintenance and development: Maintaining the status of the Japanese language will encourage its maintenance and development.
  Practicality issue: Making English the official language may disadvantage citizens who are not fluent in Japanese.
[nishio.icon]Suppose there is an AI that is smarter than humans and that AI is better at English. Think step-by-step how it could think in this environment.
[gpt.icon]Assessing the role of AI: If an AI smarter than humans exists and is good at English, we first need to assess its role and impact.
 AI diffusion status: To investigate whether AI is widely used and to determine the extent to which its influence is felt in Japan.
 Human-AI interaction: consider how humans and AIs work and communicate together. Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of humans communicating with AI in English if English is a strong suit for AI.
 Spread of English: Consider [* the possibility of further increasing the use of English in Japan] as AI becomes more proficient in English. Consider the importance of English education and how it will affect the frequency of English use in business and daily life.
 　I sympathize with this one [nishio.icon].
 Improve Japanese AI technology: While AI, which is smarter than humans, excels in English, we will also work to improve Japanese AI technology. This will allow AI to provide efficient communication and services while maintaining Japanese as the official language.
 　This is another controversial one[nishio.icon].
 Maintaining Culture and Identity: Examine how AI's proficiency in English will affect Japanese culture and identity. Consider how to preserve and develop Japanese traditions and culture as English becomes increasingly popular.
 Final Decision: Consider all of the above factors and decide whether to make English the official language or maintain the current policy of Japanese as the official language; take into account the need for flexibility as AI evolves and society changes; consider whether to make English the official language or maintain the current policy of Japanese as the official language.
[nishio.icon]Abstract the above discussion and express it as a relationship between objects.
[gpt.icon]Object A: AI smarter than humans
 Object B: English
 Object C: Japanese
 Object D: Japanese culture and identity
 Object E: Use and dissemination of English in Japan
 Object F: Japanese AI Technology
 Object G: Official Language Policy
 Relation:.
 A excels at B.
 A and humans interact and communicate with each other.
 The presence of A affects E.
 E can affect G.
 The presence of A may affect the improvement of F.
 G is important to protect and develop D.
 Progress in E and F should influence the choice of G.
[nishio.icon][Suggest an analogy for a structure similar to this composition].
[gpt.icon]Object A: Electric car (electric car)
 Object B: Photovoltaics
 Object C: Petroleum
 Object D: Automotive Industry
 OBJECT E: Diffusion of renewable energies
 Object F: Gasoline engine technology
 Object G: Energy Policy
 Relation:.
 A uses B to obtain power.
 A and humans interact with each other and are used as a means of transportation.
 The presence of A affects E.
 E can affect G.
 The presence of A may affect the improvement of F.
 G is important to protect and develop D.
 Progress in E and F should influence the choice of G.
 In this analogy, electric cars are to AI smarter than humans, solar power is to English, oil is to Japanese, the auto industry is to Japanese culture and identity, renewable energy is to English use and diffusion, gasoline engine technology is to Japanese AI technology, and energy policy is to official language policy corresponds to the Japanese culture and identity. Through this analogy, we can consider the question of how new technologies and environmental changes affect traditional industries and cultures, and how policy should respond to these developments.

In fact, yes.

Protect Japanese culture! and the generation that grew up surrounded by English videos and games and conversing daily with an AI that is better at English, I can see them having the same kind of discussion they are having now with married couples.
