If someone asks you "How many bytes of double-byte characters?" and you answer without checking what those "double-byte characters" are, you're making some kind of unspoken assumption.

I'm feeling like "I'm not sure which one can increase the number of bytes". I'm feeling like this.

　　Use the definition that a user-recognized "[* character]" is a [grapheme cluster

　I think it would be better to use "East Asian width" for the definition of full-width and half-width.

Well, but he's running away from home, but the cursor moves four people at once, so if you argue that "it may look like two letters, but it's one letter because it's one grapheme cluster..."

code:python
 >>> print(b"\xE2\x80\x8D".join([b"\xF0\x9F\x91\xA8", b"\xF0\x9F\x91\xA9"] * 10).decode("utf-8"))

I think you mean this one letter.
