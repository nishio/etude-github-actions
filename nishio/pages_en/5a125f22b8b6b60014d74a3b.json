Nurture subordinates

---
It was interesting to hear a friend talk about how to train subordinates, so I considered it.

Assume the following assumptions
	The subordinate's current abilities are inferior to yours across the board and "[it would be] faster if I did it myself".
 Subordinates' strengths are different from their own
 You have some control over what your subordinates learn.

There are three different policies on what to study.
[https://gyazo.com/403868ef30e6def7eabde59d540c16a4]
	A: Let [weakness be overcome].
 B: Teach [what you are good at].
 C: Develop the opponent's [strengths].

	A: Allow them to overcome their weaknesses
  Raise the overall bottom line by focusing on developing the weakest areas
  It will be a form of training generalists see #Specialists and generalists
  When your overall ability has grown enough to exceed your general ability, you can concentrate on your strengths and delegate other things to that person.
  demerit
  	Time cost to become a useful resource is quite high
   Difficulty in maintaining motivation because they are forced to do only what they are not good at.
 B: Teach what you are good at
  Teach what you know best so you can learn more efficiently.
  	In the figure, I wrote C higher, but B is more likely to be higher.
  Beneficial when you are short of your own resources and need a clone who can work in your place
  demerit
  	High time cost until the education target reaches a level where it can be replaced by you because it is where you are strongest.
 C: Developing the strengths of the other party
  Stretch out where the opponent is strong at the moment
   From the standpoint of [comparative advantage], it is justifiable to swing the task where the opponent is strong.
  If it doesn't clearly exist, then by being biased in the type of work you do, you create a situation where you are relatively more knowledgeable about that type of work than others, and extend that as a strong point.
		Easy to motivate
  It is possible to create a situation where the other party performs better than you with respect to their area of expertise, at a low cost.
  [productivity improvement] through delegation will work.
  demerit
  	The strengths of the other party will determine the areas to be developed, so it is not always possible to develop what is convenient for us.


My friend told me that C "is the right way to develop strengths". I summarized the three different methods and the advantages and disadvantages of each for comparison. I too think C > B > A.
