 *1477729715*minimum *** product(MVP) V is Viable, not Valuable
 The <a href="http://amzn.to/2eS66SK">Lean Startup</a> says: "MVP in this book refers to a product that uses a build-measure-learn feedback loop to begin the learning process. MVPs in this book are products that allow you to start a learning process using a build-measure-learn feedback loop. For more information, see (link below)."

 The word "viable" is a synonym for feasible and means "realizable." see: <a href='http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/viable?q=viable'> Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</a>
 
 It is the customer who decides whether a product is valuable or not, not you as a creator. Therefore, in order to verify "whether the customer thinks the product is valuable or not," the creator should make a minimum viable product and learn from the customer's reaction.
