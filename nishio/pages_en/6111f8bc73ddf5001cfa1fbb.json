Cognitive Distortions and Human Bugs
I've been using the terms [cognitive distortion] and [human bug] vaguely to refer to similar concepts, but maybe I should clarify the boundaries.

The fact is X, but some people fail to recognize that it is X, and they perceive that it is Y.
　This is a cognitive distortion.
　Metaphor where the robot's camera sensor gets bent and decides that what is in front of it is not in front of it and acts on it, causing a collision.

Because of the connection between the trachea and the esophagus, drinks get into the lungs and make you gag.
　This is a human bug.
　We have had strange implementations that have caused inconveniences when a more appropriate design could have been in place.

Once beneficial, but not in today's context.
　Like how the body tries to store fat right away.
　[People continue with nonsensical procedures] and so on.
　We have called these human bugs, but are they bugs?
　　You just haven't been able to update your specs to meet changing circumstances.

Bugs can be beneficial at times (image of bug technique)
　[Bug or ability?]
