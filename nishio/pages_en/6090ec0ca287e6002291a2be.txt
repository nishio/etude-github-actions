 *1379147363* Apology and correction for error in "Motivational Systems 5000 Users Celebration Entry".
 Two weeks ago when I wrote "<a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20130901/1378024177'>Motivational Systems 5000 User Milestone Entry</a>", I thought the number of users was 5201. but that was the number of visits to the start page. Of those, 3461 were people who had started using the system. It was an error to say that the number of users exceeded 5,000, and we hereby apologize and make the correction.
 
 Thanks to your support, at this time we have 10615 visitors, of which 6876 have started using the system.
 
 Of the 6876 users, 3583, or 52%, were motivated. The "about 40%" in the above entry was based on a gross misunderstanding of the number of users.
