I thought the vote would be more divided since it was not a mistake to choose any of them, but reduce just barely won a majority.

reduce
	Name of a function in Python that repeatedly performs binary operations on a sequence of values to produce a single value
	Same in Lisp

inject
	Name of a method in Ruby that repeats a binary operation on a sequence of values to produce a single value
	Smalltalk origin
	[map and collect, reduce and inject -- the difference in ideas in the difference in names. https://magazine.rubyist.net/articles/0038/0038-MapAndCollect. html]

prod
	When the binary operation is not specified, it is often assumed to be a multiplication.
		>Often the binary operation μ is also called multiplication in magma M. The result of this operation μ(a, b) is the product of a and b.

		Binary operations repeated on a sequence of values into a single value are [$ \prod x_i]
			TeX with `\prod x_i`.

fold
	>In functional programming, fold (also termed reduce, accumulate, aggregate, compress, or inject) refers to a family of higher-order functions that analyze a recursive data structure and through use of a given combining operation, recombine the results of recursively processing its constituent parts, building up a return value.
