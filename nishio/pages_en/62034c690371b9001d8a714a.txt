[Educated] with diverse [non-specialized knowledge].
>"A liberal arts program or general education that fails to integrate specialized knowledge into general knowledge is not liberal arts. It fails in its first duty as a liberal arts education: to bring about [mutual understanding], to [create] a world of dialogue, which is a condition for the existence of civilization" ([Post-Capitalist Society]).
