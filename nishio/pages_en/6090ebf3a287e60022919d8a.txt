 >>
 Today, Japanize extension (plug-in) for Internet Explorer is released.

 Even those using Internet Explorer can now use English services in Japanese. For now, I'll put it in my parents' machine and recommend YouTube to them.... Many people are put off by the fact that it's in English when I introduce a good service.

 When I created a test case by recording my browser operations, the number of topics is different between the data for testing and the data at the time of recording, so the URLs are shifted.

 I can't pick up the view in coverage testcoverage.py or figlieaf.py. I guess it's not tracing imports using strings. That's hard to do, and it's quite difficult to do without tracing the sys.path changes. But if I just want to check that my tests are being tested properly, I might as well embed the code to test coverage manually. Think about it.
 
 I forgot to publish today's bilingual data as early as today. I guess that's OK, since I got the subject.
 
 Distinction between subject and topic
 
 *1195236762*Sleepy Sleep
 We should sleep with our stomachs full!
 It is something that slips into the futon!
 
 Since it has already been three years, it is only natural that they should sleep!
 Therefore, we should sleep with our heads held high!
