Reverse Jenga reloading
I learned at [Unnamed Camp] that [even if].
　Comparing [constructive discussion] to [reverse Jenga
　　In regular [Jenga], the person who collapses loses.
　　Reverse Jenga keeps it from collapsing.
　　　If the goal is to stack without collapsing, it is beneficial to "re-stack" the pile so that it is less likely to collapse if someone else places it in a way that is likely to collapse.
