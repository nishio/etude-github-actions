It's different from [GAN], but the concept is to use both [generative model] and [discriminative model].
	1: First, train a generative model with selected sentences
 2: Next, the model is used to generate the same number of fake sentences as the original sentences to train a discriminative model.
 3: Select good sentences from a large number of sentences in that identification model.
I thought about the process of this.
