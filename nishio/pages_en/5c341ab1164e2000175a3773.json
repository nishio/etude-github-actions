How to give knowledge to those who lack knowledge
[https://gyazo.com/5eb0426fe50b1b9a28ea1f5c529f2575]

	Suppose Mr. A has some new concept X that he wants to communicate.
	For someone like Mr. B, who has enough buildup, you only need to tell him that X.
	But how do I tell Mr. C., who doesn't have that kind of buildup?
	Option 1
		I'll give you all the information you need.
		Best way for Mr. C.
		But most of the world's Mr. C's aren't willing to spend that much.
		By analogy, this is like a math book written around "what is an integer in the first place".
		Most people drop out before they get to the concept X they want to get.
		It's also extremely costly on the author's part.
		Constraints on publishing costs on the part of the publisher, such as physical page limits for paper books.
		So not a very realistic option to adopt.
	Option 2
		Only a minimal number of stories are loaded to get to concept X.
		Essentially, books provide a form of story that is abstracted and built up from multiple concrete experiences
		Can't support it well, but barely manages.
		The parts that could not be written in the book can be shown in the form of references, etc.
			I hate it when some publishers remove the reference list when it's time to translate a foreign book.
	Option 3
		By the author's [halo effect], I'm going to tell you to believe it anyway, because it's right.
