 Will you not let me do this?
 
 
 No, why be honest about it in the first place?

   {{ game.get_player(forloop.counter0) }}

 and won't you let me write it down?
 
 
 To put it in a way that other template people can understand, I want to do obj.method(forloop.counter0) in a loop for a certain array xs, using the information of how many it is now (forloop.counter0), or at least do ys[forloop.counter0 I want to do [forloop.counter0]".
 
 **1224606315*[Midterm] Midterm online with commentary.
 I made it display things like, "If we keep this up, we can win," or "How many points do we need to score to win?"

 In the meantime, it is possible to turn it on and off with Player attributes, but there is no form to change the attributes yet.
 
 
 I thought I would add a function to give advice based on game scores, and then give more advice based on round scores, but this changes considerably depending on the situation. I think it would be better to create NishioBot.
 - easy mode: "NishioBot's advice" appears next to the play screen.
 - normal mode: no advice given.
 - hard mode: opponent is NishioBot, not RandomAI
 It's like.
