git submodule
	Same as the one pocket principle, if you put the source code all over the place, it gets confusing, so you want to put it in one place.
 On the other hand, I'd like to make some of it public.
 Is git submodule correct?
 PyTorch or something. I did $ git clone --recursive and a bunch of repositories came down.
