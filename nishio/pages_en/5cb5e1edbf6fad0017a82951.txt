The Parable of the Ants, Spiders and Bees
> The empirical school is the way of [ants], who just collect and use. The rational school is the way of the spider, which makes a web out of itself. The bees, on the other hand, are in the middle, sucking up materials from the garden and wild flowers, but [transforming] and [digesting] them with their own power.
	[Francis Bacon] [Novum Organum] Aphorism 95
 [Empiricism] and Continental Rationalism

Not only must it be collected, it must be transformed and digested.
	What is digestion?
		[This is also bacon.
