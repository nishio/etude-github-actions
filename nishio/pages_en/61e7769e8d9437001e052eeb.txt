 I've been trying [Notion] lately.
 　Muscle training memo in [/nishio/Notion].
 　But in the end, as far as ease of "writing" is concerned, I found it easier to write in a single text area on a single page of Scrapbox
 　　I'm talking about if you don't try to separate pages or tag them for classification.
 　On the other hand, the Notion's refinement is useful to know things like "How many times did I do this exercise the last time I did it?
 　After thinking about this, I'm starting to think that the best way is to use UserScript or Scrapbox Reader to create a narrower focus.
 　　I'm thinking something like "find the tree that matches the line you're on and the number of characters at the beginning of the tree and balloon it from the top of the page."
 　　I think I can incremental search up to 5 lines from the top as fast as link search[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 　　 Can be retrieved in batches from [api/pages/:projectname
 　Scrapbox Reader can do too much of everything, my dreams are getting too big, I need to remember to get to the point...
 　　It's a use case where you want to check how many times you did it last time when you do a new muscle training and record it, so it's not Reader-friendly because it's a set of editing and...
 　　　So it's not even Scrapbox-oriented after all, or just "it's easier to write in one text box", there's no need for it to be Scrapbox.
 　　　Can I write it in one text box and have it split and put it in multiple records in Notion?

　　　If you rewrite the project name, you can try other projects and so on.
　　　Oh~[/villagepump/takker.icon]
　　　 early (in the day, etc.)
　　I've got it set to cache for 12 hours, so it'll probably shuffle out.
　　Hey, that's a buggy display from n years ago...
　　　Ah, I see, you mean "two years ago, in January 2020, the well didn't exist".
　　　Few pages were updated 2 years ago, so that pages from 1 year ago are mixed in when pages are ordered by proximity to 2 years ago -> FIXED DONE
　　Oh, there's a page that needs to be URIEncode `2021-01-18 Where to collaborate on UserScript/UserCSS` -> modified done
　I'm talking about "I want the ability to embed pages" and "I want to embed other pages."
　　I feel we could try to realize this experimentally on ScrapboxReader.
　　　When there is a link like `[embed:foo]`, render foo there.
　　　　Maybe make it a decoration so that people in environments without conversion tools can trace it, like `[> [foo]]`.
　　　Oops, I almost got sidetracked again.
　If you put [ScrapBubble] in Scrapbox Reader, you can use it in projects you are not participating in, even on a phone that you can't put extensions in()(side note).
  A suggested implementation of the [Scrapbox Reader] related page list was to show a popup like [scrapbox-card-bubble][/villagepump/takker.icon].
  　Yes, it would be nice to include something like that in the display of the related pages list, so that it can be used by general readers who don't have extensions or UserScript[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
  　　At first, I read that [ScrapBubble] was the latest version.
  　　Reading [/takker/takker99/ScrapBubble] -> install done
  　　Oh, thank goodness [takker.icon*2].
  　　 Might be moving a little slow these days.
  　　  I suspect I'm misusing React hooks and running a lot of re-renderings.
  　　  I'm looking for advice from someone strong in React today.

　　[Let's create a personal project before posting on the well#60f34ac2aff09e000008a655]
　　　When I'm writing for a one-person project, I often don't explain what I know about it.
　　　It's like trying to explain something switches your state of mind and creates a different chemical reaction in your mind than when you're writing alone.
　　　I think it's basically good to remove [unnecessary constraints] in putting into words what hasn't been put into words yet, but sometimes things are created by constraints...at what point should we switch?
　The reason I became active recently is a combination of the fact that the junior Scrapbox project is over and the frequency of updates to the junior Scrapbox project has dropped, and the fact that I'm working on a Scrapbox-related development project, so I thought I'd write about it in the well in addition to writing about it in my own project.
　　Maybe in May we will go back to the unexplored junior...
