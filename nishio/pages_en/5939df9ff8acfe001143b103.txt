Feeling of not having enough time
I feel like I don't have enough time no matter how I think about it, but it's not that I don't have enough time physically, but that [frustration] of not having enough time prevents [concentration], or [dependency of tasks] increases by thinking to proceed [efficiently] due to lack of time, or tasks in progress increase.... Suspicion that [task dependencies] increase and work-in-progress tasks increase by trying to proceed [efficiently] because time is short.
