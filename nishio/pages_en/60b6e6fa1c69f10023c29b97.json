The ability to produce X is more valuable than X itself.
A generalization of the story that people who generate only a few ideas estimate the value of their ideas too high.
　Original topic [ideas and scarcity].

Is it better to buy a certain good X in the market or to make it yourself?
　This depends on the nature of the goods.
　All the things that are readily available in supermarkets are characterized as "better to buy at the market", which has accelerated the division of labor and settled into its current form.
　Effective solutions to the problems I want to solve are often not available in supermarkets
　　In this case, we have no choice but to take expensive measures such as hiring people who can generate solutions
　　Side note: As I was writing this, I realized that "a hypothesis that might solve the problem" and "a solution that has been verified to solve the problem" are two different things to begin with.
　　　A solution is worth more than a mere hypothesis.
