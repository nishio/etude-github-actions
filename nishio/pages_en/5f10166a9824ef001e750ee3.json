general term of a sequence
I have chewed up [yukicoder No.42 Sigh of the piggy bank | maspy's HP https://maspypy.com/yukicoder-no-42-%e8%b2%af%e9%87%91%e7%ae%b1%e3%81%ae%e6%ba%9c%e6%81%af] for my own understanding. I chewed it up for my own understanding.

When a formal power series F is of the form
[$ F = \frac{P}{(1-x^N)^M}]
The sequence of numbers for which this power series is taken by skipping N corresponding sequences
[$ \{{[x^{r+iN}]F}\} \quad (0 \le r < N) ]
The general term of can be expressed by the M-1st order equation

explanation
[$ P = p_0 + p_1 x + p_2 x^2 + p_3 x^3 + \ldots]
each term of x is classified by the remainder of the order of x divided by N.
 Example of N=2
 	[$ p_0 +  p_2 x^2 +  \ldots] 
 	[$ p_1 x + p_3 x^3 + \ldots = x(p_1 + p_3 x^2 + \ldots) ] 
Express this in terms of N new proper series [$ P_r
 Example of N=2
		[$ P_0(x^2)] 
		[$ xP_1(x^2)] 
		Representation in number sequences
		[$ P_0: \{p_0, p_2, \ldots \} ] 
		[$ P_1: \{p_1, p_3, \ldots \} ] 

Since [$ P = \sum_r x^r P_r(x^N)]
[$ F = \sum_r x^r \frac{P_r(x^N)}{(1-x^N)^M} ]
 Example of N=2
		[$ F = \frac{P_0(x^2)}{(1-x^2)^M} + x\frac{P_1(x^2)}{(1-x^2)^M} ] 

Represent F in terms of a new N power series Fr
[$ F_r(x) = \frac{P_r(x)}{(1-x)^M}]
[$ F(x) = \sum_r x^rF_r(x^N)]
I don't know from here.
　I'd have to do the math on a real example to get the M-1st order formula.
 　For terms above the order of P.
