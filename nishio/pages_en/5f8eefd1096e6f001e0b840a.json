　Thoughts.
　　If you actually rearrange and check, etc., you obviously won't be able to do it in time, so some kind of saving is necessary.
　　When the side is odd, all letters except the center are even or have even numbers; when the side is even, all letters have even numbers.
　　I'm just trying to determine if it exists or not, so why not just count the frequency and see if it's even or odd?
　Official Explanation
　　Overlooking the problem condition, it is a palindrome, even vertically.
　　The same case can be made for whether the vertical is odd or even, and the number of letters needed for one, two, or four can be determined.
