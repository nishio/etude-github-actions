There is no "everyone."
>Everyone," "the company," and "the country" do not exist. What exists is a diverse group of people, each with different personalities. Do not run away from facing each and every one of them. Do not be deceived by those who say they are doing it for the good of everyone, the good of the company, or the good of the country.
 >>It's interesting to see a site called Cybozu Style, where there is a lot of talk about "abandoning the idea of 'everyone'". Management, work style, internal events. If you think of each person as an entity with a name, there is no "way to please everyone. It's important not to run away from "everyone.

The idea of "[there is no company]" has gone one step further to "[everyone] doesn't exist."
