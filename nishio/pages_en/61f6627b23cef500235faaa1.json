Know Yourself
lxxxix 

Know yourself in your talents and abilities, in your judgments and tendencies. If you do not know yourself, you cannot master yourself. The face has a mirror, but the mind does not. Thinking carefully about oneself is the substitute. If you forget your outer image, maintain, improve, and perfect your inner image. Know your intellectual and clerical abilities, test your courage to make use of them, and keep a firm foundation and clear head in everything you do.
