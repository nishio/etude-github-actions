There are two types of task management
The term [task management] is ambiguous and has at least two meanings. It means "managing what a clear task looks like" and "[crystallizing] a task" out of the mumbo-jumbo that is not yet clear.

 There are two things that are called [task management].
		Task [progress] and resource management
			[task status management].
		　Dedicated tools are better.
		　　Scrapbox is not designed for it.
		　How to do it with Scrapbox
		　　[updated status indication should be a pictogram at the beginning of the title].
		Thinking about the task itself
　　　What is the problem and how to solve it
　　　[What to make]
			I prefer Scrapbox.
				why?
					There are so many things involved, I can't do it without writing it down and looking at it.
					Inconvenient for tools that assume one-dimensional communication
					It's the same story here, that state management tools for tasks (things that have been decided what to do and how to do it) don't fit because they are not designed to support the process of deciding "what to do".
