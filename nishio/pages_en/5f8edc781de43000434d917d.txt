　Thoughts.
　　In short, I want to count up the arrangement of K blue balls into i non-contiguous groups
　　At least one red ball between groups.
　　K blue balls into i non-contiguous groups
　　　[https://gyazo.com/95d89bbd307f278fd1788557b7742f0e]
　　	[$ b_i = \binom{K-1}{i-1}]
　　N-K red balls are divided into i+1 groups, but both ends can be zero
　　　[https://gyazo.com/7e203a9a37997fafc1062cd78ebda967]
			[$ r_i = \binom{N-K+1}{i}]
　　Now all we need to do is calculate K cases of this.
　　　Pre-calculate up to 2000 to speed up the process.
　Official Explanation
　　Policy OK
　　Since K is as small as 2000, they can use [Pascal's triangle] without pre-calculation.
	AC
		A naive implementation of the above policy could result in N - K - 1 < i in the calculation of ri.
		　Mathematically it is 0, but the implementation of the combination did not expect it and returned an incorrect value and WA'd.
		　I took care on the side of the library so as not to melt time with careless mistakes.
		code:python
		 def main():
       N, K = map(int, input().split())
       MOD = 1_000_000_007
       c = Combination(N, MOD)
       for i in range(1, K + 1):
           r = c.comb(K - 1, i - 1)
           r *= c.comb(N - K + 1, i)
           r %= MOD
           print(r)
