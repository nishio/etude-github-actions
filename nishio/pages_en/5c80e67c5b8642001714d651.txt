Additional column: Scrapbox
Put around after [/intellitech-en/4.3.3 Attention to headlines

	This book was initially produced as a paper book in Japanese
	In the process of creating the English version, I moved it to Scrapbox, a kind of wiki.
	I wrote that footnotes and columns are INTERSECTIONS
	In dealing with content on Scrapbox, a different kind of intersection was created, that of in-sentence links
	I wrote that sentences are one-dimensional, and that bullet points are more valuable than one-dimensional sentences because they maintain a tree structure.
	Content on Scrapbox maintains a networked structure that is not limited to a tree.
	closest to the structure of the author's brain.
