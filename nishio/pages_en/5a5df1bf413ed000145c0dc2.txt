Seniority and risk aversion
 [Risk aversion] is higher in favor in an environment where the majority of people are rewarded,
 In companies that have a [seniority-based] personnel system, where promotion is based on long-term tenure with the company, such people will be promoted, and in companies that do not have a seniority-based personnel system, such people will not be promoted,
 Suppress distribution and challenge of risky information (= new, uncertain information).
	This undermines the catch-up to new changes.

 Average orientation is advantageous in environments where the majority of people receive compensation: [average orientation is the worst environment].

  >It is not because Japan did not have that technology, but because when you try to introduce that technology, some people ask if it is safe, and they are not convinced even if you explain why it is technically safe. Such people have been observed many times, not only in this case but also in radiation and fish markets.
  The need for [safety] and [security] hinders the adoption of technology.
