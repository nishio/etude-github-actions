Import Hatena Diaries to Scrapbox with past dates
from [machine writes in Scrapbox].

Objective.
　When I search for Scrapbox, I don't get any hits on past blog posts, I think I should get a hit.
　It's automatically converted to Hatena blog, but I'm not paying for it, so I get ads.
　　I feel bad when I link them.
　I want to bracket past articles as well.

2021-05-04 [Hatena Diary] imported into Scrapbox with past dates [script https://github.com/nishio/scbot/blob/main/from_hatena.py]
2021-12-20
	Q: It's been six months.
 A: Very good
		[imported past blog posts into Scrapbox, six months, very good].

In the past (2018) I had even created a "script to convert exported XML to JSON in Scrapbox format".

　Why haven't you imported it into this project?
　Formatting is not fully supported.
　I didn't want the top of the page to be filled with mechanical articles.
　　→ I noticed that if you put the update date in the past, the top page won't be filled.

(computer) format
　It looks like the entity reference `&gt;` is being erased when I read it in bs4.
　　I don't think that's possible, but something lost came up and I'm not sure how to solve it.
　　It's not a big deal, so I parsed it on my own.
　No conversion from Hatena notation to Scrapbox notation
　　I put it all together and put it in Scrapbox code notation.
　　If it hits the search and you can read it, that's all that matters.
　　Do `html.unescape
　　I was going to use the title of the blog as the page title, but decided against it because I felt it wasn't necessary.
　　　All titles will be machine generated.
　　　Easy mechanical removal if you decide it's not good enough after import
　　　Q: Wouldn't it be better to make a backup before importing?
　　　A: If I want to undo the import after running the import for a while and editing various pages, I can't restore from a backup.
　　　Safe and secure override operation
	　　　It's sad when you update a script and re-convert it and it overwrites and loses the human written text.
　　　This anxiety prevents us from "keeping it updated".
　　　Don't change the machine-generated page, just create a page with a good title that can be duplicated when you want to change it.

　　The creation date and time are correctly set to three years ago.
　　But, well, it might have been enough to just say "not on the top page" without having to match the exact date and time of creation.

		2021-06-29 PS: I still prefer the current "date and time the article was actually written" because I'm comfortable with the search results being in chronological order.

search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)

I made a heading page but deleted it because I knew I would never use it.
