Concrete examples added to "Learning from Abstractions."
Added concrete examples to "[Learning from abstractions]" (from [Hatena2014-08-03] [How engineers learn])
	Chapter 3 of gihyo's version of "How Engineers Learn": [http://gihyo.jp/lifestyle/feature/01/engineer-studying/0003 Chapter 3: How to Understand Deeply - Compare, Learn from History, Learn by Making | gihyo.jp]
 in which we learned about the need for abstraction and how to do it.
 One of them, "learning from abstractions," seems to be difficult to understand due to a lack of examples, so I will try to explain it more clearly by adding concrete examples here.

 Learning from abstractions" was a way to read "texts intended to help the reader abstract," and thereby promote abstraction within oneself. So what exactly are "texts intended to help the reader abstract"?

 For example, statements such as "X has three elements A, B, and C" fall under this category.
		Specifically, "There are [broad view] axis, [deep understanding] axis, and [application] axis in the way of learning," etc.
		There are many different elements to the specific study, many different methods, and each individual case is different.
		By busting up and showing some of the differences, it helps the reader to abstract them in their mind.

 People who read such a text are divided into two groups by their reactions. For readers on one side, there will be a reciprocal reaction between this text and the reader's experience.
 For example:
  From my own experience, X can indeed be classified into those three categories. I had not been able to verbalize it until now. I see. I'll call it by those names from now on."
  'In all my experience, I was aware of A and B, but not of C. It was a blind spot. I see. From now on, I will be careful not to overlook C."
  In my experience, C doesn't matter much."
  From my own experience, I think it's important to remember that there's this other important thing, D."

 In both cases, changes are taking place in the direction of helping people organize their experiences, find structure, and create models through abstraction.
 	Specific examples:
 		In the book review blog written by a reader, "[https://takuan-osho.hatenablog.com/entry/2014/05/08/book-review-about-webdbpress-vol-80 WEB+DB PRESS vol. 80's feature article "The Engineer's How to Learn" in WEB+DB PRESS vol. 80, I was curious to read the review, so I bought the corresponding book and read it - Programmer's March, Chapter 2]".
 		>I was somewhat aware that I was neglecting parts 2 and 3, but by giving them clear names and positioning, such as the "[abstraction]" phase, it became easier to determine "which phase of learning I am currently doing, and which axis of knowledge I am currently lacking? It became easier for me to make decisions such as, "What phase do I learn now, and what axis of knowledge do I currently lack?
 		The description of the project is as follows.
				#Reproduction with labeling

 On the other hand, there are readers who do not come up with "their own experiences" when they read these abstract texts.
	 For example:
 	 What makes you say that?"
 		'It's kind of abstract and confusing...'
 	 I don't know, but it sounds important, so I'll make a note of it."

 The author has made abstractions from his own experience to create an abstract model, which he then writes about in his text.
 	However, if the reader does not have an experience that fits that model, the reader will not get a "feeling of fit".
 	In this situation, even if you write something down in a notebook, you will forget it immediately and will not be able to make effective use of it.
 	This is not the fault of the reader. It is due to a major mismatch between the author's and the reader's experience.
 	[https://gyazo.com/1a5b4b23cbf47c7d6bf487565aed3226]

 The author tries to get as many readers to understand as possible, so he "gets down to it" with lots of concrete examples.
 	However, it is not possible to know in advance the experience that all readers have and give examples that all will understand.
 	Mismatches cannot be eliminated.

 After all, it is "luck" whether one can read books and other materials and learn the abstract models described therein.
	 Sometimes, "I don't know what I wrote down, but I wrote it down," is fortunately connected to other knowledge and put to good use, and sometimes, unluckily, it is forgotten without being recalled.
	 Luck cannot be improved by effort.
 	That is why it is important not only to spend time "learning from abstractions" but also to try other methods such as "[learning by] making.
