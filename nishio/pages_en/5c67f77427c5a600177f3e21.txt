	When a new social networking service is just starting out, its users are a set of early adopters
		[relaxed] situation 1 - 2
	This situation is favorable for users, but not for SNS operators
		The more users, the easier it is to monetize.
			The "number of users needs to increase" is hypothetical.
			Often the number of users becomes a quantitative KPI and becomes an objective apart from whether it really matters
	Average value is diluted when user expansion policies are implemented.
		[relaxed] situation 3
		Resource-hungry people start fighting each other.
		Early adopters are leaving that social networking site.
		This makes social networking disposable.
	So why don't we concentrate on the early adopters to prevent that from happening, and not have an expansion policy?
		A model that charges from early adopters is unlikely to be viable.
			The paid SNS market is scorched because there are too many free SNSs being offered to attract users.
			Where's the salon?
				It is a closed, paid community.
				Not a group of early adopters.
				A model where people with productive capacity produce content and people who consume content pay for it.
	How about "social networking on the run" as a solution to these compositions?
		design
 		Create SNS A
 		When SNS A takes an expansion path, a new SNS B is created at the same time
 		Send B invitations to A's initial users.
 		Provide automatic multi-posting from B to A
 		Ensure that reactions on A can be seen on B if you want to see them.
 		Repeat after this as many times as necessary.
		What happens.
			As SNS A expands and value is diluted, early adopter X moves to B
			X is communicating on B
			Late majorities on SNS A misidentify X as if X were active on SNS A
