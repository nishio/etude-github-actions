So why was it frozen?

The selected element is being put into [ReactN] and then frozen when it is taken out. Kindly designed to prevent inadvertent destructive updates and a nasty bug.

When grouping the selected ones, this is what was written, which is wrong
code:ts
   const group = new GroupItem();
   group.items = g.selected_items;
This will cause the new group to have a reference to the frozen object itself, and then when you try to add to that group, you will get the above error.

code:ts
   group.items = [...g.selected_items];
This is what I should have done.
