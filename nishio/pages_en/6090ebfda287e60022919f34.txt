 Easy Japanese Cooking(by Kentaro Kobayashi)</a>
 
 No, I know it's not, but I can't help but wonder if this was Kentaro Kobayashi's contraption. I am very suspicious of "Donburi Mania" and "Bento LOVE". I am sure that the contents are full of outrageous and false dishes.

 It's kind of very hard today.
 
 *1234174604*Cursor disappears and reappears in Firefox
 I've been trying to figure out why the cursor doesn't appear in the edit box of Hatena Diary anymore, and instead a huge cursor appears in a non-textarea area.

 Pressing F7 restored it. It seems that the caret browse was turned on before I knew it.

 Hackathon now! There are already people there! I went to the company tour and was put on the kill list. The world is full of absurdity! http://tech.g.hatena.ne.jp/itkz/20090209/1234184919
 
 *1234208480*hg Notes.
 - 1: Plug the source code of the running service into the Mercurial repository
 - 2: Fix and commit heavily to create a new version.
 - 3: "Oh, I need to make some corrections to the one that's working now!"
 
 A note on the situation that.
 
 - 4: Commit&push to the point you were just tweaking for now.
 - 5: Find out the revision before you start tinkering with the source for a new version.
 - 6: "hg clone -r 1e9d3c9de1a7 https://リポジトリの位置/ local directory name". 1e9d3c9de1a7 is the revision before change
 - 7: Unfortunately, it turned out that the deployed code had been committed with some minor modifications (specifically, the application name needed to be changed, so that was the only thing that needed to be changed).
 - 8: Modify and deploy
 - 9: "hg branch new branch name". The command "create a branch with that name in the next commit".
 - 10: I realize I hg commit before hg branch, should have done branch first. hg push says "you'll have a new head! If I try to hg push, it says "You'll have a new head!
 - 11: Force
 - 12: The first commit had the status "The modification so far is an unnamed branch and the result of this change is the latest version of A" and the next commit had the status "A new branch was created from A". Mwah. I wonder what happens if I modify the mainline one here and push it.

 - 13: "note: unsynced remote changes! But the push itself seems to have succeeded. Oh, the main stream is now mainstreamed successfully.

 I guess I should have reverted to the pre-commit state without modifying the local files at 10, but I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to do that, but hg revert doesn't work.
 
 
 Ah, every time I push, I get "note: unsynced remote changes! I wonder what happens when I pull it.
