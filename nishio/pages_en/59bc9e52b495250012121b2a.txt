abstract concept
	I've looked up A and B. I'm not sure if they are interchangeable or not. I've looked them up, but I'm not sure, with some stating they are compatible and others stating they are not."
 	I think the reason there are mixed claims of compatibility and incompatibility is that people have different ideas of what they mean by "compatibility".
  So instead of "Is it compatible or not?", we should be more specific: "Can we do ~ or not? Can't we?" I think it would be better to ask the question, "Can we do it?

ã€€Same meaning as "[abstract concept]", I use this one when I pair it with "[concrete experience]".
