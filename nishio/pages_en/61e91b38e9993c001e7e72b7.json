(1.3.3.3) Rough structure of documents
I show you a true story as an example of understanding the rough structure of documents. 

One day I was talking about Python's scope system. I said the global scope in Python corresponds to each script file. Mr. X asked me as follows.

>The description of the global statement in the "[Python Language Referene]" does not say such a thing. Where is it written?

The first thought when I heard that is as follows.

> It should be written in "Python [tutorial]." 
> Also, in "Python language reference" it should not be in the grammar definition chapter. There should be a chapter of the execution model before the grammar definition chapter.

After that, I [search] some keyword on [Google] and answered as follows.

> It is written in "9.2. Scope and namespace of Python" of "Python tutorial." 
> Also, it is in the section "naming and binding" in "Python language reference."

Mr. X is not an inferior programmer than me. The difference between he and me is that I knew the rough structure of the Python documents. *23

 	What Mr. X saw was `7. Simple statements > 7.12. The global statement.`
		I show him is `4. Execution model > 4.2. Naming and binding > 4.2.2. Resolution of names.`
