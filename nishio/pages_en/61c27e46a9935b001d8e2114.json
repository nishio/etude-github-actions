I'm not going to pretend I understand.
When we "pretend to understand" a phenomenon by applying "borrowed words" to it, the development of our thinking about the phenomenon stops there.

Why is this so?
　By [pretending to understand], they themselves are deceived into thinking that the phenomenon has been explained in words.
　But that "word" is a word that is "[floating] in the air", "[rootless]", and "poorly linked to other words", so there is no development from the word's use.

Shouldn't the words be, "I don't know yet" or "I can't quite put it into words."
