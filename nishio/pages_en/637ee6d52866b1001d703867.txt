Promises delay development.
[https://bufferings.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/11/23/122815 Promises delay development - Mitsuyuki.Shiiba]
　If you are lucky, 1 month, if you are 60% confident that the task will be completed in 2 months.
　If someone outside the team asks for [an estimate], you can't answer something that you're 60% confident in.
　　Because people who have not experienced the same manufacturing process [nishio.icon] will misinterpret [variance in estimates] as small.

　　　　Mr. A. "There's a 50% chance it will be over in two months."
　　　　Mr. B: "I see, so three months is 90% certain."
　　　　Mr. A: "No, it's not, if you need 90% certain [commitment], it's six months."
　　　Related [dispersion may be different?]　[Could the shape of the distribution be different?]
　Survey costs are high when trying to provide a 90% certainty estimate.
　　[nishio.icon]This is a given.
　　　The "possible causes of delay" are all investigated in advance to estimate how long the delay will be.
　　　　Contrary to [the YAGNI Principles].
　　　[Risk aversion] is "paying in advance for something you may not need."
　　　　Same as [insurance
　[nishio.icon]The root cause is where A and B have different variance of estimates.
　　This in itself is not a bad thing, there are cases where a small estimate of variance is necessary.
　　If B is unaware of the size of the variance, he will seek a smaller variance even where the variance is larger and better, and will waste money on insurance.

However, such a story is based on the premise that [* the mindset of the person receiving the estimate must change] (and that is often difficult to do...).

>The problem is that the estimate ends up being a promise and they are not willing to adjust the schedule afterwards.

I think I heard something like that in [Deadline (book)] or something like that.

I'm taking the job like please give me money for the investigation period first.
	>[https://twitter.com/voluntas/status/1595961871580147713?s=20&t=f1YxxnHj5Nt0M3GHDzHeWg @voluntas]: we will investigate if it is feasible in the time frame specified in the survey period, so we both have peace of mind. You will only have to deal with companies that can pay for the survey. It's a good thing.
