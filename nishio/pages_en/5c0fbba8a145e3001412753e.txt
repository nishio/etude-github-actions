	>I found out that my mind is cluttered, so I've been quietly sorting through [GTD], but I seem to get [cluttered] when I have a number of [tasks] in [waiting state] in [parallel]. What I should do is "[wait]", so I don't have to worry about it. Oh, rather, I feel like [TODO] because I think it's [wait], and it's a mess? Should it be "[check] tomorrow night?"
 > Shohei Hito Waiting has a [state], so it's nice to set a [reminder] to [make it an event] and make it easier to forget.
 > Shigeya Suzuki The tool I use (OmniFocus) allows me to specify a [date to be active] in addition to the deadline, and to [suspend] until that date. You can also [group tasks hierarchically] and specify entire groups, which is very convenient. It may sound very complicated, but it has all the features you need!
