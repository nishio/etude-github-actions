 *1194999842* I woke up.
 I noticed that the PDF of the ICPC problem was left open, so I flipped through it. I thought the problem of finding the furthest point from the sea looked difficult, but it is a convex problem. So, the inscribed circle is surely only tangent at a point other than the vertex. I'll solve it when I feel like it.
 
 ---
 
 PS: Since it is convex, we can say that the distance to the sea has only one extreme value, so I used linear programming to do it quickly. (but I don't know much about linear programming)

 Mis-conversion of "enough to change".
 
 Tiny?

 There is some concern that if anyone really becomes a committer and the number of people grows, it will collapse someday, but as Wikipedia is doing so well, I guess I don't have to worry so much. It's revision controlled, and you can't commit anonymously.
 
 If we disagree on editorial policy, we can just branch out.
 
 Two people split into brunches and have a merge battle in the trunk.
 
 *1195026843*PLY and PyBison
 I was studying PLY, but I think what I needed was PyBison, not PLY!
 In the meantime, install Bison and Flex on VMWare because it says it won't work on Windows!
 
 *1195027792*PyBison
 Is this also using Pyrex?
 
 *1195028272*Pyrex
 Installation is easy, just download, extract, and install python setup.py. However, there are two obvious (and easily fixable) mistakes in setup.py, and if I don't fix them, I can't install the software. Is this a challenge from the author, "If you can't fix this, you can't use it"? (No way).
 
 By the way, I'm missing one closing bracket and two that I didn't IMPORT. I guess that means it's too easy and people will fix it themselves.
 
 *1195028514*PyBison

 Presently, PyBison is only working on Linux (and possibly *BSD-based) systems.

 You wrote that.

 The yacc code that was in the PHP source distribution is giving me an error with bison in the first place, what should I do...

 PHP_Parser is a source code analysis tool based around a real Parser
 generated by PHP_ParserGenerator. The parser uses the same EBNF source that PHP
 uses to parse itself, modified for Lemon parser format, and it therefore as robust
 as PHP itself.

 *1195040623* Ahh.
 Uh-oh.
 
 Let's go home.
 
 Oh, let's change the style sheet on this blog for good.
 Doing something that is a pain in the ass is brain training.
 
 *1195043129* redesign
 I changed the design, which I had been neglecting for some time because I had been thinking of doing it for some time, to a well acceptable level.
 There is no end to the details, so let's leave it at that for now.
 
 *1195043475*Stylesheet
 I, How to Write Org's style sheet is generated in Python so that the same color specification is not spread all over the place, but as I was changing it now, I was thinking that it would be better to be able to change multiple colors at once. I was thinking that it would be better to be able to change multiple colors at once, such as changing all bluish colors to greenish. Or, you could select a few elements in the browser and shift the hue of all of them at once. Or you could use the scrollbar to change the hue of the elements in the browser. Technically, it's not that difficult, so I'm sure it's out there somewhere.
 
 Well, I don't really look for style sheets, since this is the only time I do.

 Oh, gosh, gosh!
 
 Jun Hirai, famous for hirax.net, when did he start this project...
 
 He said that the result of the engineer solving this problem is not much different from the answer to the question by rolling the dice.
