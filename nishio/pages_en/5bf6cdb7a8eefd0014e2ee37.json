Sexuality and sexuality are false dichotomies.
The [false dichotomy] of [sexual] good and [sexual] evil.

From [Konosuke Matsushita]'s [Thinking about Human Beings] p.157
	What to do about evil that cannot be extinguished
 Identify the power of evil and the workings of evil and utilize them in communal life, [using them] for good.
 Accept the existence of evil as it is and consider ways to deal with evil in its own way.

Not "all humans are good, so we don't need to take measures to prevent abuse."
It's not a "we are all evil, so we need to take precautions so that we can't be abused."
We believe that there is both [good] and [evil] in people, but that the distinction is only tentative.
The idea of "using evil for good" rather than fixed good and evil.

[bad people do good]
