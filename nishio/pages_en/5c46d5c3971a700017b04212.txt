Tips on creating [essence of meaning], [concept handles].
This is true for creating one-line headings in the [KJ method], but I believe the same is true for page titles in Scrapbox.

>There is something very important when creating the "essence" of meaning. It is very important not to be overly [abstract]. Rather, it is better to write down the essence of the speaker's main point in the softest possible language. For example, let's say there is a favorable comment about drinking alcohol. To compress it into a one-line headline, it would be better to write, "You should drink alcohol," rather than "[an approving statement of the effects of drinking].
>In this regard, experience has shown that there is an interesting problem. Japanese men often make a mistake in this regard. They tend to create one-line headlines that, without any need to do so, over-abstract the essence of what is being said to a strangely high degree, using difficult terms of art and rigid idioms. This is not good. It is better to express yourself as softly as possible, so that the "texture of the original statement" is conveyed as much as possible. One-line headings that convey the "earthy scent" of the original statement as much as possible are best.
