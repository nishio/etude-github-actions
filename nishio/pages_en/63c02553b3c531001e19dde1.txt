 　You need to study up.

 　[General of Monkey Mountain] described it as "not looking outside the mountain."
  [Fog of Literacy] thought, "Maybe you can't see it in the first place."

　Any argument that A makes against B for "having less knowledge" in this situation [boomerangs].
　　However, because of A's narrow field of view, A cannot observe it
　　B may be observable
　　　but in many cases, B is not willing to "teach" A because B perceives A as an "obnoxious person".
　["Do it right" is also related to the mid-core philosophy].

　　If they ask, I'll tell them, otherwise I'll be non-interventionist, which is good.
