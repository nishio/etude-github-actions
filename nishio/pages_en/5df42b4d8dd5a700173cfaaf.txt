If it takes too long to load, there is a risk of loss.

	In designing the app, I designed it as "the app has one map".
	We decided to create a map of the initial state when the app is launched.
	Subsequently, the following features were added
		At startup, it reads information from the server and loads the data, if any.
		Whenever there is a Map update, save it to the server.
	Usually the loading time is instantaneous, so it wasn't a problem.
	But after 6 hours of accumulating many people's drawings, it started to take a long time.
	Editing the initial state map before loading is complete writes its contents to the server

solution
	The "app has one map" is incorrect.
	App has a maximum of one map" is appropriate.
	The initial state of the application is "Do you want to create a new map? Open existing map?" It should be
		The initial map is created only when you choose to create a new one.
	Those who opened the edit link directly chose "Open Existing Map" equivalent.
		In this case, the loading indicator should be displayed until the loading is completed and editing should not be allowed.
