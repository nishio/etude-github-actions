A naive implementation of [$ O(N^2\log N)] is to create a [suffix array] of [$ O(N)

	What is a suffix array?
	code:python
	 data = "abracadabra$"
  
  buf = []
  for i in range(len(data)):
      buf.append((data[i:], i))
  
  buf.sort()
  
  for x in buf:
      print(x)
	Suffix arrays can be made to efficiently discover the location of the occurrence of a particular keyword in a dichotomous search.
	Use bucket sorting on the first character

difficult (e.g. customer, guest, child)
