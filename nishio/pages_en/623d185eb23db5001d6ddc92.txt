Link Suggestions
When I use the term [link suggestion], I don't know which of the following two it is
　Scrapbox itself has a feature that does an [ambiguous search] while you are typing in a link and suggests links that may be relevant.
　　see [Scrapbox suggestions are useful].
　If you do not have Scrapbox itself, and you enter multiple pages that do not yet have links to make use of Scrapbox, the function will suggest "links that would be good to create".
　　Here is what I originally called [link suggestions
　　　[How Link Suggestions/Transversal Ambiguous Searches Work]

I thought it would be clearer to recognize the latter as a proposed system for [scaffolding networks].
