New maps can be created offline.
from [pRegroup2020]
I think we should be able to create new maps offline.
ã€€Is this quite difficult?

	In the first place, it is still possible to create a blank new one at this point.
		It is "saved as new map" after the fact and stored in the cloud.
	The state before saving is not saved locally, so reloading will make it disappear.

	Add the top page to [Add to Home screen].
		Recent Maps on the top page
			Put in [IndexedDB
		You can see there whether the server storage is available or not.

I thought it had to work offline... but when I actually try to use it outside, it asks me if I want to connect to a nearby phone tethering.
