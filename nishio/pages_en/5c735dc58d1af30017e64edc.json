Don't persuade people you don't need to persuade.
	You don't have to convince anyone you don't need to convince.
		[I wrote this because I thought it was important to write about the obvious, even though it sounds like [tautology].
 		I changed it to "don't try to convince people you don't need to convince."
   A little less tautological.
	It's so obvious, yet so often forgotten.
	When others have an opinion that differs from one's own, one often feels as if one has to convince them of it.
	Others are often "[people] who do not need to be persuaded.

	If others have [different opinions] from you, it is often "unimportant.
	If someone has an opinion that differs from yours, it does not mean that you have been denied the right to hold that opinion.
	There is no need to feel as if your existence is threatened and to be defensive.
		Related: [no opposition exists].

	Don't spend money on trying to convince people who don't matter.
		The cost should be spent on persuading a very small percentage of "those who need to be persuaded".
		What determines if someone needs to be persuaded or not?
		It's whether or not their opinion will affect the probability of achieving [the goal] that I want to achieve and the time frame in which I want to achieve it.
