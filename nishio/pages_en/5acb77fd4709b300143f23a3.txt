 Figure shows [$ u(x, y) = x^{0.5} y^{0.5}] when a=0.5
 This is just a weighted average if we take the logarithm of x and y, respectively
 	That is, the [utility] of one good is proportional to the logarithm of its quantity.
  	[Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility]
 On the other hand, [the budget constraint line] is a straight line on this space that does not take logarithms

Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) utility function
	[$ u(x, y) = (a x ^ r + b y ^ r) ^ {1/r}]

quadratic
	[$ u(x, y) = 2 a x - (b - y)^2]
