	I don't want to go into detail on the digital nameplate page, so I've split it up.

	>Login password : It is found in default_passwd.txt in the NAFUDA drive.
	 I'm getting an error message saying default_passwd.txt missing.
	Viewing the three connection methods, select Serial
	 `touch /Volumes/NAFUDA/enable_g_serial`
		After rebooting, /dev/cu.usbmodem1421 does not appear
	After touch, after visualizing the existence of enable_g_serial in Finder, remove it, power off, reconnect the power supply, and see the following screen

	Hmm, change to serial mode does not seem to be working properly
 I guess we'll just have to connect UART.
	I tried to generate default_passwd.txt and rebooted it, just to see if it would work.
 	The existence of the password was recognized.
 Once again `touch /Volumes/NAFUDA/enable_g_serial`.
 	Still in g_mass_strage mode
 To be continued at UART.

 	>After rebooting, are the enable_g_serial files correctly erased from the NAFUDA drive?
  > If the file disappears correctly but is not reflected, try waiting 20 seconds after touch on the Mac before starting the eject operation! We are aware of the phenomenon!
	Try this first next time

What we want to do
	Wait 20 seconds and try eject first
	[- Login via SSH].
	 Log in with UART
 Install Jenkins
 I want the source code in RasPi to be updated when I push to Github (without having to connect cables and write and stuff).
