ONI MOD
	Falling Sand
	ã€€Collapsed sand is also subject to excavation.
	Build Over Plants
	ã€€Can direct construction where plants are growing, plants are pulled out.
	Bigger Capacity
	ã€€Capacity adjustment of hangars, etc.
	ã€€Materials to build the hangar will soon be plentiful.
	ã€€I'd rather solve this problem with a mod than with a bunch of side-by-side solutions.
	Aquatic Farm
	ã€€Farm tile that absorbs ambient water
	ã€€Not much use for it now.
	ã€€Cultivated in temperature-controlled ponds
	GasOverlay
	ã€€easy to see
	Blueprints
	ã€€Construction instructions can be copied and pasted when you want to build another one of what you have constructed.
	ã€€Can be named, saved and reused.
	DGSM - Duplicants Generation Settings Manager // by @Ony ðŸ‘¾
	ã€€Can interfere with initial duplicant and print pod behavior
	Favorite Resources // by @Ony ðŸ‘¾
	ã€€Improved resource display
	Self-sealing Airlocks
	ã€€It's also airtight when the airlock is open.
	ã€€Airtight release when open
	ã€€Liquid airlock is troublesome.
	Bigger Camera Zoom Out
	ã€€Zoom in all the way
	Longer Bridges
	ã€€Long bridge across two pipes
	Buildable AETN
	ã€€Anti-entropy device can be built.
	Travel tube crossing wall and ladder
	ã€€Tubes can intersect with ladders
	No Drop // by @Ony ðŸ‘¾
	ã€€Don't drop things.
	ChainedDeconstruction
	ã€€Dismantle contiguous items together.
	Bigger Building Menu
	ã€€Make menus larger to reduce scrolling
	Speed Control
	ã€€I always play it 10x faster.
	Half Door
	ã€€1 square door
	Deconstructable POI Props
	ã€€Demolish ruins and stuff.
	ã€€demon who obstructs sentient beings from maintaining moral behaviour
	Fluid Shipping
	ã€€Equipment that allows liquid tanks to be carried and then placed directly into pipes
	Smart Mop // by @Ony ðŸ‘¾
	ã€€Cumbersome to select a range of mopping.
	ã€€Mop up a continuous stream of liquids with a single click
	Advanced Electrolyzer
	ã€€Hydrogen and oxygen enter the pipe separately.
	ã€€A mechanism for separation without filters can now be made in Sola, and it's a pain to make.
	ã€€ã€€[/OxygenNotIncluded/SPOM]
	ã€€PH2O can be converted to PO2, which can also replace the evaporator.
	Buildable Natural Tile
	ã€€Can install soil blocks, etc.
	ã€€Baking argae is a hassle.
	ã€€The same amount of resources are required, so the resources cannot be increased.
	Butcher & Fishing Stations
	ã€€Equipment to turn surplus organisms into meat
	Double Sweeper Range
	ã€€Extend the scope and increase the room for automation
	Compact Info Cards
	ã€€Display Improvement
	Efficient Supply
	ã€€I wonder what it's called.
	Crack Reacher
	ã€€Extend the scope of construction, etc.
	Cooling Element
	ã€€Not tried yet, a device that uses electricity to cool (thermal destruction)
	ã€€We can now do active cooling with boilers, and we've built a number of them, and it's getting tedious.
	Pliers
	ã€€I can chop the pipe.
	ã€€Pipes can be disconnected immediately instead of waiting for a dismantling instruction.
	Black Hole Garbage Disposal
	ã€€Throw away things you don't need (and don't use yet)
	ã€€If they start doing natural gas distillation or something and make sulfur or something that has zero use, I'd be tempted to dump it.
	ã€€If I dump the regolith, will the machine run lighter?
	ã€€The solution for infinite liquid tanks is airlock doors and airflow tiles, while infinite gas tanks are saunas.
	ã€€Infinite gas tanks have a well-known solution of liquid to vent, but it's a hassle, so I only use saunas these days.
	Piped output
	ã€€Recently added
	ã€€Convert all environmental emission type facilities to pipe output type
	ã€€ã€€It is upwardly compatible with Advanced Electrolyzer.
	ã€€Sealing the equipment and pumping it will solve the problem, when that hassle is too much.
	Thermal Isolation Door
	ã€€Doors to be insulated
	ã€€If you stack three doors on top of each other and only raise the middle one, you can insulate it by creating a vacuum, but when that's too much trouble.
	Advanced Generators 2
		A generator that generates electricity by absorbing ambient heat.
		Operating temperatures range from 10 to 55 degrees Celsius, so it is not a replacement for boilers
		Good for compactly cooling a living area.
		If you have a type of farm where 10 degrees Celsius is the optimum temperature, it is easy to maintain the optimum temperature just by placing this on the farm.
	Simpler Pip Plant Rule
	ã€€Simplify Pip's seeding rules.
	ã€€Leave it alone and plant it just fine.
	ã€€It's a pain in the ass to control if you try hard enough with a ladder or something.
	Power Tweaks
	ã€€Power-related balancing
	ã€€I don't think I need this one anymore.
	Claustrophobia - Stuck Duplicant Alert
	ã€€Alerts you when you're trapped.
	ã€€Avoiding Unexpected Death

What I want now
I want a device that has all the SCPS PowerGrid distribution equipment in one piece, it's a pain to make every time.

In retrospect, the "trial-and-error stage of figuring out how to do something" is fun, but once it stabilizes, I find myself saying, "I hate doing work that I know how to do.
