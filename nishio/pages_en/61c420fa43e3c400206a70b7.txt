>Unique optical system that can be mounted only by overcoming weight and size constraints, and also supports variable focus function to realize overwhelming viewing angles and image beauty.

>There is a limit to the optics that can be mounted in a limited space and weight.
> HalfDive overcame these limitations by incorporating a total of 10 aspherical lenses to solve the problems of existing optical systems using Fresnel lenses, such as distortion, flare, and image degradation, while achieving an optical system that enables both an ultra-high viewing angle of up to approximately 134 degrees and clear images.

VR goggles have become inexpensive, but there is a tradeoff between performance and weight due to the convenience of wearing them on the head.
By keeping the side of the goggles stationary, performance can be pursued without worrying about weight.
Personally, I think that in the future when VR will be used for business purposes, it is more likely that it will not be a system where the full weight is placed on the human head, but rather a system where the head is attached to the headrest of a chair and lowered from above like a perm machine at a hair salon.
