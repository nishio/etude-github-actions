To stay on the shoulders of giants, we must keep running.
There's a saying, "[Riding on the shoulders of the Titans]," but those Titans die and change generations, or the Titans kill each other, so you have to work for it to keep riding on their shoulders. You have to [keep running] to stay, something like that.

Riding on the shoulders of giants does not lead to competitive advantage over those who can also ride on the shoulders of giants, so we tend to focus on differentiating what we do on their shoulders. However, over time, the giant you are riding on will wane, and if you don't change your ways, you will be destroyed by new entrants riding new giants.

Those on the shoulders of old giants ignore the giant part, so they consider new entrants to be no big deal. But the difference in competitiveness is brought about by the giants on board. No matter how tall you stand on your shoulders, it doesn't matter.

So you have to keep running, and you have to create a situation where you can keep running before the first giant dies.
