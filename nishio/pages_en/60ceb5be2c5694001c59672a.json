Card listings work well on pages without content.
[Scrapbox usage considerations].
 I saw a statement somewhere that "I don't care to add links because I don't look at the [card list] at the bottom of the Scrapbox page.
 This is a discrepancy with my understanding of how to use Scrapbox, but I thought it would be interesting to dig deeper to find out where the discrepancy comes from.
 Dig into your perceptions.
 　I'm not linking to make a card list.
 　So you seem to think the "I don't feel the card list is worth it, so I won't link to it" argument is odd.
 　So you don't feel you are worth the card list?
 　　I feel it.
 　Do you always look at the card list?
 　　Not always.
 　　On pages with a lot of content, often with a lot of links, the card list is huge, not much to look at
 　At what point do you look at the card list?
 　　[Empty page]
 　　　No wonder, since the only content is the card list.
 　　Pages for redirection and absorption of notational errors
 　　　The text only says "see X" or "notation shaking Y".
 　　Short pages of content
 　　　Something that is less than one page.
 　In other words, if you only use long-form content created outside of Scrapbox and paste it into Scrapbox to create "long-form pages with few links," you may not observe situations where you would be happy to have a card list in the first place.
 　　That's why some people don't see the need for it.
