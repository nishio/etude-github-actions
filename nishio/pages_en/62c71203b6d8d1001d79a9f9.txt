Youth, sample size, and variance in judgment
Younger people tend to have less experience.
Less experience means a smaller sample size and therefore a larger variance of the mean of that sample.
So the percentage of radical decisions increases.

concrete example
　Observe out of a bag that contains half black stones and half white stones.
　At the time of taking out three pieces.
　　All three were white! Everything inside must be white!" 1/8
　　All three were black! Everything inside must be black!" 1/8
　Each drops to less than 0.1% when 10 are taken out.
