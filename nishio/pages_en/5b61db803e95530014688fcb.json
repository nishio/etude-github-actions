study and fall prey to confirmation bias.
I think that the "read a lot of books and [study] a lot" style inadvertently leads to behavior stuck in the "confirmation bias," in which one's initial randomly acquired beliefs are later corroborated by the texts in the books one reads.

In the case of learning programming, if you acquire a false belief by reading a book, you can get out of that [false belief] by writing a program according to that belief and observing that it does not work as expected.

For those areas of low [verifiability], we need to focus on statements that contradict beliefs, keeping in mind that it is easy to fall prey to confirmation bias.
