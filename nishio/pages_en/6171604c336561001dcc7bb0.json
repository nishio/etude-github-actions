Put the most informative image on top.
[Scrapbox Best Practices]

Looking back at some of the articles I wrote in the past, I've drawn some diagrams to illustrate things.
　At this point, there is a simple diagram that comes first to talk about the premise, followed by a diagram that adds to it
	　At this time, Scrapbox will use the simpler diagram at the top as a thumbnail
　When there is a simple figure A and an informative figure B
　　If you can naturally explain B, A in that order, that's fine.
　　If you want to explain A, B in that order and then say, "Oh, B has more information," just copy and paste B at the top.
  　E.g.: [train subordinates].
  　 Written in 2017, last figure copied and pasted at the top of the page in 2021.
　The reason they started doing it this way would be the Kozaneba Development Diary.
　 Developing a day's worth of development, with screenshots from top to bottom.
　 This would naturally make the oldest image the thumbnail.
　 The "there's a bug like this" and "it's fixed" stream of buggy images as thumbnails.
　 So I started putting the best image at the top of the page as "Today's Picture of the Day".
　 [2021-07-01].
　 　This is the oldest one that says "One of the Day" on it.

　　　Eventually I stopped writing "one of the day."
