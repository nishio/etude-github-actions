 *1229425310*KNOPPIX for CUDA cannot start with "Can't find KNOPPIX filesystem" problem (resolved).
 Last time I wrote about loading an ML115 with an 8800GT, but it seems that the information was quite old and neither of them are sold anymore. So I bought a <a href="http://www.faith-go.co.jp/pc/model/?id=70049">Seed E85000XN/DVR</a>. As soon as it arrived, I burned <a href="http://www.yasuoka.mech.keio.ac.jp/cuda/">KNOPPIX for CUDA</a> to a CD and tried booting it. However, I get the error message "Can'nt find KNOPPIX filesystem".
 
 
 I did a quick search and found a few sites that said something like "Knoppix does not support booting from USB CD drivers at this time," but they didn't specify the version of Knoppix or even the date of writing the article, so I read it with a furrowed brow. I read the article with a raised eyebrow, because it didn't specify the version of Knoppix or even the date when the article was written. I'm not sure.
 
 
 I searched for E85000XN/DVR specs and found "optical drive: SATA Super Multi", so I searched for SATA, and sure enough, there were a few stories about SATA not working. I tried to use a USB drive, but it didn't work with SATA. It worked. I was happy and satisfied. The dock? I clicked on the galaxy icon on the dock, pressed 3 to enter GPU mode, and then pressed Enter to start, and the silver family budget collision ran at a comfortable speed. Cool.
 
 
 
 I thought it might be a bit inconvenient as it is, so I looked into it. According to <a href='http://blog.yasaka.com/archives/2005/02/knoppixwinxp.html'>Î¼ memo: Recover WinXP files with knoppix</a>, if you set SATA mode to combo in BIOS I can see them from Knoppix if I set SATA mode to combo in BIOS. However, I've looked around the BIOS settings screen and can't figure out what to do.
