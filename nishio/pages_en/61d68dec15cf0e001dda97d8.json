Face-to-face conversation and work sharing
Talking face to face on [Zoom] is a mental model of face-to-face conversation.
　[metaphor for face-to-face dialogue].

[LINKLET] is a [collaborative] mental model
　Because we don't look at each other's faces, but rather at the object of our work, we talk to each other.

[MobPro] and other "screen sharing and talking while looking at it" is similarly a conversation while looking at the object of work.

Instead of "working alone on a digital object and then showing it to others after it has taken shape," it is more efficient for the team as a whole to "share the screen, show the work process, and get quick feedback.
This is the flow of change in Cybozu, from PairPro to MobPro to mob work such as documents and lecture materials, and in this context, LINKLET is a tool to support "mob physical work".

The reason why mobpro is beneficial is because it is [a means of sharing information without verbalizing it].
The implicit dissatisfaction that I feel with "groupware that can't be used unless it's verbalized" is expressed in the form of choosing to do it with MobPro.
