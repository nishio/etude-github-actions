fall for (something)
[https://note.com/shinshinohara/n/ndd13af2c65e0 "Immersive" experiences hone observational skills｜shinshinohara｜note]
 Children can be [obsessed] with one thing.
 Parents may stop such behavior because they think it is "[misbehaving].
 But that would stop "[learning]".
	The experiences that one pursues and thoroughly observes to the point of "immersion" become the "axis of coordinates" for organizing one's subsequent experiences.

When I was a toddler, I used to ask my grandfather "What is this? and my grandfather would answer one by one.
　I think you have great patience.
　I think it must have been an educational style that did not interfere with my obsession, not just this one.
　They want to go to the mall and read books in the bookstore so they can read silently and let them read as much as they want.
