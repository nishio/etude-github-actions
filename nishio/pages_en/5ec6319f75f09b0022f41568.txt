replace the foundation

After creating a certain program, I wanted to change the foundation of that program (how to have data, data structure, etc.).
I had a lot of trouble deciding whether to do it with a new project or change it from the current code.
	[The "should we rebuild or not?" is a false choice.]
ã€€I was not sure what to do with it.

This time, after much discussion, the word "[interface]" came up and the project moved forward.
First identify the interface where the data will be stored and attach a branch to that interface
Temporarily, data will be in the form of double holdings.
Then identify the interface that uses that data and replace it

This way, unlike rebuilding from scratch, part B serves as a sort of test.
And since I was writing in TypeScript this time, the type checking helped a lot,
It's also a test to see if the behavior changes after the switch.

In the process of doing it, I discovered a lot of oversights in the implementation of 'a', so I'm glad I was able to scaffold 'b'.
If they had to rebuild from scratch, they wouldn't have realized the design error until they implemented the B equivalent.
