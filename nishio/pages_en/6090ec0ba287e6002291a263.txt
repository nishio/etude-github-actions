 EDSAC is a computer circa 1949. <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDSAC'>EDSAC - Wikipedia</a>.
 The machine language is very simple with 18 instruction types. I believe that the current x86 instruction set is so huge that it is no longer possible to keep track of all of them, which is not good for education. So I made a simple computer, EDSAC.

 The image shows a program written by Professor Eiichi Wada to find prime numbers in the sieve of Eratosthenes running. With his permission, I have included it in the preset, and click the "Load Wada Seive" button on the Source tab! (UI has room for improvement...)
 
 The black and green pattern on the far right shows all of EDSAC's memory in one bit per pixel. Click on it to see the details of the memory in that range in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. The display is in the process of sifting through just 3.
 
 A brief summary of how much memory EDSAC has and what the instruction set is like can be found here: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/edsacposter.pdf
 
 Initial Order" is a program that reads "human-readable instructions" from punched tape, converts them into "machine-readable bit strings," and stores them in memory. It is a very primitive programming language, so to speak.
 
 It is interesting, for example, the fact that only 5 bits are used to represent a single character. So only 32 types of characters can be represented, which means that 26 alphabetic characters and 10 numeric characters cannot be represented. So we have two modes, one for displaying numbers and the other for displaying alphabets, and we switch between the two modes using shift characters.
 
 The JavaScript source code is about 1700 lines in total and is available under the GPL. https://github.com/nishio/EDSAC-on-browser

 I haven't spent any time at all on writing a commentary in Japanese, but is anyone interested?
