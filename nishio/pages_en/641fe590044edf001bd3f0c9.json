Cryptocurrency as payment for work done for AI
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639873516312088578] When human work is needed for AI (e.g. scanning paper books), there is a choice whether to pay for it in A: dollars, B: "points" that can be used for AI use, or C: cryptocurrency. I wonder why some people emotionally reject the idea that there is a choice between A: dollars, B: "points that can be used for AI", and C: cryptocurrency, and of course there is a possibility that it will be C.

It is easier to be established as a currency. And in the early stages, AI-related services will be in the form of "you can pay in dollars or in cryptocurrency", so it's a staple.
