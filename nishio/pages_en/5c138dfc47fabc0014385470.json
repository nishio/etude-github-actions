Training to watch
We tend to think of [meditation] as a metaphor for becoming mindless or eliminating distractions or "stopping.
Stopping is action.
Training to observe.
First separate yourself as an observer from yourself as an object of observation.
主客分離。
Next, it returns to one piece while maintaining the separated state.
主客一体。

Observe yourself emitting emotions rather than letting your emotions take over.
Train yourself to identify whether you are in a state of emotional emission or not.
This training makes it easier to notice the occurrence of emotions in others.
Emotions have causes.
因果。
