The merits and demerits of the visual alphabet
When I read [http://amzn.to/2sIYWal Draw on the right side of your brain], I thought that the habit of relying on the [visual alphabet] acquired in childhood influenced my poor [drawing], and to escape from this habit, I learned to copy upside down, concentrate on each contour, and focus on the ground To escape from this habit, lessons are given in turning the picture upside down, concentrating on each contour line, and focusing on the space of the ground.

But when I think about it, I don't want to draw "good pictures," I just want to illustrate what I have in my brain, so if anything, I should practice the visual alphabet properly.

Wife: "You don't need to practice the visual alphabet. Anyone can do it, even write a stick figure."
I "can go as far as writing [a stick figure] and saying it's a person, but it's hard to describe the movement."
Wife: "That's not a visual alphabet, that's another skill."
