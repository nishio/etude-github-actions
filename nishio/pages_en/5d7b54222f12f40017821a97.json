eyelid myokymia
>Incidentally, "occasional twitching of one eyelid" is a condition called eyelid myokymia, not eyelid spasm. Eyelid myokymia is an involuntary twitching of the orbicularis oculi muscle, usually unilateral, and is said to be caused by physical or emotional stress. There is no effective treatment for this condition, and it often improves with relief of the above stress (slow rest).

I think it's a mistake to call it [blepharospasm] when one eye twitches.
