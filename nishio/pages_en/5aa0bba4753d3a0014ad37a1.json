False dichotomy of beneficial/non-beneficial
[https://gyazo.com/181aaa0247162ce53018c3a4487962ff]
	Tend to fall into a [false dichotomy] when talking about [beneficial] and [unbeneficial] things

	When there are more people avoiding things that may or may not be beneficial at a more than reasonable level, people will be concentrated at a more than reasonable level where it is clearly beneficial, and a [red ocean] will be created.
