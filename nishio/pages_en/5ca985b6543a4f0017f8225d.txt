Name the task as completed
This discussion is interesting.
>The name of the task should not be a summary of the activity to be done, but a summary of the state in which the task is completed.
> When progress is critical and you need someone to help you, it's hard to help if it's the former.
	>For my part, rather than naming the task completion "improve site conversion by 10%," I would prefer to manage it with an investigation task that investigates the cause, and if it turns out to be due to slow processing of the purchase screen, an implementation task that describes the specific action to be taken, such as "add indexes" or something similar.
	 > I like to manage things that I can't control the results of implementation with stories or backlog items, not tasks. I think it would be a good idea to include in the story a task that says, "You can choose from 3 or more conversion measures" or "Conversion measure A has been implemented in the production environment".

	There is a difference in the concept of what is referred to by the name "[task]."
	So disagreement arises over the advice that "the name of the task should be a summary of the state in which the task is completed."
