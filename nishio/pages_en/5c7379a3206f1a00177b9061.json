When you can learn without effort, you are not actually learning.
>When you are learning a "new language" that you can use without difficulty, it consists largely of what you have already learned, and you are learning few new concepts. You think you have learned a lot efficiently, when in fact you have not learned much that is new. This is a bad state of mind to be stuck in and you need to realize it and get out of it.
[The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production] p.28 [(1.3.4.5) When You Need Scripture Again].

In this explanation, I write "new language" because I am using the example of learning a new programming language as an example, but in general, it seems to be better to say "new concept".
Concepts that can be learned without the hardships of confusion, shock, disorientation, and conflict with one's past ideas are not significantly different from concepts already acquired. It is not a good state of affairs to misperceive that one is learning well by rapidly acquiring concepts that are not significantly different from the ones one has already acquired.

>"When you feel like you're not having a hard time learning something new, it's because it's not actually new," something like that in "The Intellectual Production of Engineers," which is often quoted in the startup community, "[When] everything seems under control, you're just not getting out as fast as you should. ]", which is similar to "When you feel like you have everything under control, you're just not going as fast as you should be".
