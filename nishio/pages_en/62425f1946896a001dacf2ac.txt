>Maine de Biran (François Pierre Gontier Maine de Biran; November 29, 1766 - July 20, 1824) was a French philosopher and politician. He is commonly known as "Maine de Biran".
> 
> Maître de Bilan's active period coincided perfectly with the French Revolution of 1789, the advent and fall of Napoleon, and the restoration of the monarchy, and he lived through those years as a politician (Maître de Bilan was three years younger than Napoleon, died three years after Napoleon's death, and was a contemporary of Napoleon). During his lifetime, Bilan was renowned as a prominent politician, and philosophy was just another facet of his life. He wrote in his later years, "We need a philosopher who will descend into the ordinary world in which we live. The speculations that emerged from this attitude toward philosophy influenced some later philosophers, and Bilan is highly regarded as the source of the philosophy of French spiritualism and French philosophy of reflection that has continued to the present day.
