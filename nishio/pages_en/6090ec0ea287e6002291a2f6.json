 *1407215862* Cybozu Style begins a series of articles on "How to Learn to be a Continuing Engineer".
 In our owned media "<a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/'>Cybozu Style | Collaboration and IT information site for "teams that create new value"</a>", "<a href='http://gihyo.jp/ We will serialize the sequel of "<a href='/feature/01/engineer-studying'>How engineers learn</a>" once a week on our owned media "<a href=''>Cybozu Style</a>".
 
 As for why we do it, I wrote about it in <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000302.html'>the first episode</a> that we published today. So here it is in a nutshell. "If you think alone, you won't notice blind spots, so let's do interviews."
 
 That is why, starting from the next issue on August 12, we will consider how engineers learn through an interview with Mr. Toshihiro Kozaki, famous for his work on the Linux kernel.
