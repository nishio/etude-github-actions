 *1430235441*Made a tool to export all Facebook activity logs to a file.
 node-webkit便利。 https://github.com/nishio/dumpfb/blob/master/main.js
 
 For now, I've decided to export the innerHTML of the activity log as is. Since my purpose is to search from my past comments, I could have discarded the "like" information, but since I am more familiar with Python than JS, I thought it would be better to write the filter in Python.
 
 In the seven years from 2008 to now, there have been 17952 activities, resulting in a 38 MB file. Image data is not included.
 
 If you open the activity log page and press the dump menu, you can click the more link every second and write the displayed activity log to a file while deleting it. A common implementation is to only click the more link first and then display the entire log, but I was concerned that this would consume too much memory and cause problems, so I designed it this way.
 
 I had a crawl stoppage in January 2011 when I started updating frequently, but when I clicked on the 2010 link, it resumed, so I haven't looked into the cause...is it because I didn't update myself much before 2011, so there are months with no updates, or is it because it is a year that is a multiple of 10? I have not been able to find out the cause of the problem.
 
 In the future, I think we may need to have a feature that stops when it finds an activity that has already been exported, but that will be made when it becomes necessary.
