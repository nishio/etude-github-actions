Silver Bullet Generation Process

[https://gyazo.com/9c344efa14ae748f6d31f0713f168681]
When you see a press release that says, "Problem A was solved using method X," etc.

General public reaction
	Then you should be able to solve problem B, and maybe you can solve our company's problem C.

Expert Response
	Based on method X, it is likely that A was achieved just in time by combining know-how Y, which is not publicly available.
	You want to solve problem C, it's not suited for you, because it's a totally different direction than X, okay?

What people who want to sell Method X tell the public
	You want to solve problem C? I see!
	Incidentally, we have a track record of solving A with method X.
	It would be worth a try on problem C! (I'm not saying you can)
	You are indeed very astute to apply this technique X to problem C! (and flattery and bullishness).

What a bullish public says to a bearish expert
	Don't look for reasons why you can't do it, get on with it!
	If you can't do it this way, give me an alternative!
