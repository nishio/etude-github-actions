Requirements for Safe Political Talk
　[Politics] in [list things you don't write about in the well].
 　A requirement of considerable importance for useful political discussions.
 　　A: Who said what is not disclosed ([Chatham House Rule])
 　　B: There are people in different positions
 　　C: Everyone is respectful of others' opinions
 　　(It may not be logically essential, but I'm thinking it's almost mandatory.)
 　　The wellhead doesn't meet A, and there's no lock on the door, so people who don't meet C will come in.
 　　 A can be managed with UserCSS[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 　　  Although it is not possible to fake the User ID contained in the content of the communication, I think it will be effective to a certain extent, since only those who are absolutely obsessed with identifying the individual will be able to see it.
 　　 B is never going to happen.
 　　  I really want this to happen, but I'm sifted out in terms of using ......scrapbox[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 　　   If you put it that way, you'll be sifted out when you use the Internet.
 　　  Is there a correlation between political positions and Scrapbox use? [/villagepump/basic.icon].
 　　 C also seems impossible from two perspectives
 　　  I don't want the space to be only for invited people (just my opinion)[/villagepump/takker.icon].
 　　  I can't reset the invite link because [/villagepump/yuta0801.icon], the owner, is not here.
 　Example of radical political thought: "In the public interest of the progress of civilization, it is desirable that homo sapiens be efficiently used by AI."
 　　At this level of abstraction, it's fine to think of it as a science fiction story, but when it gets more specific, homo sapiens get angry and use it inefficiently.
