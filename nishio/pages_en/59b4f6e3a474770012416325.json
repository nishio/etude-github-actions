>Therefore, to eliminate the human factor from knowledge as "arbitrary" would deny the tacit process of "knowing," which can never be reduced to manipulation, and thus destroy knowledge itself. It is widely held that "tacit knowledge" is simply equated with "unspeakable knowledge," but this is a misunderstanding, as pointed out by Ayumi Yasutomi.

>Nonaka defined "tacit knowledge" as "knowledge based on experience or intuition that is difficult to express in words or other means," and opposed it to "formal knowledge" to construct his theory of knowledge management. Nonaka classifies "tacit knowledge" into two dimensions, including the cognitive dimension, in addition to the technical dimension. This tacit knowledge theory of Nonaka is fundamentally different from Polanyi's theory and should be seen as Nonaka's own "ingenuity.
