Combination of procrastination and perfectionism
>When [procrastination] habit and [perfectionism] are combined, "the incentive to procrastinate is strengthened by the prospect of oneself suffering from the inability to perfect the task, and the perfectionist tendency is strengthened by the procrastination to finish the task even when it is started". It tends to create a hell where nothing remains even though you suffer terribly from the task.
