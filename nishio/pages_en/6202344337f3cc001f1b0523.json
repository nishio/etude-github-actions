It's refuted over and over again.
One person A makes an assertion X and is [refuted] Y by another person.
Then again, A makes the claim that X, and again is refuted Y.
A thinks that X is right and Y is wrong, and he is uncomfortable with the coming of the rebuttal Y.
And yet, if you insist on repeating X, that's [insanity] [the insanity of doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different result].

Whether X is right and Y is wrong, vice versa, or neither is determined from this condition alone.
ã€€(It is often done to infer that X would be wrong because A is being raped by insanity, but there is no guarantee that this inference is correct.)
