Don't try to create a perfect library.
[https://gyazo.com/9f6415ca3442460d69fcfdd68e2cd6fe]
	We want to eliminate or reduce to 0% the writing of code for the same purpose (A) and
		Different input types and so on.
			It could be an array, std::vector, etc.
		Requires slightly different codes and lots of options.
		It is necessary to remember that there is an implemented code
		Needs to be properly documented.
	Costs are inflated by such factors as
		Cost-effective
		[Bad perfectionism]
	The idea of A is not beneficial.
	If you don't create a library, you are 100% "writing code for the same purpose".
		Creating a library will cut down on that a bit.
		It's important to think B.

I made a note of this because I talked with [Mr. Kawai] about this.
