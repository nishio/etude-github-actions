(5.3.1.1) Skip nameplate making
Sometimes, I skip the "[nameplate making]" phase. It is a method to ease the burden of too much information. 

Jiro Kawakita proposed to repeat the nameplate making and further grouping until the pieces became several groups. Since making a nameplate is useful for understanding what good group organization is, it is important to experience it several times.
However, once you understand what a good group organization is, I think you can skip it in your daily work.

In my case, I made nameplates when I made the table of contents from 600 pieces of paper. 

After that, by dividing it into chapters, the number of pieces become 60 to 100 pieces. I did not make nameplates for those. I skip the phase and go "[spatial arrangement]" phase directly.

Of course, if I come up with something new during the process, I write it to prevent it disappears.
