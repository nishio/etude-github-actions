 *1386215013*"A Surprising Book to Recommend to Tech People" Afterword
 <a href='http://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/?p=13515'>I wrote an article in Cybozu's Advent Calendar</a>. I introduced "What is Drama - An Introduction to Story Engineering" as "A Surprising Book to Recommend to Techies. Well, you can see the full story there, but I'll try to write a kind of postscript here.
 
 
 In the main article over there, I wrote, "I don't know if learning story engineering will help you," but it did, at least for me. To the extent that I could write that article in 25 minutes. It's a shallow knowledge that I've only read one book about, but it's applied in many ways in that entry. Let me explain a little.
 
 
 
 The first thing to do early on is to "explain the 'penetrating action' that runs through the entire story" and "launch it with sufficient initial speed". So, in the first few lines, I explain that the main thrust of the story is to "recommend a surprising book to a techie".
 
 
 In the next few lines, he gives a book recommendation and says, "Surprising, isn't it?" I say. The protagonist claims it's surprising, but the reader doesn't find it surprising; in other words, it's "conflict generation and resolution." I also wrote in the book, "When the protagonist doesn't make a move, the environment makes the move. In this case, the protagonist's "Surprising, isn't it?" The environment (the imaginary reader) responds to the protagonist's "Surprising, isn't it? Really? The protagonist is supposed to respond to the reader's reaction by saying, "That's surprising, isn't it? Then the protagonist moves to counter that.
 
 This is a blog post, so the main character = my own story, but if you want to use a conversational style, for example, you can use the following
 
 >>
 Dr. N. "This time, I would like to introduce you to 'story engineering. What do you think?
 A. Assistant "What, where?"
 Dr. N. "It's surprising! In the first place."
 <<
 
 So it would be something like.
 
 
 
 After this, we return to the through-and-through action and perform the "make a recommendation". Again, the protagonist takes the dare to "literally make a recommendation," and the fictional reader confronts him with "Eh, give me a reason why you recommend it. Then we do another "conflict generation and resolution".
 
 From this point on, the story reaches its climax, and the main character is on the rampage. It's like the brush is running on its own, or the main character is moving on its own. It's easy to get into that kind of situation with a blog post because the main character is me. This article, too, is a protagonist running around from beginning to end, without any particular design.
 
 Well, even though I say I will move on my own, I do the KJ method in advance.
 
 
 
 The final sime is "I don't want to recommend", "I don't know if it would be useful", and "I find it interesting to challenge myself in a way that I have found surprising in the past". I have once discarded both "unexpected" and "recommend" in the penetrating action. On top of that, the "unexpected" that should have been discarded before comes back. By switching the subject to the "past self. You say, "I don't want to recommend it," but in the end, you do recommend it. This is not "this book," but "the challenge.
 
 So, as a whole, it is a common pattern that "as a result of trying to avoid the initially declared 'goal,' the 'goal' is eventually achieved, although in a different way than initially expected.
 
 
 
 Well, I've explained it like this, but to be honest, this book is written for dramatic, long stories with several climaxes. I don't think it is suitable for short shorts or blog posts. I haven't finished reading the book yet, but I found the following link: "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4901769561/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN= 4901769561&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">How to make a small story</a>" might be interesting. Not sure if it would be useful for you.
