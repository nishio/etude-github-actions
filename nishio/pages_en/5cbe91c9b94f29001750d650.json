Real-world examples of policy constraints
In his theory of constraints, Goldratt divided "[constraints]" into "[physical constraints]" and "[policy constraints].
[Policy constraints] are constraints created by the human mind.

This "past year" constraint is a policy constraint.

I don't know the reason for this "restriction".
Perhaps there is a clear reason for this.
Even so, if there are benefits in the absence of constraints,
	Advantages in case of constraints
	Advantages when there are no restrictions
should be compared to consider whether to maintain the constraint.
By suggesting, "Why don't we remove the constraint?" if there is a reason, it gets verbalized; if there is no reason, the constraint gets removed. Either way, it is a step in the right direction.
