(0.2.1) Collect information concretely
The first step in learning is gathering information concretely.
When you study programming, in most cases, you read the program which others wrote, for example, sample codes in a textbook. The technique "[Shakyo]" is often used in Japan. 

Originally [Shakyo] ([Shakyo], Sutra copying) means the East Asian Buddist practice of hand-copying Buddhist sutras. Initially it was important to write Initially it was important to write without changing a single word at a time, but today in the context of programming education, simply reading a short code, entering it into a computer, and running it to see the behavior. Details in [(1.3.4.1) Shakyo].

This activity is concrete information gathering. 

Programming textbooks show you some problems and the program to solve it. This book also introduces problems in intellectual production and their solution. It has the same structure.
