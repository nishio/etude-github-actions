Favors of the people
xl 

It is hard work to gain universal admiration, or more specifically, universal love. Some depend on one's innate nature, more on one's practice. The former is the foundation upon which the latter is built. The brilliant part is a prerequisite, but it is not enough. With a good reputation, it is easy to gain favor. Generating feelings of kindness requires even more acts of kindness. Do good things with both hands, good words and better deeds, and love as you are loved. Politeness is the political magic of great men. First the hand on the deed, then the pen, and the word follows the sword.
