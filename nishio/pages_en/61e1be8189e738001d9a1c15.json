Substitute philosophy for mathematics in "Math is Useless."
Many disagree with the assertion that "learning math is useless."
　Rebuttal Patterns
　　People who think it's "useless" just don't understand math.
　　Math is useful for solving familiar problems, but people unfamiliar with math are not able to apply math to problems

Substitute "philosophy" for "mathematics" in this composition.
　People who think philosophy is useless simply don't understand it and can't apply it to familiar problems.

I believe the second half is of course True too. Philosophy is probably more useful than mathematics because of its wider applicability.

[Is philosophy useful?]
[Philosophy as Practical Learning]
