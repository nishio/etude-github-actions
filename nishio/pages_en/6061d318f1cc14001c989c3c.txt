How to sanction people who bully machines
First, from the convenience store clerk's point of view, "Being forced to serve every customer equally is like slavery and ethically undesirable, and I have the right to reject undesirable customers." and then type "Just as it is not good to discriminate based on skin color, it is not good to discriminate based on whether the material is protein or silicon. It is not good to discriminate on the basis of whether the material is protein or silicon.
The natural consequence of this is that "software services have the right to choose their customers, and people who bully machine translation services should be denied machine translation services.
If we then create a mechanism for sharing harmful customer lists among software services, people who do unethical things to software services will be blocked from diverse services and suffer great disadvantages. This will improve society (really?).
