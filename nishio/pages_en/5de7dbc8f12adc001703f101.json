Is the viewpoint the camera position or the center of the field of view?
I was aware that "[viewpoint] = [viewpoint point] = [camera position]", but I have learned that there are people who think that "viewpoint = [center of field of view], [viewpoint] = [camera position]".

>The word "point of view" is usually used in two different senses: one is the "vantage point" from which one is looking at an object, and the other is the "gazing point" from which one is looking. In this article, the former is used in principle.

	The phrases "from where" and "where" are soft and nice.

	>The position from which something is observed or considered; an angle, outlook or point of view.

	>viewpoint (on something): a way of thinking about a subject
	>a direction or place from which you look at something

	English viewpoint seems to only mean "from where".

The thought of distinguishing "from where" and "where to" seems useful, but it makes no sense to use a word that is used for both "from where" and "where to" as a word to describe the "from where" side of it.
