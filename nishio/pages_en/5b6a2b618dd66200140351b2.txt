Three kinds of anger and usefulness
I had a friend who claimed that "[anger is] beneficial" and I thought "anger is basically harmful", but then it occurred to me that there are different kinds of anger. #Anger is toxic to you

	Anger toward others
 Anger over transitory events
	Anger at the ongoing system

Of the three, anger at the ongoing system is useful. It's the driving force that leads to systemic improvements.
