>[Proof of preparedness is important to convey your point of view.] And the best way to show your preparedness online is to [show your face] [real name]. You risk your connections and your credibility because it's in your history. People who have something to claim but are afraid of this suffer from the dilemma of having something to say but not being able to say it.

>Why people with real names are more likely to listen to you than [anonymous]. I once had a person who met with an anonymous person who was interested in the same social issue, only to find out later that the person was an antisocial person and asked me for advice. It is still ok to communicate with anonymous people online, but it is very risky to actually connect with them.

>If disclosure is asymmetric, only one side is at risk. Either both remain anonymous or both use their real names. The real name connection creates a stronger bond because the risk is shared and cannot be escaped. As a result, communities in the real-name world are stronger.
