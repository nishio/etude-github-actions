I want the Regroup to open with one click from the 🤔chat log.
　How to do it.
　Generate Regroup map data on the server side and then open it.
　　[✅Map Regroup in Python].
　	画面構成案
	　　[Sticky layout of Regroup map generated from Keicho's logs].
 　[Regroup変換を試す]
　　[✅Make the selected keywords a sticky].
　　[✅Briefly sticky some of the questions].
　Make it work on a ✅ server
 　Just let the link suggestion API server do all the work.
 　 Firestoreから読んで書く
 　 Would you prefer keicho's server?
 　 Rather bring link suggestions to keicho server?
 　 The current Regroup export does not use link suggestion results.
 　 Start small and do it on keicho server.
 　 I had a server set up on Heroku specifically for this, not link suggestions.
 　Right now I'm working on a repository on Keicho's server.
 　　The ID is hard coded, reads the local log, and outputs it with a fixed map ID.
 　　　That's more convenient for experimentation.
 　　✅Receive ID in request to this, read from Firestore and make a path to create a new one.


　Place a spinner on Keicho's side.
　　Copy URL dialog when complete
　　　Because it is asynchronous, it is blocked when tabs are opened
　　No, the dialog is displayed when the menu is pressed, and the URL is displayed when the generation is finished, or
　　Can we do without the spinner?
　　✅Trigger map generation from Keicho menu

　If we can do this, I'd be tempted to include just multi-line text instead of chat logs.
