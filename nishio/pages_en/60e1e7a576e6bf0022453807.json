N予備校
[N予備校 https://www.nnn.ed.nico/]
I'm interested in what [N High School] is doing as a new form of education, but I don't want to go back to high school... and then I heard that they also have a prep school.
I would assume that a prep school is for college entrance exams, but it looks like it still includes video editing courses and a monthly fee.
