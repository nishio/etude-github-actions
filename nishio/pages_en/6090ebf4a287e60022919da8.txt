 *1197895531* Offline meeting tomorrow unexplored.
 As some of you may already know from the program, I will be a panelist for the panel discussion.
 
 I'm scared. I'm scared. I can't give an impromptu answer!
 
 *1197896589*1000 Speakers Project
 There were a lot of confusion about the name of the conference, such as "a conference for people who want to talk," "a meeting to expose oneself," or "the 1000 speakers project," but we decided to call it the "1000 speakers project. However, this is the name of a project to hold small conferences, so the name of the conference has not been decided yet. I wonder if "1000 Speakers Conference-less" is okay.
 
 Also, there has been some talk of holding a conference in the Kansai region as early as this year. I myself do not think it is necessary for us to run all the conferences to fulfill the objective of "giving 1,000 people a chance to make their debut as a lecturer," but I was persuaded by the opinion that it would be a mess and eventually collapse if we start out by saying, "If you agree, we will do the same thing in other parts of Japan! However, I was persuaded by the opinion that if we start with the idea of "If you agree with us, we will do the same thing in other parts of Japan," it would be a mess and eventually fail, so for the time being, we will not create branches. Instead, we are going to publish all the information about the problems we are facing.
 
 There are various conferences in Kansai, Kyushu, and Hokkaido, so it's good to have a good antenna. I think Keihanna in particular is one of the most frequent ones. This and ↓↓↓.
