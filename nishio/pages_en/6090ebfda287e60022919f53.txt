 *1236989566*Leverage memo: "So it's not getting done. And yet I don't have time." (draft)
 The abomination on your desk is your very life.
 
 Most people who are sloppy just have an unconscious aversion to "being neat".
 Contrary to their beliefs, creativity was enhanced by eliminating sloppiness.
 Unconscious rebellion against parents who tell them to "tidy up." The coupling of "tidying up" and "pain.
 
 Since you are the cause of the confusion, you are the only one who can change it.
 
 What kind of person do you want to be? The more specific you can envision, the closer you are to realization.
 The reason things are so hard to get rid of is because I feel at one with myself.
 People who can't get rid of things can't get rid of their plans either. Are those "things to do" really things to do?
 Postponing decisions is like throwing garbage into the future.
 Don't buy something that doesn't have a specific place to put it.
 Sloppiness becomes a talent when concentration is added.
 You can't do several at once. Set priorities and focus on one.
 TODOs are recorded on the list as soon as they come to mind. Motivation is an absolute prerequisite for the list. The trick is to break it down into smaller tasks.
 You can get a head start by choosing three "top priorities for the day."
 Set a time limit and set a timer.
 It's not that we don't have time. It's just that we don't have the courage to put the most important things first.
 
 A small step actually taken rather than a big step that did not materialize.
 You can't "change everything." You just need to decide on one place to start.
 
 When you clarify your objectives, you feel like you can achieve them. I can move by my own will, not by orders. I can see how far I have achieved.
 If you set a goal based on "how it should be," it is hard because you feel obligated to do so. You should decide by thinking, "What would make me happy?
 If you are not clear on what you want to get, think about what you don't like and aim to eliminate it.
 
 The "bifurcation effect": when you start cleaning up one area, you start worrying about other areas. Concentrate on the first place you decide to start and feel a sense of accomplishment when you complete it. You can't do everything at once.
 If you can do it for 21 consecutive days, the behavior becomes a habit.
 Don't be pessimistic by focusing only on what you "can't do. There are many things you can do.
 According to Conquering Chaos at Work, Disney CEOs devote 75% of their working hours to maintenance work. At first glance, maintenance may seem tedious, but without maintenance, creative work is impossible.
 1: Does it give you energy when you see it? 2: Do you like it no matter what anyone says? 3: Is it useful and do you actually use it? If no to all, you don't need it.
 
 Complete the task completely until you don't have to remember it later. Or put it in your TODO list so you don't have to remember it in your head.
 
 Estimating less than the actual time it will take is a major cause of remaining halfway through a task. It should be based on actual measurements, not assumptions.
 Even if you say, "This work will take a whole day, so you can do it when you have time," you will never have a whole day to work on it.
 When doing something new, consider the possibility that it will take twice as long as estimated; if you think you can do it in two days, it will take four.
 
 A 10 minute "transition time" is needed between tasks. You can't switch your mind right away.
 
 Sloppy people tend to be curious and easily distracted.
 
 Limit your list to the tasks you will perform that day. If you put them all on the list, it will be overwhelming and it will be difficult to see what needs to be done.
 It's counterproductive to fill in a list with every task you can think of, and every time you look at it, it depresses you. You can have a main list with a lot written on it, but you also need a list of just the tasks for the day.
 Do not save words on your task list. More time is lost by not being able to remember it or not being able to pin it down when you see it later than is lost by saving words.
 Rarely do people decide to change their lives and then immediately make it happen. Only those who fail and try again and again succeed.
 Custom is the Greek word "ethos," which at the same time means "character.

 A book I bought but left unread, if I don't read it, I should throw it away, but I don't feel comfortable throwing it away if I bought it but didn't read it, so I read it lightly in 7 minutes with the purpose of checking "whether it is worth reading" by "clarifying the purpose". Then I decided it was worth reading, so I redlined it in 25 minutes while taking a footbath for the purpose of "making a leverage memo and discarding the original copy". And now I wrote the above in 46 minutes for the purpose of "making a draft of the leverage memo". I will read it again tomorrow to complete the leverage memo and discard the original.

 *1237045110*today's taskpaper.el
 I almost thought it would be convenient when I heard "you can add tags and narrow down your search by those tags," but then I thought calmly, isn't a full-text search enough? When you think "this is housework," do you look it up in the dictionary and write "@housework" or "@kaji"? Or should I support writing "@housework"?
 
 I had a feeling it was the latter.

 >|lisp|
 (defun taskpaper-create-new-project (name)
  "Creates new project"
  (interactive "sProject Name: ")
  (insert (concat name ":\n\n")))
 ||<
 
 For a moment I wonder where the return value of (interactive "sProject Name: ") goes? I wonder if I don't have enough Lisp brain. Of course, it is passed to the function as an argument.

 I was able to get to the point where C-cC-s prompts "Search tag:" and when I type it, it runs a command for search with that as an argument (now it does nothing) and creates a new buffer with "*Taskpaper: tag=hoge*" and displays that.

 - Tag Search
 -- ■ C-cC-s prompts "Search tag:"
 -- ■ Execute a command for search using it as an argument when entered
 -- □ Search command returns search results
 -- ■ Display the results returned by the search command in a new buffer *Taskpaper: tag=hoge*.
 -- □ The results are appended, so erase them before writing
 -- Think about how to deal with the fact that the command and the input file are definitive.
