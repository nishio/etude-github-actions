Electronic KJ method tool
I would like to know if there is a good tool that can do [the KJ method] electronically.

one's own work

  Google Docs as a backend for collaborative editing
  [Regroup]

 	One that rearranges the slides on the VR space.

What they taught me

Scrapbox does not have the "spatial arrangement" function of the KJ method, but the process of idea generation is similar.
