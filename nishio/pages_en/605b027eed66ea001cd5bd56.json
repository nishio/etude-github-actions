>A lot of unintelligible automated posts by bots are put into a place where humans are creating page links and engaging in intellectual activity [and turning it into a garbage dump].
>The pages that are thrown in are not maintained with any links, etc.

Logically:.
　If you have a project where the bot writes separately from where the humans are active, why is that a problem?
　Why don't the BOT just maintain the link?
