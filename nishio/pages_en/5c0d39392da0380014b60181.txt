2018-08-07 Nishio received PDF
2018-08-08 Nishio returned 3 comments (at this time I was wondering if this comment would be answered and completed)
2018-08-20 Translation company informs "Native check completed, now double check by translator and in-house translator to complete".
2018-08-23 Nishio: "I can't download it because it says my download key is wrong."
	The other party will send and receive files via "Gigafile Mail".
2018-08-27 Translation company "uploaded again"
2018-09-05 Nishio: "What does this ask me to do? Is this asking me to do some work?"
2018-09-11 Nishio, urged for no reply
2018-09-12 Uploaded by translator, commentary and again
	A PDF with a lot of comments came up, so I'll go through it and comment on it.
2018-09-24 Nishio, comment back.
2018-09-24 Translation company "We have started to respond to your comments with the following delivery date. Delivery date: 10/9"
2018-11-02 Another person in charge of the subsidiary: "We have integrated our translation business into the subsidiary. We will take over in turn."
2018-11-12 Subsidiary "Uploaded all 13 files that are not official responses but have been answered by translators."
	The service we use has changed to a home file delivery service.
 And again, the zip file is password protected.
2018-11-19 Subsidiary Chapter 1 uploaded
	They say, "Please check," but what should I check?
	>"We skip over those that we don't know the corresponding part (A1, A2, etc. numbers are not numbered in the same way in our environment and cannot be assigned based on the content).
	What?
2018-11-23 Nishio: "I've read up to chapter 3 and don't know what to check. I don't know what I am expected to do."
2018-11-26 Subsidiary answer, not quite sure
2018-12-10 Nishio, I finally figured it out.
	>"We skip over those that we don't know the corresponding part (A1, A2, etc. numbers are not numbered in the same way in our environment and cannot be assigned based on the content).
 >"Please confirm."
	Does this mean that I have to check if the comments I wrote back in Word with Atari are in the right place and put the ones I couldn't find in the right place here?
 I mean, the comment numbers A1, A2, etc. were written on the PDF sent to me by the parent company in the first place... haha, so you are saying that the PDF was not transferred?
 â†’ I'll share the PDF for now.
