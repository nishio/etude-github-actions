tackman model
The opinion, asserted in 1965, that there are four phases in the formation process of an organization.
	Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing
	Assume that the four phases come in sequence
	This claim has not been experimentally verified.
[Tuckman's stages of group development - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development]

The modification that the four phases do not come in order [DAU model].
　Storm can happen anytime in Norm and Perform
　This is more realistic.
　We looked at 368 teams and found that this model fits better.
　　Only six cases follow the Tuckman model.
　DAU is the name of the university (Defense Acquisition University). Give it a more proper name, I feel.
