information transmission network
Until now, when I think about [information][transmission] networks, I've implicitly thought about [information transmission] between companies.
On the other hand, as the company gets bigger, if everyone [broadcasts] to everyone, it will be a [notification flood],
If we separate the information transmission network for each department, we will end up with a "takotsubo" situation, and the composition will be the same.
