	>>I feel that the nature of an outliner as a "collection of sentences" is not always recognized by those who develop outliners. Outliners that are aware of this have a "focus" feature to support this (also called "zoom," "hoist," "wind-up," etc., depending on the outliner). In a nutshell, it is a feature that temporarily displays any item in the outline as the top level of the hierarchy. The other items will not be visible, so you can concentrate on that item. - See "Introduction to Outline Processing" in the "Outlines" section.
