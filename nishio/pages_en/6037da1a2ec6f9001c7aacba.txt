	Total Amount of Resources, which is a kind of score.
	The play style of accumulating mana is too strong, so let's nerf it in a developmental way.

			Manna is condensed and halved when 100 or more are collected (record the number of condensations to unlock the achievement)."

 		Mining and mana don't go hand in hand, and that's not fun, so mining-enhancing magic it is."
	However, I'm wondering what magic changes what with the pickaxe, since the design raises mining production with pickaxe and lowers mining costs with electric power.
	Let's see if we can get mithril to produce something from the iron mines.
	I went to bed and woke up and thought, in RPG terms, it's normal to have a cap on MP, so let's make it so you can't accumulate more than a certain amount, and then the cap can be raised by investment, etc.
