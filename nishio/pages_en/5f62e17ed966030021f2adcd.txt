AtCoder Library Practice Contest
The [AtCoder Library] has been released and two contests using it are scheduled. In other words, you should learn how to solve these contests in advance, since the choices of how to solve them are narrowed down in advance. The contest for practice is open to the public, so you can solve it. [ACLPC].
