	The most "easy-to-understand" philosophy textbook I've read.
		I guess "easy to understand" is different for everyone. I don't have a problem with the old font.
  The PDF above is not the one I read, but the old kana usage has been changed to the new one.
	The [theory of truth] section of the book has helped me a lot in my commentary on [correctness].
