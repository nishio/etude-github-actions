Communities and their Crushers
[Truly scary "community crashers" with a warped need for approval, pulling down leaders with false innuendos | Caricone News https://news.careerconnection.jp/?p=24425]
 attack pattern
 	Spreading rumors behind the backs of key members. It is judged that "where there is no fire, there is no smoke."
  Repeat the lie.
 	Befriend important people and get "rounded up" when their behavior is called into question.
  Putting pressure on the weak and turning them into henchmen. Use henchmen to replace their own opinions with "everyone else's".
  If you see it as a problem, you evade pointing it out by creating an atmosphere of hassle.
	Sources of Action
 	desire for approval
  When you don't get respect in the community, you satisfy your need for approval by tearing someone down.
 cope
		If maintaining the community is important to you, you have to purge.
		Gather facts and denounce them in front of a large audience that includes important people.
  The crusher is preserved by the feeling that it is a hassle or mental hardship (the feeling of a free rider who does not pay the cost of maintaining the community).
