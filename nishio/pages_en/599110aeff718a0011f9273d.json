Coefficients and probabilities of logistic regression
	Logistic regression [$ P(y|X) = \sigma(W^tX)].
 Definition of sigmoid [$ \sigma(ax) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-ax)}]
 As for probability, it's an [S-shaped] curve, so it's not a matter of how many times the probability increases as the coefficient increases.
 Consider odds p / (1 - p)
 [$ \frac{p}{1 - p} = \frac{\frac{1}{1 + \exp(-ax)}}{1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-ax)}} = \frac{1}{(1 + \exp(-ax)) - 1} = \frac{1}{\exp(-ax)}]
 So the odds are e times lower when the coefficient increases by one.
