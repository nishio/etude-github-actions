Stable Diffusionの画像サイズの影響
As for whether the sampling method is [DDIM] or [PLMS], there is some difference, but it is not so obvious to the human eye

Rather, the effect of size is so great that it's a completely different thing.

If the composition is the same even if it is small, I tried the "generate many at high speed at a small size and then select the best ones for higher resolution" approach, but it didn't work at all.

[Stable Diffusion] [LDM] does [diffusion model] in latent space.
　Not a diffusion model in the space of a small image and then [super-resolution] approach.
　Perhaps that's why.
