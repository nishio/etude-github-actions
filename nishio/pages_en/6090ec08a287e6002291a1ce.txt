 *1320906354*I read between the lines of variational Bayesian and wrote the information into the graphical model.
 I am studying variational Bayes. It is hard to read between the lines of the equations and the graphical model because they are written only minimally. I finally understood a little and tried to write it in a graphical model using my own notation.
 First, regarding the graphical model of the mixed normal distribution, the graphical model expresses the dependencies among variables and does not describe how they depend on each other or unnamed values that do not appear in the equation. Therefore, it is necessary to fill in the missing information when implementing the model. The random variable Y, which does not appear in the equation, is determined from the parameters μ and Σ by a "Gaussian distribution," and the random variable Z is determined from the parameter π by a "multinomial distribution. The observed variable X is determined by Y^Z.

 What I wanted to do with the variational Bayesian story was to Bayesize these parameters first. To Bayesize means to consider them as random variables and introduce a prior distribution. The conjugate prior of a Gaussian distribution becomes a Gaussian Wishart distribution, and the conjugate prior of a multinomial distribution becomes a Dirichlet distribution. And each of those distributions has another new parameter.

 I finally know what I want to do. The road to implementation is long...
 
 *1320922212* ipython prompt was corrupted -> resolved
 For some reason, once I quit ipython and started it again, the prompt went wrong. reset and restarting Terminal.app didn't fix it.

 I don't know what I messed with...
 
 I had been struggling with this for a while, but when I started ipython, there was a warning about readline, so I did sudo port install py27-readline and it fixed it. Hmmm, I wonder what was the cause.
