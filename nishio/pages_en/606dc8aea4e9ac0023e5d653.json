âœ…Discount keywords in short sentences
If keyword extraction normalizes the score to a maximum of 100, keywords with a score of 100 are created from each input, creating a dumpling.

I would like to improve the selection among the dumplings as it would be a matter of luck. Ideally, we'd like to learn the degree to which keywords are a good target for questions, but we'd need almost the equivalent of a dictionary, and we don't have enough data yet.

So, as a simple heuristic, we introduced "the best keyword in a long sentence is better than the best keyword in a short sentence" and "a longer keyword in the same sentence is better".
