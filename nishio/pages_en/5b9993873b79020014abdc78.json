Are you okay with learning what you want to learn?
[首都大学東京 情報通信特別講義2017]
	Student> I enjoy learning what I want to learn, but I'm afraid I'll lose myself if I do it all the time.
 Komachi Mamoru> I was fortunate to succeed in doing what I wanted to learn.
 	[nishio.icon]Is this the idea that "the future is [agnostic], determined by [luck], so there's no point in worrying about it"? #Future is agnostic
 Nishio> I think that if we can improve our skills in "learning things that are not in the textbooks," we will be fine even if we change fields in the future.
 Kohei Okubo> You can learn business too. Or get along with people who are good at it. Either of these is a must.
 Shinji Kono> People who choose only what they don't enjoy don't seem to have fun... If you learn deeply, you will naturally broaden... Relationships too.
 Yoshiki Shibukawa> I think that studies (mathematics, physics, computer science, philosophy, etc.) that have [the ability to describe the world] can be applied immediately when you go to other fields.
