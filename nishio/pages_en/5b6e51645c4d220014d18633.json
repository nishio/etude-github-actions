The results briefing is not a goal, but a start.
	The idea that PM/OB/PG have repeatedly conveyed at [unexplored] events, etc., not only to me but also to other PM/OB/PG.
 [The debriefing session is not a goal, but a start.

  How I will run after this from the starting line of the results debriefing.
	The same goes for [writing]. [Publishing is] not a goal, but a start.
  Software is not finished [when it is released], and there are version upgrades.
  Would the version upgrade in the book be an expanded and revised edition?
  That makes me think that an expanded and revised edition could come out in three years...

[start, not goal].
