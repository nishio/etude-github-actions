 23/29. ugisudani has gone to Tabata's position and Nippori-Nishinippori in between is missing. Also, you wrote Meguro but forgot Mejiro.
 
 
 It seems that there are some people in the world who can memorize things just by writing them down without any effort, but you should consider that as a talent. At least, I can't remember even if I just write it down. So, I take an approach to make it easier to be caught in the net by adding incidental information such as "where it is located" to fatten up the information. The head is split, like a lickety-split," "Tokyo is in half the city," "Osaki is the southernmost point, Shinagawa is next," "Shinagawa, Tamachi, and Hamamatsucho are by the sea," and so on.
 
 So, as for the six cases I couldn't remember, I'll fatten them up even more.

 Nippori is a Higurashi-sato. There is Higurashi Elementary School. Kaisei High School is also located here. The line runs down to the right, so you can see that it is on the right shoulder. Mejiro is up on the right, so it is on the left shoulder. Otsuka is crossed by the Arakawa Line, the only streetcar line in Tokyo, running north-south. The Arakawa Line, the only tram line in Japan, runs from north to south, which means that the line runs from east to west, so naturally it is located at the head of a lickspittle. Harajuku is to the east of Yoyogi Park, and Shibuya Ward begins just below. Between Yoyogi and Shibuya, you can see that it is north of Shibuya. Gotanda is rather troubled. Gajoen in Meguro was included in the map, but it is hard to relate it as information. I will have to do my best to remember Mejiro and Gotanda.

 Too nostalgic.

 Inspired by a certain person, I started taking notes on paper on 2008-03-18. I ran out of the 100 sheets of copy paper I bought at Daiso, so I moved on to another sheet of paper. The sequential number was 66, which means I discarded one out of every three sheets.
 
 I like the idea of this kind of accumulation. howm or something like that would have been fine (although I would have preferred a digital method of note-taking for ease of retrieval), but it didn't last. I guess the ease of drawing diagrams and the physical "feeling of accumulation" were important.
 
 If I had a time machine, I'd want my elementary school self to get into this habit. I want to read what you were thinking.

 <body>Ah. I hadn't thought of that>Hiragana<br>Could people who learned by ear while riding the train to school be in a state of "what's next, but I know the sound and don't know the kanji"? </body>
