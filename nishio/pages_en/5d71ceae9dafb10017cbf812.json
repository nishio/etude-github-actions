		原題は「Things that gain from disorder」「無秩序から得られるもの」
		This is a straightforward title since anti-fragility is a concept that focuses on the amount of benefit gained from uncertainty

		Traditionally, uncertainty has been considered "harmful"
			We have been calling those that suffer more harm from uncertainty "fragile" and those that suffer less "robust".
		But uncertainty has benefits as well as harms
			The greater gain from uncertainty is called "anti-fragility."

>Taleb's 2007 book, "Black Swan: The Nature of Uncertainty and Risk," sold 1.5 million copies in the United States after the Lehman Brothers collapse, which was triggered by the subprime mortgage meltdown.
>Taleb says anti-fragility means having options. Options are what make us anti-fragile. With options, we can benefit from the positive side of uncertainty without being seriously harmed by the negative side of uncertainty.
