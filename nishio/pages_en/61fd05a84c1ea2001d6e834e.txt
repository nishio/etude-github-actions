RELEVANCE(v1)
from ["Experiential Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Session 1].
RELEVANCE(v1)
　However, there are cases where symbols that are not symbolic of that "one felt meaning" promote understanding
　　[In some cases, symbols that are not symbols of "one felt meaning" promote understanding (v1)].
　Relevance is "that kind of related felt meaning whereby the symbolization is thereby made intelligible."
	　>relevant felt meanings, from out of which symbolization is understandable
	　[nishio.icon]Understand is used for this "understanding", which is different from the COMPREHENSION translation "understanding"
　Here's what they say in everyday conversation
　　>To understand, we need "past experience".
  >"[Context]" must be understood.
 >A set of symbols comes to be understood with the help of many other experienced meanings, not just the one felt meaning they represent (p. 158).
　[unintelligible description of RELEVANCE]
　Example: "A beginner learns a saying; after more than 20 years of experience, he understands the meaning of the saying in a different and more complete way, but when he tries to teach it to his student, he cannot find a better expression (=symbolization) for its meaning than the first word he learned 20 years ago."
 　[nishio.icon]That's a common one in math books.
 　 When I first saw the definition of a certain mathematical concept, I didn't know what it meant.
 　 I read various examples and explanations and think, "I see what you mean.
 　 I took another look at the definition, thinking, "Why didn't you just write that?" and that's exactly what it said.
 RELEVANCE is a type of symbolization
 　[nishio.icon]I'm not sure.
 Two Perspectives
 　It is possible to say that METAPHOR/COMPREHENSION is also a RELEVANCE, just as it is possible to say
 　But instead of doing so, Eugene Gendlin argues, it is better to see it as two perspectives (p. 159).
 　[nishio.icon]I drew it on the picture.

 	[Whether meaning determines relationship or relationship determines meaning (v1)]
　　[Meaning determines the relationship or the relationship determines the meaning.]
