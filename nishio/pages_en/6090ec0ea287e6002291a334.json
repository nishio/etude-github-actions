 *1440085561* Today's Shiritori
 A five-syllable word beginning with x and ending with x+1 (ignoring voiced and semivoiced sounds)
 
 postpaid → residence → Uranobon party → Ebisu face → cheering song → dryer → precious metals → rotten → modern language → capacitor → sakura rice → sirona gas → gap wind → all gurus → under the sleeve → drummers → by region
 
 To be continued.

 I had a dim memory that the last time I did it, I listed all the "x→x 5 syllables" and ended up with "Warsaw", so I tried "x→x+1", which was unexpectedly difficult. After I finished, I checked and found that the last time I did it was "x→x" with no character limit. To begin with, Warsaw is 4 syllables.
