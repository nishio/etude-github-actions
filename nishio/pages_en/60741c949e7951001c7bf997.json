Proposal support mode for making
This is a purpose-specific mode of Keichobot, a chatbot that helps people who propose creating something new to persuasively explain why it is necessary to create it.

how to start
　https://keicho.netlify.app/#mode=value_hypothesis

procedure
　As we begin, we start with six questions (the question text changes a bit depending on the situation).
		Who is it for?
		What would you like to see happen to that person?
		What needs to happen for that to happen?
		What kind of things would make it so?
		What made you think that way?
		What can you do to help?
 Once you have answered the six questions, you will be asked to dig deeper based on your answers up to that point.
 　Answering this will clarify the meaning of the words you used
 You can answer the six questions again from the beginning by pressing the "Again" button.
 　By repeating the process several times, you will gradually refine the story of why it is important to make this

how it ends
	There is no end to the dialogue, so you can leave and ignore the program's questions at any time.

examples showing the use (of a word)
　[support for proposal to create something new].
	[create a system that motivates people to chat with each other].

relevance
　The base questions are [Value Hypothesis Sheet], but after using it several times, a "Trigger Question" and a "What You Can Do Question" have been added

[listening chat system].
