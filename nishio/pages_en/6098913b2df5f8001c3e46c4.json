Justify the reprinting of key account postings.
Consider a private Twitter account with more than 100 followers ("key account") that posts to a private account with more than 100 followers ("key account") and then a public account reprints the post.
Some people may naively think it's something you shouldn't do, but this page justifies it on the basis of [copyright law], saying it's something you can do.

First, we need to get the [citation] in shape.
For example, clearly indicate the source. Make it clear who posted it, without making the account name a mosaic or anything like that. Links should also be included.
Also, minimize the amount of content to be critiqued rather than simply reprinting it.

Then, based on Article 32, he argues that "what has been published can be quoted and used.

(Japanese) Copyright Act
> (citation needed)
> Article 32 A work that has been published may be quoted and used. In this case, the quotation shall be in conformity with fair practice and within the scope justifiable for the purpose of news reporting, criticism, research and other quotations.

[Agency for Cultural Affairs commentary: https://pf.bunka.go.jp/chosaku/chosakuken/naruhodo/answer.asp?Q_ID=0000304]
>The widely accepted practical standards of judgment are provided by numerous precedents, including the Supreme Court decision (First Appellate Court of the Photo Parody Case, March 28, 1980). For example, 1) Master-servant relationship: both the quoting party and the quoted party must have a master-servant relationship in terms of quality and quantity. 2) Clear demarcation: both parties must be clearly demarcated. 3) Necessity: it must be inevitable why the quotation should be cited.

Next, "Are the key account posts [published]?" discussion.
Under Article 18, he argues that "publication means to offer or present to the public."
> (Right of Publication)
> Article 18 An author shall not make public his/her work which has not yet been made public (including works made public without his/her consent). The same shall apply hereinafter in this Article). Article 18 The author shall have the right to offer or present to the public his/her work (including works published without his/her consent) which has not yet been made public. The same shall apply to derivative works based on such works.

So what is "[public]"? This is defined in Article 2.
> (Definition)
> Article 2 In this Act, the meanings of the terms listed in the following items shall be as prescribed respectively in those items.
>5 "Public" as used in this Act shall include specific and numerous persons.
He argues that "100 is a large number," and that "even if the key account is only viewable by certain people, if the number of followers is large, the post is presented to the public and has already been published."

Connecting all of this together, he argues that it is a right granted by copyright law to quote a post from a key account with more than 100 followers on a public account.

----- PS: How many or more is a majority?
>Takukuni Mitsunaga I was curious about this, so I looked it up.
>More than 50 people is a large number in the eyes of the Agency for Cultural Affairs.
>300 people is a large number in the case law.

	Tokyo District Court, February 29, 2000, HANREI JIHO No. 1715, p. 76
　The "Hidetoshi Nakata, the man who led Japan to France" case: first trial.
　'Was the content published in a middle school yearbook distributed to 300 people?' Yes, 300 is a large number.
>The plaintiff (Hidetoshi Nakata), a soccer player, wrote a book entitled "Hidetoshi Nakata: The Man Who Led Japan to France" written by the defendant author and published by the defendant publisher (Line Books Co., Ltd.).... The publication of a poem ("Goal") from his junior high school days... Moral rights... The case involved a claim that the publication of a poem from his junior high school days ("Goal") in the book "Hidetoshi Nakata: The Man Who Led Japan to France" infringed on his moral rights....
>(iii) Issue 3 (Infringement of the right of publicity)
> 1 Infringement of the right of publicity is recognized when a work that has not been published or a work published without the author's consent is offered or presented to the public (Copyright Act, Article 18(1)).
> Since the poem is a work of language (Article 10(1)(i) of the Law), it can be said to have been published when it is published (Article 4(1) of the Law), and "publication" in the right means that a sufficient number of copies have been made and distributed to satisfy the public demand according to its nature (Article 3(1) of the Law). (Article 2(5) of the said Act).
> According to the evidence (B1, B4), this poem was published in the "School Year Book" of Kofu Municipal Kita Junior High School in 1991, and more than 300 copies of this book were distributed to the teachers of the junior high school and graduates of the same school in total.
> According to the facts as admitted to the right, the poem is considered to have been published because a sufficient number of copies were made and distributed to satisfy the demand of a large number of people (more than 300).
> In addition, since the plaintiff, the author of the poem, had consented to the poem being published in the yearbook, it can be said that he consented to it being published as of right.
> 3 Therefore, the plaintiff's claim based on infringement of the right of publication is without merit.
