Division and proliferation NFT
>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1572759023535157249 @nishio]: i'm starting to feel like [NFT] should have a [stock split] metaphor in it. If the NFT you own becomes popular and the price goes up, you split it 10 ways. The sellers would be able to lock in a portion of their profits while still owning a portion of the stock, and the buyers would not have to worry about the price becoming too high for them to buy. I wonder if this can be realized on top of the current structure.
	>For example, it is possible to increase the number of NFTs by img2img based on the former NFTs and then transfer them to the current owners, so that the NFTs can divide and multiply. The current system requires my labor, so if the number of people increases, it will not be possible.
 > For example, Mr. A buys one of the 8 cat face NFTs, and I img2img the NFT as a base and give him 7 new NFTs, so a new "series of 8" is created, which seems technically feasible so far, but I'm not sure how it will turn out after that.
 > In that case, Mr. A can get his money back if he can sell 2 of the 8 pieces for half price, but hmmm, this "child NFT" is just an NFT, so it's a bit delicate. If I guarantee "divide and multiply" for this NFT as well, it will collapse because my labor will increase exponentially...
 > I still need to make it so that the "right to divide and multiply NFTs" is granted only when some specific condition is met, and that actions to meet that condition have a positive effect on a series of NFTs. We are still missing a couple of pieces.

>I ate dinner and thought about it again.
>For example, if all 8 NFTs in a collection are sold, a "winning NFT" is drawn from the 8 NFTs, and a "child NFT" is created by img2img with the "winning NFT" as input and is given to the owner of the "winning NFT" free of charge. N NFTs are added to the collection separately, and when all of them are sold, another lottery is held.
>I thought this would work, but I'm afraid it's illegal in Japan. but I'm starting to think it's illegal in Japan.
>> The act of wealth lottery is the sale of certain numbered tickets or coupons and the subsequent distribution of unequal benefits among the purchasers by lottery or other chance methods.
>The highest bidder will get the NFT rights to divide and multiply when all the auctions are completed. There is room to strategize whether to bid high and aim for the NFT division and multiplication right, or to buy a lot at a low price.
>If only the highest bidder is allocated some resources, it is just an auction, so there is no legal problem, right? Rather, what would happen if the system was to leave aside the NFT divide-and-conquer right and give cash back to the highest bidder?
