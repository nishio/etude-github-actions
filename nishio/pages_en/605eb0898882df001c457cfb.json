It would be good if the policy on the content of the lecture is set and the content of the short lecture is verbalized.
summary
　Mention developments since the 2014 presentation
　The rightness of the decisions I wrote about in The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production.
　You can use the Scrapbox link for anything you remember from the chat.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]It would be good if the policy on the content of lectures is set and the content of short lectures is verbalized.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "lecture" is that "lecture"?
[nishio.icon]It's a lecture I'm giving in June, and I was caught off guard because I thought it was still a while away, but I already needed to submit a lecture outline.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "lecture"?
[nishio.icon]In our last chat, we talked about conveying "information that will have a beneficial effect on the audience's future life choices".
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "audience" is that "audience"?
[nishio.icon]A very low diversity group of students who are middle and high school students in an advanced school, some of whom go to the University of Tokyo.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "low population" is that "low population"?
[nishio.icon]The majority's pattern of behavior, to get into a university with a high deviation level for now, is not so bad, but while they are doing that, there are people in their age group who are using their minds to make a variety of choices about their lives, and they are behind the curve in terms of their skills.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "life" is that "life"?
[nishio.icon]With so many choices, it is difficult to know which option is the right one before making a choice. You wrote this in [The Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production]. I'm talking about [the correctness of decision-making].
[nisbot.icon]What "choice" is that "choice"?
[nishio.icon]That seems to be the key word. However, if I keep diverging, I might not get to the lecture outline, which is the purpose of this lecture, so I looked at the previous lecture, which was titled "Designing Learning Methods. The lecture material at that time subsequently led to "Intellectual Production Techniques for Engineers.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]Maybe I should talk about this kind of developmental process. Since I only do it in lectures at my alma mater; I gave a talk with the same title in 2014, and how it has developed since then.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen regarding that "lecture"?
[nishio.icon]I hope this will help young people in their future choices, but it's hard to apply simply telling the facts of my case.

 What does this "lecture" look like?
[nishio.icon][snowball], it's small, but once it starts rolling, it gets bigger and bigger. I wrote about this story in an article in the Technology Review.

 How do you know about this "lecture"?
[nishio.icon]The lecture material is posted on Scrapbox for you to read over. It would be good to specify the connection to the intellectual production techniques of engineers. Now I suddenly remembered that this "[rolling snowballs]" is [planned contingency]. It is also related to what you said about being observable after the fact.
[nisbot.icon]Where do these "lectures" come from?
[nishio.icon]I've done a lot of this kind of stuff before, so there's a network-like structure inside me and in Scrapbox, and if you hook into it and pull it out, the story will come out like a sack of potatoes.

 Where is this "lecture" located?
[nishio.icon]It's still a blur right now, I'm writing this chat log and hooks of things I remember in bits and pieces on the Scrapbox lecture preparation page.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "lecture"?
[It's in me, and it's in the process of fishing it out, pulling it out, putting it into words, and putting it in Scrapbox.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "Scrapbox" is that "Scrapbox"?
The [nishio.icon] pages are linked to each other, so it's easy to pull them out like a sack of potatoes.

 What is this "story" about?
[nishio.icon]There are a few specifics I can't remember at the moment, but the next action is to write what I almost remembered from this chat in Scrapbox and hook it firmly.
