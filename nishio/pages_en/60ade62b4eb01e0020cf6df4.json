strong core allocation
That the allocation [$ x] is a strong core allocation is
	[$ y_i \succsim_i x_i \quad \forall i \in T ]
	[$ y_j \succ_j x_j \quad \exists j \in T ]
 [$ \{y_i: i \in T\} = \{ w_i: i \in T\} ]
There must be no [$ T \subseteq I] and [$ y \in X] that satisfy
[Mechanism Design (book)] p.138

If it is a strong core allocation, it is efficient and individual rationality.

Individual Rationality:[$ x_i \succsim_i w_i \quad \forall i \in I]
	[$ w_i] is the initial holding
