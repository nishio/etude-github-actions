Unity's first-person view
 If the camera offset is (0, 1.4, 0.05), you can naturally see your own chest when looking down.

 	I first noticed you wearing the Unity mark accessory.
  This position is rather comfortable in relation to the arms, which are visible when you turn your head to the side.

  But if you look down very low, you can see inside your body.
  	In fact, it's already wedged into the body, and the head is too close to the camera to see the back side due to objects not being rendered.
   Is there an option to not draw backside polygons in the first place?
  When I turn my head to the side, my hair comes into view.
  In the meantime, I tried to Disable anything that might interfere.

 In fact, the facial bones should rotate as the camera direction moves.
 (0, 1.4, 0.15), it doesn't get stuck when you look down, but you can see the tip of the toes, which is a bit discomforting.
