　Thoughts.
　　Hmmm, I don't think I'll make it if I explore normally.
　　But it doesn't seem to be a DP to be fixed from the front since the scoring is not adjacent to each other.
　　　Even if you can get a high score in the front, it's possible that if you choose that, you won't get a score in the back.
　　I wonder if the NM is 100 at the highest, so I'll just graph it and solve it with flow.
　　　I wonder how you would describe the scoring thing when two vertices are selected.
　Official Explanation
　　Full search
　　C(20,10) is about 180,000
	　　So multiply it by 50 or so and you're still good to go.
