 *1225843896*Land of Mars/Venus
 I had heard about them selling land on the moon, but <a href="http://ck.jp.ap.valuecommerce.com/servlet/referral?sid=2517826&pid=877527507" target="_blank" ><img src="http://ad.jp.ap.valuecommerce.com/servlet/gifbanner?sid=2517826&pid=877527507" height="1" width="1" border="0">Before long, they are selling land on Mars and Venus They are even selling them. </a>
 >>
 From left to right, they are: a land title to Mars / a map of Mars / a constitution of Mars.

 When did they even make a constitution? I wonder what it says.

 *1225891733*There was no money at the time of payment.
 Happening as the title says.
 
 I timidly asked if I could use my credit card, but was told that I could not. I asked him if I could go and withdraw the money since I did not have it on hand, but he told me that a staff member was supposed to attend to me at the store and that I would have to wait a little while. I didn't have my bank card with me, so I went to a convenience store and used my credit card's cash advance facility. Watch out, watch out.
 
 
 However, the fact that the part-timers were able to answer the questions without any embarrassment must mean that they have a manual prepared for this kind of situation and have been properly trained. I wonder if this is actually a surprisingly common occurrence.
