Never be afraid to put it out there.
52 
Never to be humiliated is the great goal of prudence. It is the sign of a genuine human being and of a noble heart. For a generous heart is not easily extinguished. Passion is the humidity of the soul, and all its excesses weaken thought. If it overflows the mouth, reputation is at stake. Therefore, a man should be a very great master over himself, and nothing, whether in the most fortunate or in the most unfavorable circumstances, can harm his reputation by interfering with his self-control; rather, he can enhance it by showing his superiority.
