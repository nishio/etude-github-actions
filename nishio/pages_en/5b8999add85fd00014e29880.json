Do one thing you want to do every day
>"Always do one thing you want to do" every day. I don't think about whether it is right or not, or whether it will lead to success at all. Think not about whether it is good or bad, but why am I living this way, and just do what makes you happy. In order to take care of their own feelings, Japanese people need to start training themselves to start listening to themselves.

I was thinking, "I prefer to do something 'new' every day," which immediately created a sense of obligation to "do something new, I haven't done anything new lately, I have to [*do* something new]," an effect that added more burdens when my mind was tired and not doing anything new.

Maybe it is important to take away all the things that are right, that lead to success, that are new, that lead to learning, etc., and focus on what we want to do.
