It was titled "Dialectics through Continuum," but I began to feel it was too rigid, so I changed it to "Going backwards, but the goal is the same."

Dialectic by suspecting that what we think is "a point without magnitude" may actually have magnitude.

X and not X, proceeding to the right and to the left are reversed because of the assumption that the starting point is a single point, and if the starting point is a continuum, then the action C, "aiming at the center," is proceeding to the left for the right end and to the right for the left end. Here occurs the Aufheben that "X and not X are both C".
