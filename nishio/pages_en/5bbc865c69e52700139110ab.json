 [Abstraction is dimensionality reduction].
  [Dimensionality reduction is an abstraction].
 To begin with, there is no way that the brain is "calculating the inner product in order and looking for the closest one" to find vectors with a high degree of similarity.
  [LSH]?

  [The Boltzmann machine?
  Asociatron?

	Rather, is a neural net (if realized on a device capable of parallel computation) a device that can efficiently compute probabilistic Near Neighbor
 	The cost is just too high in making it happen with computers.
