> Mastodon searches are limited to usernames known to the server, hashtags that have been distributed by the server, and posts that you have been involved in (such as your own posts, or posts you have favorited).
> Note that text search of posts will not work unless enabled by the server administrator.
> While it may be frustrating not being able to collect other people's posts, I support the developer's opinion that the act makes the social networking site aggressive.
> If you have something you want to send out, you can use hashtags.
> I am at peace because I can't even egotize.
