 *1402837166* Visualizing chord progression in the fifth degree circle.
 The <a href='http://songle.jp/'>Songle</a> external embedded player can be customized with JavaScript, so I used it to create a <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%94%E5% BA%A6%E5%9C%8F'>I made a demo to visualize the five degree circle</a>.
 
 - <a href='http://nishio.github.io/fifth/?http://songle.jp/songs/www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv=51CH3dPaWXc'>Spitz's "Robinson"</a>
 - <a href='http://nishio.github.io/fifth/?http://songle.jp/songs/www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv=v2SlpjCz7uE'>'Star on Earth' by Miyuki Nakajima</a>.

 Robinson's chord movements are rather quiet. Fashion Monster, on the other hand, alternates between Gm Fm and Fm, and it's fun to watch them dance.
 
 
 Songle is a service that assists in understanding music, extracting information such as chord progressions from songs, visualizing them, and playing them back with emphasis on the chord progressions. For more information, please see the explanation on the Songle website. I tried to visualize it in the five-degree range, which I have been interested in for a long time, and it was very easy to realize it with less than 100 lines of source code. The source code for this demo is <a href='https://github.com/nishio/fifth'>https://github.com/nishio/fifth</a>.
 
 There is no manual or anything like that for my visualization of the five-degree circle, so I'll give a brief explanation:.
 - If you put the Songle URL after the ? After the URL, put the URL of Songle and the song will be visualized.
 - Outside is the fifth degree circle of a major chord, inside is the fifth degree circle of a minor chord
 - The red markers indicate the chord's constituent notes in the fifth degree range, but at this time they do not yet support sevens, etc., and are interpreted and displayed as major or minor three-note chords.
 
 
  The author is not sure how much error Songle's automatic chord recognition makes, so the songs with the most number of manual corrections are chosen above. If you find other songs that can be visualized in a good way, please let us know!
 
 PS
 - <a href-'http://nishio.github.io/fifth/?http://songle.jp/songs/www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv=fY1xN13G0pk'>"Saudade" by Porno Graffiti</a> sus4 and so on are all gung-ho. Currently it shows sus4 as the 5th degree circle of the major, but I wonder if it needs to be corrected, and how it should be corrected.
 - <a href='http://nishio.github.io/fifth/?http://songle.jp/songs/www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv=jcIOg_m-bp4'>"Invader Invader" by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. </a> The chord progression is docile compared to Fashion Monster, hovering in the 8:00-10:00 section, with the occasional different chord in between.
 - <a href='http://nishio.github.io/fifth/?http://songle.jp/songs/www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv=h6NCx0wcrC4'>Giant Steps by John Coltrane </a> This is apparently an interesting song that makes extensive use of transitions in the major third degree, and when viewed in the fifth degree circle, an equilateral triangle pattern appears. see <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B3%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%AC%E3% 83%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%83%81%E3%82%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8%E3%82%BA'>Cortoline Changes - Wikipedia</a>. Unfortunately, Songle's code recognition is failing over a wide range at this time. The triangle pattern in the beginning can be observed. Interesting. thanks id:ymotongpoo

By the way, I wonder if it is a misrecognition or a daring counter that sometimes the C# of 7 o'clock appears on the opposite side when the sound is around C and G.

 <body>I immediately followed it up with CAmiDion, a home-made instrument I have on hand. <br>http://www.yk.rim.or.jp/~kamide/music/chordhelper/hardware/<br>The chord buttons are lined up in the same order as the fifth degree circle, so not only the sound but even the movement of the chord buttons matched perfectly, which was quite fun. <br><br>By the way, there is also a Java application version of this http://www.yk.rim.or.jp/~kamide/music/chordhelper/. It would be interesting to try out the same "ensemble" together. <BR><BR>Another song that might be interesting to visualize is Let It Go, which we hear a lot these days. This song has many moments where it seems to casually go up an hour, or five degrees, and then casually go back down to the original key, which seems like a nice visualization. </body>

 <body>Kiyoshi, nice to meet you. <br>I heard about CAmiDion from Mr. INA of RakuChord and have been watching with interest. <br>I have added Let it go to my list. </body>
