 This is what I'm talking about! And the lyrics are good! I ran away from the moat - I was afraid of "entanglement"

 I miss playing as an archaeologist, whipping rosé (cows) with my initially equipped whip and saying "rosé is strong, it doesn't die at all" lol.
 
 (Explanation: whips have no effect on "hard-skinned monsters")
 
 I don't have a good image of Roze, Moumak, or Leochloretta because of the trauma from when they were mainly equipped with whips!

 The last box of beet tea purchased on 2009-02-17 is finally gone.

 It was about 800 yen for 36g at a nearby drugstore, so I bought it by mail order. I wonder how long pollen lasts. I ended up buying 8 of them, which would be free shipping. http://item.rakuten.co.jp/soukai/4960867708876/

 At the rate I boil 8 bags in 4 liters and drink it in a day or two (but not when my eyes don't itch), I give one box to someone, so that means I consumed 6 boxes in a year and a month. I think 8 boxes was a lot. However, I still buy 8 boxes because I have kept them vacuum-packed for a year with no harm done to them. Oh, I will buy 7 boxes because 7 boxes are free shipping.
