 Interesting game called divsum made by @tokoroten.

 Early stage: "What the heck is this? How do you play the game?" Middle game: "I see, you control the number of pieces by repeatedly shrinking and dispersing them to erase them" End game: "Oh no, you can't put them all in one place if they are so far apart! I got stuck once at the end of the game, and had to start over to clear the game in 26 moves. The shortest time I have so far is 19 moves, but there is a theory that it can be cleared in 15 moves.
 
 I made a problem that looked difficult because of the problem design function. 4 100s in a row, in a jumpy order. This problem was cleared in 106 moves. →The shortest time is currently 80 moves.

 Four 100s, lined up on the edge. This is cleared in 150 moves. →The shortest is 85 moves.

 Eight 100s are laid out on half the screen. This was cleared in 212 moves. →The shortest move is 143 moves.

 The one that I tried to make 1000 at once. 306 moves cleared. →The shortest was 181 moves.

 I was doing something like this when tokoroten asked me to make a tutorial.
 
 Q1: First of all, this can be solved in two moves. I didn't realize it until you showed me how to do it, but once I realized it, it was very important to shorten the number of moves.

 Q2: This can be solved in 4 moves; the trick used in the 2-move problem is not used this time. This is an example of how rushing to erase something when you can erase it can lead to a deadlock.

 Q3: Next, this can be solved in 5 moves. This one also does not use a backdoor trick. You need to sit back and read without clicking in a hurry.

 Q4: This can be solved in 9 moves. The previous problems were both even numbers, but this time they are odd numbers. No matter how hard we try, we cannot solve it in the same way as before. It is necessary to take a different route. (The shortest way is to solve it in 6 moves, and Q7 of the tutorial is to solve this in 6 moves.)

 Q5: A different kind of problem. This one can be solved in 15 moves, with 40 disappearing in the fourth move, but not making 40. I think that when starting from a situation with a lot of numbers, like the problem from 1000 above, it is necessary to keep reducing them like this. Then solve "how to collect the scattered objects"; in move 6, we get the same "odd pairs" as in Q4.

 Q6: This one goes through a slightly different path. 6 moves.

 Q7: Solve the problem in Q4 in 6 moves using the technique used in Q6. (thanks @Kei_Kei)

 This is not a tutorial problem. I wanted to try it; I solved it in 33 moves. I'm still not sure in what order to click in the early stages of the race against time. PS: I solved it in 18 moves.
