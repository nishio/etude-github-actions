empiricism
 Empiricism is the [philosophical] position that all human [knowledge] comes from [experience].
 John Locke's "[Tabula Rasa]" (Man is a blank slate at birth) is famous.

Nishio's Position
	Organisms have [innate] "advantageous characteristics" through [mutation] and [natural selection
  So "tabula rasa" is a [scientific] fallacy.
 On the other hand, it is not [useful] to think about the future [decisions] of one's individual already born, because innate characteristics are unchangeable.
 It is important to acquire knowledge from experience -> [how to learn].
