With moderation, it is not a fault, but an accomplishment. A grain of cheerfulness tones all tastes. Great men sometimes join in the fun and are thereby liked by all. But they should always maintain their dignity on such occasions and not go beyond the bounds of propriety. Some people also get out of difficulty most quickly by telling jokes. This is because there are times when you have to take yourself funny, even when others are being serious. You exhibit a sense of serenity, which acts as an attraction to all.
