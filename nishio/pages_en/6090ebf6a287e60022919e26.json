 There was no way to get lost! Although I still made a mistake and took the long way around.

 Oh, not next time, it's at the 5th Annual 1000 Speakers Conference in May. http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:5
 
 *1208562994* ATOK and zip code
 ATOK will even enter "Azumabashi, Sumida-ku, Tokyo" if I type "130-0001" and then "and" and use TAB to complete it. In fact, if I type "130-000" and complete, each of "130-000?" will be displayed with the address.

 *1208599734*XPathGraph
 I had completely forgotten about it, but they were still making graphs during that time.
 - <a href="http://xpath.kayac.com/graph/CCtjpMgJ3RGZVg">Yasukazu Nishio's Hatena Diary : XPathGraph</a>
 -- This is the number of characters on the top page, so it's the total for the last 5 days, so it's reasonable.
 - <a href="http://xpath.kayac.com/graph/wAjHX80J3RG0PA">Yasukazu Nishio's Ego Search : XPathGraph</a>
 -- Surprisingly, the number has increased and decreased.
 - <a href="http://xpath.kayac.com/graph/lDNkZ88J3RGj6w">Number of unread LDRs by Yasukazu Nishio : XPathGraph</a>
 -- Steadily piling up
 
 I wonder if another week or two will make it more interesting?

 I almost blew tea lol.
 
 On the other hand, in Japan, which has a reputation for intensive agriculture on small plots of land, the method of growing vegetables inside buildings has long ago become profitable, and the leafy vegetables in Tokyo Disneyland's cuisine are supposed to be supplied stably from the company's own factories, not from the market.

 I'm leaving it until it cools down now.
 
 *1208623340* I'm not good at Kotonoha.
 -Kotonoha - HN like real name: http://kotonoha.cc/no/84988/2
 
 It's "On the pros and cons of HNs that sound like real names. Yes or No?" Or is it "Is it a real name-like HN? Yes/No?" In the first place, there seem to be many people who interpret "a real name-like HN" as "a HN derived from a real name. Is "Murata" a real name-derived HN, but "Isoriko" is not a real name-derived HN? I feel uncomfortable with "Nice to meet you, I'm Isiori Murata". Nice to meet you, I am <a href="http://iddy.jp/profile/ykzts/">Kazutoshi Yamagishi</a>" sounds like my real name. It sounds so real that some people might suspect that it is actually his real name, even though he claims it is a pseudonym. Nice to meet you, I'm Yasukazu Nishio" also sounds like a real name. Or rather, it is my real name! Is a real name included in a real name-like HN, or is a HN a concept that includes a real name? If "real name-like HN" means "HN derived from real name," then "real name-like pseudonym" is x because it is not derived from real name, but if "looks like real name" is the issue, then it is x. If the point is that "a real name that looks like a real name" is also "a real name that looks like a real name," then the answer is "X," but if the point is that "a real name that looks like a real name" is not derived from a real name, then the answer is "X," right?
 
 
 What a thing to think about.
 
 By the way, the reason why I came to Kotonoha is because I wondered if there is a pseudonym generator that looks like a real name. It seems that there is not.

 I guess you are not supposed to eat shrimp. It is a horrible thing to boil a creature like a shrimp, which has many legs like an insect, and eat it while plucking off its legs and head! I wonder if they think it's a horror to boil them and eat them while plucking their legs and heads.
 
 And if you look closely, do grasshoppers eat them?
