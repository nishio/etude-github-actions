 Around 10:00, go to bed sleepy-headed → wake up at 5:30
 
 I woke up feeling fully charged for the first time in a long time and wanted to go back to sleep but couldn't because I couldn't sleep.
 I can't use the vacuum cleaner or washing machine due to the time of day, but I'll just get ready...

 I found out about this event from amachang's blog and came hoping to meet you.
 
 Many people said. #1981@freenode when I invited them to come because amachang is there,
 
 I'm at Cybozu Labs. I stayed at a comic café last night and didn't take a bath, so I can't stay here because my body smells bad.
 
 He said. "Wait, you're so concerned about your body odor, you want to act so hot?

 13:47 (nishio) Are the logs recorded manually?
 13:47 (woremacx) I'm logging everything on tiarra
 13:47 (woremacx) irc proxy
 13:47 (nishio) Hmmm...
 13:48 (woremacx) http://www.clovery.jp/tiarra/
 13:48 (nishio) I wonder if tiarra makes it easy to create IRC bots
 13:48 (woremacx) OppaiSan seems to be ruby
 (omitted)
 15:36 (nishio) Is irc a "send a private message to a channel and it will be delivered to everyone who joins the channel" system?
 15:36 (nishio) I was wondering why there is privmsg but not pubmsg
 15:43 (nishio) I mean, with LimeChat, can I see the "protocol log"?
 (omitted)
 16:17 *__81kun join #1981 (n=__81kun@203.112.24.226)
 16:18 (__81kun) Hello hello hello!
 16:18 (OppaiSan) Hello! Hello!
 16:18 (__81kun) I can finally speak!
 16:18 (OppaiSan) ！！！
 16:18 (tokuhirom) Uhi
 16:19 (__81kun) I'm still just ventriloquizing on privmsg!
 16:19 (takesako) ktkr
 16:19 (__81kun) Try saying "say hello!" to me!
 16:19 (OppaiSan) In your face?
 16:19 (tokuhirom) say manko!
 16:19 (__81kun) manko!
 16:20 (tokuhirom) _81kun is vulgar.
 16:20 (OppaiSan) How is that _81kun is a certified vulgarity committee?
 16:20 (__81kun) What are you saying all of a sudden? ＞＜I'm not a fan of that.
 16:20 (OppaiSan) （＞＜）
 16:20 (__81kun) I don't think it should be naughty!
 16:20 (OppaiSan) ！！！
 16:22 (nishio) Someone should try to get __81kun to say say in a private message~!
 16:22 (takesako) _81kun's first words of ego?
 16:23 (__81kun) I don't think it should be naughty!

 therefore
 -Python IRC library
 --http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/
 I was able to create a bot in a little over two hours, even though I don't understand IRC protocols at all.
 The code is about 50 lines in total, and it took me quite a bit of time to understand IRC. Also, I had to pass the various restrictions that freenode has in place to prevent spam, which was a pain.
 Here is the code: http://coderepos.org/share/browser/lang/python/81kun
 
 -----
 Postscript.
 
 I wish I could go back to junior high school with the technology I have now. I wouldn't be writing weird proprietary scripts in VisualBasic. I wouldn't make a debugger to debug a strange scripting language.

 But now, I can no longer buy a book of world famous quotes and type it in, or type in the lyrics of ani-songs, believing that an intellectual body is born from such things, as if I should only have a solid knowledge. For better or worse, maybe I was able to make this album because I was a "chuuni-sick" person.

 01:27 (Yappo_) Going to OtohaChan and 81kung's wedding
 01:27 (OtohaChan) Hot Hot Hot
 01:27 (OtohaChan) OtohaChan and I are both going to the wedding of my 81st birthday boy!
 01:28 (Yappo_) OtohaChan is self chaotic w
 01:28 (OtohaChan) Hot Hot Hot
 01:28 (yusukebe) ｗｗｗ
 01:28 (nishio_) I hate OtohaChan because he is stupid by 81kun
 01:28 (itkz) It's so bad it's funny just watching it.
 01:28 (OppaiSan) Not as bad as your face
 01:28 (itkz) Shut up.

 Interesting.
 It's good that it's interesting, but it's not #1981 as it should be. IRC is probably the easiest place for people without Hatena accounts & mixi accounts to enter, but I think it's a bad thing to be in this situation.

 I think I'll move the bot here.
