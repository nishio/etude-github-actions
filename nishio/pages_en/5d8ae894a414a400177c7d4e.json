Automatic mask tracking
[Premiere Pro] can analyze the video and apply a mask with automatic target tracking.
In other words, if you need to blur a person's face, you can use a mask to specify the area to be hidden.
Even if the position of the person's face changes in the video, it is automatically tracked and blurred.

The icon that looks like a play button next to "Mask Path" is the button to track.
