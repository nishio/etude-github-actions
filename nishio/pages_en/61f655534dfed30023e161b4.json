Don't keep making jokes.
Wisdom is demonstrated in serious matters and is valued more highly than mere wit. A person who jokes all the time cannot tackle serious problems. Others will not entrust a serious problem to a person who is always joking.

One who always jokes is like a liar. For others think of a liar as "this person lies," and of one who always tells jokes as "this person always tells jokes.

Wisdom is demonstrated in serious matters and is valued more highly than mere wit. He who always jokes will never be able to deal with serious matters. One is like a liar in that one believes neither, always expecting a lie on the one hand and a joke on the other. One does not know when one is speaking judiciously, but that is the same as doing nothing. Continually telling jokes can quickly become disheartening. Many people gain a reputation for being witty, but they lose credibility as sensible people because of it. There is a small time for jokes, and all the rest of the time should be serious.
