 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/camlspotter/20101212/1292165692'>An OCaml user with 15 years of experience tried Haskell at work for 6 months - Oh, you `re no (fun _ â†’ more)</a>. There's a great entry here, but I'll quote a few official sentences since some people might read it and say "Yeah, Haskell and *Python's* offside rules aren't good".

     Simple is better than complex.
     Complex is better than complicated.
     Flat is better than nested.
     Sparse is better than dense.

 It's just that the kitchen sink programmers who write Haskell code with 500 characters per line and think "I'm cool to write code like this" are the shit, and decent people discipline themselves to write decent code.
 
 
 As for the percentage of Haskell users with kitchen sickness, there are no reliable epidemiological studies, so I won't mention it. Also, this is a story! Don't hit me! (Oh!

 <body>I wouldn't bother writing if it was kitchen code. What, that person? level. <br>And I don't think it would be that long for python because Haskell and python have different language paradigms. </body>
