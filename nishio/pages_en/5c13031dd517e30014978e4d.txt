Large subject matter saves thought.
>"I don't particularly want to argue that [the subject matter is large], but it's easy to talk about it in a messy [generalized] way, so I'd like to promote the "subject matter is large as a result" theory.
>"It is not my intention to make the subject matter larger, but simply because I have a small sample size due to my [small world], and the subject matter is larger as a result because I constructed my argument within that small sample size" theory.
> As a thinking game, so when you see a "claim with a large subject", it would be interesting to think "how small can that subject be?
> The assertion "[I am a 00]" is also a major subject in some cases. There may be additional conditions, such as time constraints.
>We need to be especially careful when our minds are tired. The judgment, "I'm already a 00," is an [overgeneralization] and likely to be a "[big subject]." Because when the mind is tired, the vision becomes narrower and the world becomes smaller.

[Clarifying [boundary conditions] requires [thinking]. When that [thinking cost] cannot be generated, omitting the boundary conditions results in a larger set.

	[When the mind is tired, the vision becomes narrower, the world becomes smaller].
	[narrow view]
	[Bigger subject] is [thought saving].
