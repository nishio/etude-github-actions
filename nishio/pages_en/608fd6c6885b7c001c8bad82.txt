The factorial of 10 is 4 million at the highest, so the entire search can be solved with plenty of time to spare.
code:python
 from itertools import permutations
 for xs in permutations(range(10), 10):
     a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j = xs
     if a == 0 or c == 0 or f == 0:
         continue
     if (
         a * 1000 + b * 100 + a * 10 + b +
         c * 100 + d * 10 + e ==
         f * 10000 + g * 1000 + h * 100 + i * 10 + j
     ):
         print(xs)
code:output
 (9, 3, 8, 6, 4, 1, 0, 2, 5, 7)
