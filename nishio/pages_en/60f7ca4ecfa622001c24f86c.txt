>I can't tell you what to do, but if I may offer a fluffy opinion, I would recommend the practice of "weakening your own voice a bit and accepting the voices of others with an open mind". (continued)
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280461707236659207]: you seem to have a good enough grasp of your situation. I think you are sensing that something bad may happen.
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280462220694966272]: To accept others' evaluations honestly does not mean to try to match them. I think it is a good idea to accept it as it is.
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280462609238507521]: that is only his/her evaluation, and if you have not reached that point, it is not your fault, and there is no There is no logic why you have to get there.
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280463370668224512]: It was also hard to understand how you could weaken your own voice a bit, but it means to go in a different direction (trial and error). Your inner voice may say, for example, "I have received such an undeserved reputation! If I keep going in this direction, I will become a liar! I desperately need to close the gap!" You have to desperately close the gap!
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280463797996539905]: "No, no, no, don't be so hasty. If you get crushed, there is nothing to evaluate. Let's go steadily at our own pace," I try to push back my "voice.
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280464386730024962]: what is important in such a situation is another person to whom you can talk about many things. Someone who is willing to listen to your stories like the one you wrote to me in a chatty way. Someone who will listen to you without saying this or that. It would be nice to have such a mature person by my side.
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280465010821480448]: If you are a student in your late teens, and you are appreciated by those around you, I think that you are usually considered to be a good student in your own right. Therefore, I hope that you will not wear away your possessions with unnecessary hard work or dark efforts. Treat yourself with care and nurture yourself gently and greatly.
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280465374148870144]: trying to live up to the over-esteem you have received is fine if well controlled. The problem is that there can be a sense of sadness mixed in, or a lack of a broader perspective.
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280465821874057216]: the recognition given to you will come from your immediate surroundings for now. The world is much bigger and full of unimaginable variety. You are going out into such a world, so treat yourself carefully and nurture yourself slowly.
	>[hyuki https://twitter.com/hyuki/status/1280465902987644929]: that's what I thought. Thanks for your question.
