 I encountered a situation where I had to rewrite the following sentences into bullet points, how would you guys break it up?
  >There are two approaches to A: "List all Bs and evaluate them one by one" and "Make one B, examine it, and if not satisfied, make the next B and repeat the examination.
  >The former is desirable because if A is simple and B can be enumerated, then B can be considered without omission.
  >However, in most cases, A is complex and B is so large that it would take a great deal of effort just to consider each one, let alone enumerate them, so the latter is realistic and reasonable.

The task of "neatly itemize this" was the kind of task that I wanted to do in [Kozaneba] because it was too much of a cognitive burden for me to do on Scrapbox.

 There are two approaches to A
 　prior full enumeration approach
 　　List all B's and evaluate them one by one.
 　sequential review approach
 　　Make one B, study it, and if not satisfied, make the next B and repeat the study.

	Sequential review approach is appropriate in most cases
  Because B is so huge and difficult to enumerate in most cases.
		However, if A is simple and B can be enumerated, the pre-enumeration approach is preferred in that B can be considered without omission

　I dare you to leave the garbage that is often deleted to precipitate it down.
　　I see the whole "A is simple" and "A is complex" thing falling through.
　　　It was determined that I didn't say anything important to the argument.
　　　If you know what keywords A and B are, you could decide that you'd rather supplement A.
　　　The mere status quo of A makes it look like they're not doing any work.
