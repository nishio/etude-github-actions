Write your intentions in coded text.

Write your intention in cypher.
xcviii 

Emotions are the gates of the soul. The most practical knowledge lies in faking them. Those who play with their cards exposed risk losing their wager. Cautiousness should combat the curiosity of the inquirer: adopt the policy of the squid. Do not let others know your preferences, lest they use them against you or take advantage of you with flattery.
