Creating a candidate set of key phrases
In [keyphrase extraction], the problem is how to create candidates.
　[RAKE] chops the stop word as a delimiter.
　[TextRank] first filters out all but nouns and adjectives
　[Phrase-based TF-IDF] uses only the longest noun phrase
　All substrings are candidates.
　[Development of a system for extracting keywords in unexplored text information].
　I want to include strings enclosed in parentheses as keyword candidates.

　When trying to find key phrases with an approach that calculates scores for the candidates and takes the big ones
　　[EmbedRank] uses similarity to the original document, so the text itself must not be included in the candidates.
