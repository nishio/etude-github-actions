The greatest obstacle to learning is teaching the answer.
"Isn't [teaching the answer] the biggest obstacle to [learning]? Because it permanently takes away the opportunity to [find the answer] on one's own. I believe that the only way for people to learn is to think logically and find [the answer] for themselves. In order to get people to think, the imperative "! mark in the imperative form is much better than the question mark "? mark is much better" ([Eliyahu Goldratt]).
