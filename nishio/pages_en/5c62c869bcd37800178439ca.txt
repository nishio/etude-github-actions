I'll do two, one pomo at a time.
I said, "Which do you think I should do first, the manuscript due on Thursday or the presentation material due on Friday morning at 10:00 a.m.?"
Wife: "I think we should do both one [pomodoro] at a time to gather information to help us decide which one to do."

	I'm wasting my time thinking about which one to choose.

 Once I had done one pomodoro of the manuscript, I was able to estimate that I would finish it with one or two pomodoro left, so I got motivated and just finished it.
 In retrospect, the phenomenon of "the scale of the task is not estimated
 [work excited].

Wife: "If the purpose is to estimate, I personally feel that doing two pomodoros each would lose less than an hour, which is too big. 15 minutes or so would be better."
 If you feel it's too big and don't want to start, make it smaller.
 Maybe we could make it a pomodoro where we do two 10-minute sessions each.
 It's also possible to think of "estimating" as a separate thing, since it's harmful if it generates the assumption that "we have to work in units of one pomodoro."
