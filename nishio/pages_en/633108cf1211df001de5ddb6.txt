The economist Schumpeter defines innovation as "[a] new combination. Double business is exactly what creates that new union. [Innovation is the ability to pull something from the outside world and combine it with something that does not exist within the company. Given that, I only wish that everyone would do double jobs in worlds I don't know about and accelerate innovation ([Aono http://mydeskteam.com/casefile/1887/]).
