The Curse of Letterpress
2018-09-10
	In the days when people drew by hand, there was no significant cost difference between letters and diagrams.
	At one point in human history, only letters could be reproduced at low cost ([letterpress]).
 As a result, letters were used exclusively for [knowledge representation] and distribution
 Surrounded by [books] written in letters, learning from textbooks written in letters, and expressing and presenting the results in letters.
 As a result, the effects of the temporarily low cost of letter distribution are still being felt
 Stuck in [the belief that they must be expressed in writing].
	Looking back on this era from the future, it appears to be a time cursed with letterpress printing.
