Sending messages to individual sprites in Scratch
One-line summary:.
 The binary display could be created by "giving each sprite a different ID, sending a message to each sprite to set an individual value, sending the value to all the sprites, and each sprite reacting based on its own value.

 Scratch does not have classes, but it does have instances in the form of sprites, which can be cloned.
 There is an event handler that is called when cloned, so the equivalent of a constructor argument can be read from the global here.
	Although sprites are not first-class objects, they can point to a specific instance by creating a unique ID using a global variable.
	Messages are broadcast, but if you put a global destination variable and only sprites that match your ID respond to it, you can do the same thing as a destination-specified message.
	(I misunderstood when I saw that only one lamp was lit.) The message, if one is received and processed, is not conveyed to the others... I thought it would be conveyed to all of them...
		Oh, no, this is different, because the division is not integer division, so you need ROUND.

	It's done.
