It's hard to verbalize what you don't understand.
It would be good to add this in the free text field as a comment from the instructor:.

It is difficult to verbalize what we do not know. What is not understood is not clearly seen. It is absurd to try to explain it in neat and tidy words.

It is important to write it down first, even if it is just a list of fragmentary keywords. There is no need to try to make it into a sentence, no need to use "ishasu" or "ishimasu".

Nishio is not an esper and cannot read what is in your mind. If you want to increase the probability that your questions will be answered, you need to pull out as many words as possible from your mind and write them down here; otherwise, you will not be able to get the answers you need.
