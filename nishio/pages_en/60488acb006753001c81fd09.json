Priority notice brings hell
A system that prioritizes actions from friends over those from non-friends.
It is [a road to hell paved with good intentions], even though it may have been designed that way with good intentions.

This can lead to an efficient division of opinion based on the original friendship relationship.
For a good discussion, it is important to be able to observe the diversity of opinions. Humans have a bug that causes them to assume that their own opinions are universal, and seeing and hearing different opinions and modifying them leads to good discussions.
However, if the priority of notifications is changed according to fixed friend relationships, the response of friends who have a high probability of being of the same opinion will be seen more often, reinforcing the misconception that their opinions are universal.
