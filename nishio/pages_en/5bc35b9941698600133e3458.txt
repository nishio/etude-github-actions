[Blue Ocean Strategy] p.37

I've heard some concerns about the term "[blue ocean]" being used in a crude way, as if it were "something new with no competition," so I thought I'd pick up on the material since I'll probably write or speak about it eventually.

Value Innovation is the foundation of the Blue Ocean Strategy, which simultaneously [reduces costs] and [differentiates].
Reduce costs by reducing or eliminating features that are taken for granted in existing products, and instead increase or add features that are not yet taken for granted.

See [Strategy Canvas] as a basic premise for this.
