Dominion 1 month review
2/17 Played the Steam version and enjoyed it.
	Tried to do it with the standard pack first before buying the expansion pack, and as a result, the computer beat me to tears.
　I bought all kinds of expansions because I didn't understand them after reading all the explanations (see below).
	It would be nice to have a rematch with the same kingdom card (like do it till you win).
		But now that I know there are so many cards and mechanisms I didn't know about, maybe I should try different kingdom cards.
		When I grew the "Growing Traveler" to Champion, all the action cards were +1 action, which freaked me out.

2/18
	I was wondering if there was any way to know which expansion the card came from, but it turns out that it's identified by the icon in the corner of the card.
		I made a table of correspondence between marks and extended names.


European magpie (Pica pica)
The data is publicly available, and after analyzing it, the Magpie is the fourth strongest.
The top two were growing travelers, but third place was a surprise.

	I want to install a correspondence chart in my brain where I can look at the name of a card and know which expansion it's in and what its English name is...
 I thought about making the same supply on hand to play while I watched the game, but gave up when I was looking for the card.

	The Problem of Predestination
		[https://gyazo.com/bc720975d14bdcce4f475d2eedb4b44a]
		I made the same deck and played 4 players with Hard AI and for some reason no one used the curse...
	 Basically, it seems that having colonies slows down the end of the game and favors combo and compression. On the other hand, yesterday's supply seemed to be a bad supply, with no decent draw or compression, making it unsuitable for combo or compression, and further diluting the deck through curse spreading.

	High Score Challenge
	　Medium Current top score of 257 in 4-player match
	　Teacher + Garden + Mountain Guard

	The villa is amazing.
		After running out of actions and entering the purchase phase, you can buy a villa for 4 gold and have another action phase for practically +2 actions + 1 coin. You can use the storeroom after paying the treasure.
	I'd like to do something about the fact that with all the different cards, it's hard to tell what's a draw and what's a positive action in a flash.
		I wasn't aware that Wild Hunt was "victory points + blacksmithing".
	The noisy village + 3 action is awesome too.
	When you use two idols, do you get a blessing with the first and cast a curse with the second?

	The theory that the castle was a no-brainer but surprisingly interesting.
	It would be exhilarating to have a gradually increasing price deck and buy a royal castle for 10 gold, if there were no curses or other obstacles, if there were no curses.

3/7
	I had my first rating match against people from around the world at Dominion Online.

3/12
	I also bought a Dominion Online subscrip...
 This card is in Japanese.

	I didn't understand what you meant by preview, but you mean the official commentary.
		I've read translations of it and understand the thread of the mountain that divides it into four parts.

		The third card deals a curse if you guess the top of the deck, but if you think you can't guess that, the fourth card has the ability to stack on the top of the deck, so if you combine them, you can definitely deal a curse.
		The card that gives you a second turn with only three cards in play was also not clear on its own, but when combined with the next card, which "can gain any action card not on the field", it is strong, and the next card is an action card with a victory point!
