The flow of birth of fireworks to think about

Individual Explanation
　1 First, Jiro Kawakita, a cultural anthropologist, had so much data collected during his fieldwork that he was wondering how to organize it.

　2 The KJ method was created to solve that problem.

　　An important element is "bundling with a faceplate."
　　　This reduced the apparent number of sheets, which solved the problem of "too much data and not knowing how to put it all together.
　3 In brainstorming, when trying to keep a thorough record, the conversation is interrupted, and even if a one-dimensional record is kept, the whole picture cannot be grasped and only the most recent comments are affected.
　4 So we took only the spatial arrangement part of the KJ method and applied it ([Pulse Discussion]).
　　[https://gyazo.com/45913846f6fd8dff2a0ccb90fa38556f]
　　At this time, "spatial arrangement without bundling" was born.
　5 In the process of teaching the KJ method, Jiro Kawakita realized that many people do not do the interview part well in the first place, and this is where improvement is needed.

　6 "[Exploratory net]" was created by applying the "spatial arrangement without bundling" that was born from the pulse discussion.

　　So we thought that by frequently spatializing the interview notes, it would be better than accumulating them over a long period of time and then doing the KJ method at the end.
　7 More value than expected was discovered in the exploratory net. Jiro Kawakita came to believe that the value was more important in the effect it had on later coverage than in the effect of summarizing earlier coverage

　　Jiro Kawakita calls this value "divergent thinking.
　　 Nishio's opinion: This term is abstract and loses [the scent of the soil]. It is important to look at the muddy "how it developed through trial and error. That is why I wrote this page.
　8 If there is value in doing this before the interview, you should also do it at the beginning of the interview where there is no interview data yet. So we can have a variant of the exploratory net that says, "I'm going to do an [internal exploration] of my mind with the theme in the middle, and then sequentially put down what I find."

　9 Birth of the word "fireworks
　　Seeing this characteristic of "spreading out in all directions from the central theme," Jiro Kawakita begins to say, "This is 'fireworks.

　10 Exploration nets become known as fireworks
　　[https://gyazo.com/77425150a1f8357e4396a9dc10bb08e7]
　　Nishio's opinion: in retrospect, here's the seed of confusion
　　It would be clearer in structure to call the "theme-centered variants of expedition nets" "fireworks," but the historical fact is that expedition nets as a whole have come to be called "fireworks.
　　After the fact, the "theme-centered exploratory net variants" were called "exploratory fireworks," and the original exploratory nets that were intended to "summarize" were called "integrated fireworks.
　　In 1986, in "KJ-hoho Chochu wo Shitayaku wo Makuete" he wrote that "exploratory fireworks are the prototype of exploratory nets" (p.300), but he did not introduce the method of writing themes in the middle at the time exploratory nets were introduced in "[Exploratory Studies of Knowledge]" in 1977.
　　　I think it was done as needed without clear language and was not separated as a method in the early days.
　　　　I'm a little fuzzy on the back and forth in this area because I don't have enough data.
　　　The difference between the two methods is whether or not you think the data has been gathered sufficiently for the theme. Integrated fireworks are used when data is available, while exploratory fireworks are used when materials have not been gathered (p.300-302).
　　　In the diagram, the exploratory fireworks are drawn as if they were only at the beginning, but in a situation where "I've done some interviews and collected some data, but I feel it's not enough for the theme," I would probably do exploratory fireworks again, even in the middle of the interview.
　11 Birth of Thinking Fireworks
　　[https://gyazo.com/269a7177b9db7ca47e7128d893ceb889]
　　Exploratory fireworks can be executed without interview data, which means they should be usable even when separated from the purpose of "doing interviews" in the first place.
　　So "Thinking Fireworks" was born in the form of applying it to the everyday purpose of "having something to think about".
