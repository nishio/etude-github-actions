Between Tweet and long text
[https://gyazo.com/2b726ba195e580ef9a27cdb151fedd06]
	Many people are able to [Tweet] what comes to mind without [psychological barrier].
		Tweeting is also [an output].
		Create [opportunities to get feedback
		But Tweet is not a very useful accumulation in the long run.
	It costs a lot to [clean up] [an idea] and turn it into a blog post.
		It's like, "I left it in [draft] status.
		The more [neglect], the more [enthusiasm] goes down.
		Writing out of a sense of [obligation] that it would be a waste if you don't complete it is damaging to your mental health.
		Create negative feelings about writing
	You can tweet to [Scrapbox] as a better form than Tweeting.
		I chatted with [Tomoya Tachikawa] the other day.
			I'm left thinking and not writing -> it disappears.
 	 Written but not connected -> not recalled
 	 Tied together -> Ties gradually increase because either one of them is recalled at the same time that the other is recalled.
 	In the long run, the network becomes progressively denser.
