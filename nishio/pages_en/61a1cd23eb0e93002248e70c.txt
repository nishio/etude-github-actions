After reading [I Ching (Iwanami Bunko)] and [Daily I Ching], I thought that the reason why the I Ching itself does not make sense when I read it is because it is already an illustrated book of abstracted [metaphors].
	[Books are already a product of abstraction.]
	[formal knowledge and rootless knowledge].

If you read only metaphor X, it is only a fragmented landscape. It is only when you combine it with your own situation, etc., in the form of "your situation is something like X," that meaning emerges. It's imagining meaning through metaphor collation.
 [Eugene Gendlin's Metaphor Concept]

I've noticed that, so let's try to map this situation to a metaphor.
No sticks or dice, so I'll do it in Python.

　　Oh, it's like they're endorsing this, saying, "This is the way to do it.
　　The message is that it is important not to be too proud to avoid being bitten by a tiger.
　　You can do what you want, but it's dangerous to claim to know what you don't know.
　　In the first place, the ghosts are just living the way they want to live, and they say to others, "This way of life is right! I know a better way to live! I know a better way to live!
　　　It's like the difference between "people who practice careful living alone" and "people who appeal to me, saying, 'I'm living a careful life, isn't it great, don't you admire me?

For walking a lot in Pikmin Bloom these days.

 There's no sign of metaphor, is there?
 So, on the other hand, what would happen if we didn't do Pikmin Bloom?

		Metaphors that are at odds with each other in the organization but happen to meet people who understand each other in the street, not in official places.
		Oh yeah, I happened to find a nice hanging playground the other day.
		That place closes at 5pm, but it's 4pm! I'll go there anyway, I want to use the Pikmin Bloom detector.

Thoughts so far
　The metaphor of "if you get carried away and walk around without looking properly, you will step on the tiger's tail and get bitten" is very vivid and good.
　On the other hand, "Fire Heavenly Greatly" or "Super nice!" is the only thing it says, so I don't have enough material to expand on the image. I guess this means I need to read more related literature to get more material to expand on.
　　I read a little more around the area and found that the interpretation was that "big possession" was a great possession, and the image of a cart with a big load on it.
　　You loaded the cart with something of value, so it's a "go!"
　　The baggage of value here is pikmin blooms.

　The sunset was beautiful, the tea was roasting and smelled good, and I was playing the shamisen.
　　And cold, and stimulating to the senses...

　In retrospect, the "state of antagonism within the organization" was probably the antagonism between the feeling of being comfortable with physical exercise and the feeling of being a pain in the ass and not wanting to go outside because of the virus.
　　The "great possession" of pikmin blooms has made them go outside, and this is a good thing, so keep going.
　　On the other hand, what if I hadn't done the Pikmin Bloom, I "happened to find" the hanging playground equipment during the second round of vaccinations, so that might have been an incentive to get out of the house, because even today's behavior is mainly hanging and the Pikmin is secondary.

Q: Is it okay to continue with the way things are going with Mycra?

		>The gen. body. No iniquity.
　　Remain in their bodies, blameless.
　　[The Daily I Ching] explains, "You cannot hold others, but you alone can hold fast."
　Hmmm, so you're saying that you have no problem staying here and continuing to do this on your own, but don't expect others to stay as well?
　Q: Is that the correct interpretation?

　I see - I mean, "Can we continue to go on like we are about the mikura?" The question was ambiguous. There are two elements to the mikura
　　1: Resource packs are being built.
　　2: Create a place for others to operate as an experiment in creating a forum for online collaboration.
　　There are two
　　1 continues unremarkably, but 2 didn't get as many people as expected at the Cybozu Hackathon.
　　We tried to expand the unexplored junior server to the unexplored main body, but it was like "some new people came" and I don't feel like we ignited it.
　　This 2 "feeling of not getting my way" produced a feeling of "can I keep going?" was giving birth to the feeling of "Can I continue?
　　In conclusion, the second thing is that at this stage, "I can stay, but I can't make others stay," so don't worry too much about it and just do the first thing without hesitation.
　　By doing one, you increase your "reserves", and after your reserves have increased, you can "cross the river", and so on.
　　What exactly "crossing the river" is, I can't see at this point, but we'll know when we get to the banks of the river, and for now we can build up our reserves for crossing the river.
