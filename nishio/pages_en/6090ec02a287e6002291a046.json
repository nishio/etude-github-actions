 The one I applied for was this one, which I have blogged about before:

 I am not sure why it appears to rotate, but it is strange that it stops rotating when the spatial frequency changes by getting too close or too far away.
 
 What surprised me when I saw other works at the exhibition was that many of them moved. It also seemed to be important to give explanations. I was given a special award, although I was not selected because of this problem, because I just sent a still image without thinking. You can see other winning works in the results page:<a href='http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/sakkon/sakkon2009.html'>Illusion Contest 2009</a>. I don't think my name is on the page because it is a special award.
 
 *1260272490*Diary of Discard
 - That's the first cell phone I ever used! I miss it! You don't need this one, let's get rid of it.
 - The foot pedal switch I bought to make a foot shift key...hmmm. Put it in the hold box for now.
 - How about putting the contents of the retention box in a bazaar or something once and throwing it away if no one takes it back?
 - Sunglasses with lenses removed. I don't want them. Why did I keep them? Oh, I was going to put a USB camera on them and do blink counting and stuff. If I ever need them, I can buy them at a 100 yen store. Throw them away, throw them away, throw them away.
 - Old sun visor with a broken brow. I don't need it anymore because I bought a new one.
 - I guess I should admit my mistake and throw away the kena ...... I bought on a whim when I was in high school or so. For now, it's going to the hold box.
 - Label printer. But only the main unit with no cable or CD set. Where did the rest go?
 - A one ear + microphone intercom that came with the voice recognition software. Not used at all. Should I throw it away...hmmm, to the hold box.
 - I bought this pen tablet a long time ago. Yeah, I think the company that made it went bankrupt and the drivers were unavailable. If I need a tablet, I can just buy a new one. I'm sure the performance has improved a lot. I'll throw it away.
 - Nagano Tektron's "Favorite Keyboard", the kind with 30 keys, each with a corresponding shortcut key. It's dirty. Let's put it in the hold box for now.
 - While I was cleaning up, I unearthed eight washcloths.
 - Pocket tissues are zapped. You don't need more than a certain amount.
 - I always use the AC adapter of my MacBook with the longer cable because I don't like how hard it is to plug in, but what should I do with the shorter cable? I'm pretty sure I won't use it. And even if I needed it, I probably wouldn't be able to get it out. I wonder if I should throw it away.
 - A map of Tokyo. I used to carry it around in my bag, but I'll just use my iPhone now. Let's throw it away.
 - An old bag. The zipper was broken and the bag was falling apart, but I didn't have a bag that could hold a lot of things, so I kept using it. I bought an ortlieb bag, so I don't need this one anymore. Let's throw it away.
