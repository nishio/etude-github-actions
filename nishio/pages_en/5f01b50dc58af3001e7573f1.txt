Negative criticism is easy
[Criticism is a refuge for the mediocre.]
>Negative criticism is easy because it is always possible to find fault with anything if one looks hard enough. It is quite easy to concentrate on the faults and ignore what is worthwhile. But the main attraction of criticism is that is at once makes the critic superior to what he is criticizing. Because criticism is so easy it is often the refuge of mediocre minds who cannot be interesting in any other way.
