 It's a good entry, but I had one point of concern.
 
 >>
 Perhaps it is the IT industry that is destined to always be learning new things in some form or another.
 <<
 
 I know this is a common phrase, but I thought it would be a waste if someone reads it and misunderstands, "Well, the IT industry sounds like a lot of work, so I'm not going to work in it. Today, I would like to write about that.
 
 First, let's review what capitalism was all about. For example, yarn spinning was initially done at home by spinning a small spinning wheel. However, with the advancement of technology, "machines that could spin yarn more efficiently" were invented. Using that machine became more productive than using a human-powered spinning wheel to make yarn at home. But the machine was expensive and not everyone could afford it. So the rich (capitalists) bought the machines and the workers went to the machines to work. Even if the capitalist took some money for the use of the machine, it was still more productive and more profitable than using a human-powered spinning wheel at home.
 
 In summary, capitalist society arose in a situation where "<span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">investing the resource of capital in the productive apparatus improves returns</span>.
 
 Let's say you are writing something in JavaScript for a website. Even if the performance of the computer used is the same, it is clear that differences in knowledge will make a difference in productivity and the quality of the finished product. (How many people who would say, "Oh, who's Jake Ellie?" ) In other words, this is a situation where <span class="deco" style="font-weight:bold;">investing resources such as time in productive knowledge can improve returns</span>. In these situations, it is more advantageous to invest in knowledge, which is what tends to happen in the IT industry, which is why people say, "Perhaps the IT industry is destined to always be learning new things in one way or another." So it is said, "Perhaps the IT industry is destined to always learn something new.
 
 However, the important question is not whether you are in the IT industry, but whether the investment in knowledge will yield a return. For example, a person whose job is to scan books in Google is an employee of an IT company, but the investment in knowledge will probably not lead to a return. On the other hand, a writer who writes manuscripts for magazines is not considered to be in the IT industry, but his knowledge of editors and version control systems may increase his productivity. Also, investment in information-gathering skills could lead to productivity gains in quite a few industries.
 
 Regardless of the industry, if the situation can be established that "investing time resources in productive knowledge improves returns," then we are destined to always be learning something new in some form or another. This is the time we live in.

 â†‘upI learned this knowledge from this book.
 
 PS
 >>
 @ymotongpoo You can survive in the IT industry without studying, and you need to study in other industries. It's just a matter of whether or not you're going to be "dekiru" in that industry.

 Indeed. I made a mistake when I said "destined to learn" or "should learn." In a situation where learning brings about increased returns, relative to those who don't learn versus those who do, those who don't learn will be less productive, have lower social reputation, and lower wages and benefits. I should have said that this is an inevitable fate. There is freedom not to learn even in such a social situation. Just as there were people who resisted it during the industrial revolution and mechanization. <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%83%80%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E9%81%8B%E5%8B%95'>Luddite movement - Wikipedia</a>.

 I solved this one the other day (what was it, a math seminar?). I was teaching it to a friend just now because it was interesting, but it suddenly caught my attention.
 
 What is the minimum size that would determine the answer if we created a space of 9 3x3 squares and initially placed no numbers at all?
 
 In the case of 2x2, and I realized that it is quite a pain to describe the shape in a blog after writing this much

 Assume the same alphabet is the same area. So, this would be.

 So, 1 and 3 are up, 2 and 4 are down, and so on. So

 Oh, no.
 
 A beer called Blue Demon of India is delicious.
 And without the support of the code while sober, this problem is impossible for me.
