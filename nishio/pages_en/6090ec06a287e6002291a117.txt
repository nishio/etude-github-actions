 *1288554629*Misconceptions about locals.
 Python 2.6 or something like that.
 >|python|
 >>> def foo():
 ...   locals()["hoge"] = 1
 ...   print hoge
 ... 
 >>> foo()
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
   File "<stdin>", line 3, in foo
 NameError: global name 'hoge' is not defined
 ||<
 I thought that the local namespace was unwritable due to optimization and that what locals() returned was a dictionary-like copy of the local namespace.
 
 But this just means that LOAD_GLOBAL is set because hoge doesn't exist at compile time.
 >|python|
 >>> import dis
 >>> dis.dis(foo)
   2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)
               3 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (locals)
               6 CALL_FUNCTION            0
               9 LOAD_CONST               2 ('hoge')
              12 STORE_SUBSCR        
 
   3          13 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (hoge)
              16 PRINT_ITEM          
              17 PRINT_NEWLINE       
              18 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              21 RETURN_VALUE

 This way, you can see the rewrite properly.
 
 >|python|
 >>> def foo():
 ...   locals()["hoge"] = 1
 ...   print eval("hoge")
 ... 
 >>> foo()
 1

 This is correct, and the only reason it can be eval'd is because the behavior when locals() is rewritten is undefined, so it just happens to be eval'd for implementation.
