What you want to do and what you have done
[https://gyazo.com/94ba694e1e4dfdd1a8953b577e21a0a0]

----
I've been thinking a lot about [what I want to do].
	[putting into words what you want to do].
	[Expanding what we can do creates what we want to do].
	[There is no set of things I want to do.]

I'm starting to feel like it's better to think on the axis of [what I want to do] and [what I don't want to do], and [what I have done] and [what I haven't done].

I want to do something, but I've never done it before.

	Naturally, "If you want to do it so badly, why haven't you done it?" is a question that comes to mind.
	You say you want to do it, but you don't want to do it that badly." They may think
	Someone says, "I appreciate people with prototypes."
		A prototype is anything related to what you want to do but have never done.
		By "doing" it, "what you haven't done yet" will gravitate to the side of "what you have done."

		The "almost there" feeling is different when comparing those who have built a prototype to those who haven't.

The "I can do it because I've done something similar before" pattern

 	We've done this, we've done that, so we can make the ☆ marks we propose."
 		I know you can do it. So, is that something you want to do?" They ask, "Is that what you want to do?
 		I don't know about "wanting to do it."
 		I don't know why you want to do it.

I don't know what I want to do" pattern
	Wanting to do something is in the heart of each individual.
		It's not up to me, from the outside, to control a situation where I don't know that.
	You mistakenly think you have to find something you've never done and want to do from the start.

		I'm looking only that way, trying to find a star in the moiety in the lower right.
		I don't know much about what I haven't done, so I'm spinning my wheels thinking about it.
		You can think about it by focusing on what you have done
