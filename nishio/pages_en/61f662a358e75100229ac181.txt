The Secret of Longevity
The virtuous life never ends. =[The wise man is immortal].

The Secret of Longevity
xc 

Live the good life. Folly and immorality are two things that bring life to a swift end. Some lose life because they lack the intelligence to sustain it, others because they lack the will. As virtue is its own reward, so vice is its own punishment. He who lives a quick life runs through life in a double sense. A virtuous life never dies. The firmness of the soul is transmitted to the body, and the good life is long not only in its intention but also in its extension.
