　　　It's easy if you can prove you can turn it off.
　　　If you can't erase it, you can always erase it next time by putting it in such a way that the same color as the next color among the three colors on the left, right and current color is exposed.

　　I think I can make it about 2^21.
　Official Explanation
　　No, there is a user commentary: https://kort0n.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/01/08/002039
