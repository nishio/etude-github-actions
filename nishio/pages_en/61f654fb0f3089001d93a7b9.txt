Must not be unsociable.
lxxiv 

The most populated places are inhabited by the truest beasts. Unapproachability is the fault of those who distrust themselves and whose honor changes their manners. You cannot win the favor of others if you offend their good moods. It is a sight to see one of these unsympathetic monsters be so majestically irreverent. Dependents who have the misfortune to have to talk with them enter the room as if they were preparing for a fight with a tiger armed with patience and fear. These people must sell their favors to all in order to obtain their position, but once they have obtained it, they seek to compensate themselves by dishonoring all. As a condition of their position, they should be able to treat everyone, but because of pride and resentment, they are unable to treat anyone. The civil way to punish such people is to leave them alone and deprive them of the opportunity to improve by denying them the chance to interact.
