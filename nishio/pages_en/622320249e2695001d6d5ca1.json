The [story intersection] becomes [atom].
　Let's say there are two [stories] here.
　　Texts written by two people on related topics
　　Writings by myself now and three years ago.
 There is some overlap between the two stories.

 　We'll call it a story intersection.
 　In the KJ method and the Kozane method:.
 　 Carve two stories into a kozane and place them in space
 　 Kozane from different stories gather in one place so you can notice them.
 　 Specific examples: [it is easier to write if you don't expect others to respond].
 　In Scrapbox:.
 　 You can notice it by a link in a page you wrote three years ago that unexpectedly leads to the page you are writing now.
 Calling it "[an atom]" is [consistent] with the metaphor "[an atom is a function, not a part]"
 	[not "write in parts"].
 		>If you describe writing [atomic] as "writing in parts", the image is somewhat off. It seems to me that it cannot accomplish anything on its own. Rather, "let's write it functionally" is closer to "let's write it functionally.
		[Function created for big picture and reuse.]
			>By grouping and naming the [semantically coherent] code, it is easier to understand what the code is doing. Then, by making the function usable by calling it from elsewhere, it can be reused. (Technology Supporting Coding, p.56)
		Since the item has appeared twice in existing stories, it can be reused a third time or later by hanging it up.
		The parts are not made in advance, but there is a story first, and then parts of the story are cut out after the fact.
