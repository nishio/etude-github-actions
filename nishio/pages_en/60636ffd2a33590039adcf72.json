Speaking up could change things for the better.
Why did [public opinion] change so rapidly? I guess some people may wonder, but what has changed is not public opinion, but perhaps the silent people who had given up and thought, "Even if I speak out, nothing will change anyway," have changed to "If I speak out, maybe things will change for the better.
I am sure that one of the reasons for the change in the world's mood from "things will never change anyway" to "speaking up might change things for the better" is that Minister Kono picked up voices on the Internet and Twitter and made "speaking up might change things" visible.
