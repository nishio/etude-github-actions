Turning its back on capitalism to promote Japanese-style management
>[osamu419: https://twitter.com/osamu419/status/1379750301268250625] The expression is apt, but I somehow think that different ideal kaisha have different governance methods. The good old Japanese companies wanted to go to the right if possible, but after the collapse of the bubble economy, foreign investors became shareholders and they had to go to the ideal of capitalism, and the laws and TSE policies are moving in that direction. On the other hand, there is no end to fraud.
	nishio: I thought it would be easier to understand if [campfire] was written and pretended to be "philosophy" in the new management diagram. It should be in the intersection of the Venn diagram in [making corporate philosophy a resolution item for the general shareholders meeting].
>[https://twitter.com/osamu419/status/1379941406488158209 @osamu419]: @nishio Indeed! I guess it would be something like this. It's detailed, but I increased the overlap of the circle between shareholders and friends. LOL.

Turn your back on [capitalism] and promote [Japanese-style management].
