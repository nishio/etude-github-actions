Fortune can only be observed when it occurs.
People perceive the absence of [good luck] as "[business as usual]".

Those who did not take actions to increase the probability of the occurrence of good fortune have difficulty in recognizing that they thereby have a low incidence of good fortune.
　People who are taking actions to increase the frequency of observed "good luck" can recognize that the frequency of observed "good luck" is increasing, so they can learn that "this action is beneficial to increase [the rate of good luck]".
