I wrote the manuscript by hand because I don't know much about writing manuscripts with digital tools or anything like that." The manuscript is for sale at [NFT]."

If it were possible to own [handwritten manuscripts] by Hirosue at [NFT], I'm sure there would be people who would want to write them.
　Handwritten manuscripts with your favorite phrases on them, framed and displayed, [emo].
　I thought it was a good use of NFT.
