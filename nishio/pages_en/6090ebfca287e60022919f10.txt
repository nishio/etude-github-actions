 At first, I wondered "Why is the third slot so empty? I was a bit puzzled at first, but then I realized that it was a "9:00/not 9:00" split.

 **1231008382* Regarding helpful advice on the internet.
 >>
 Let go of all the various helpful (well, maybe actually helpful) advice and counsel that abounds on the Internet, I assure you, it is of no use to you. They don't know you, and they don't know your spouse. By the way, it is a violation of the Medical Practitioners Law if a doctor diagnoses a disease and dictates a treatment without examining you. Keep in mind that the advice that abounds on the Internet is nothing more than illegal advice.

 I thought it said something very important, so I quoted it to get more exposure.
 
 When I look at the answers to questions in my field of expertise on Tutekuru.goo or Hatena Jinryoku Searches, I see answers that seem to be pretty much random, or answers that seem to be serious but are misguided. The same goes for the topic of psychosomatic medicine. I'm not good at it, nor am I a specialist, but I see a lot of crazy answers. It seems that there are many people in every field who don't know much but want to act like they do.
 
 The only thing irresponsible third parties on the Internet can do is to say, "You may be anxious, but you shouldn't worry alone, you should consult a specialist. In the Bukuma comments, there are people who irresponsibly say again, "If I see a doctor, I will be drugged." Instead of justifying your fear of going to a hospital with such a reason, you should go to a hospital and say, "I'm worried about taking medicine. An honest hospital will use a treatment method that does not use drugs, or if it is absolutely necessary, they will explain why it is necessary. If you don't get a satisfactory explanation, go to another hospital and get a second opinion. In fact, I've seen case reports of people with developmental disorders who were given the wrong prescription because the first doctor they went to wasn't familiar with developmental disorders. Even experts who have passed difficult tests are not perfect, so you can't trust the advice on the Internet, which is not even an expert.

 <body>There is too much time difference between Hikari and Nozomi, even though there is not much difference in price.

 <body>>There is no way you can trust advice on the internet that is not even from an expert. <BR>What are the chances that the person giving helpful advice and giving a terse answer is an "expert who has passed the hard test"? <br>You can't explain something without some knowledge of it, can you? </body>

 <body>How do you do? I would like to comment (or ask a question) because this is an interesting topic for a case I am working on. <BR><BR>I think the conclusion depends on whether the topic is about the internet in general or about a specific field. <BR><BR>The product should not be a complete commodity (still in its diffusion phase). <BR><BR>As a user, you must also evolve. In other words, from "literate" to "highly skilled". <BR><BR>Manufacturers are not involved in directly supporting the "high skills" of users, as they are incorporating them as a feature of their products and spreading (maturing) them. <br>It is more of a trade-off. <BR><BR>It may be that it is the dealers (staff) and specialists who follow up on this, but it is a trade-off due to cost issues. <br><br>Now what should users do? I think this is where Q&A and word-of-mouth comes in, but as the article says, "crap" gets mixed in. <BR>What I can think of is something like a registration system or /.J moderation. <BR>I'm wondering if perhaps a business that can back up experts with added financial incentives would be the solution. <BR><BR>I like Web 2.0 type stories so this is a long story. Sorry about that. </body>

 <body>>Asking an uninformed layperson to judge between an expert who has passed a difficult exam and a know-it-all layperson is a terrible thing to do<br>How do we know if someone is a layperson or an expert on the Web...<br>Before that, there are many experts who say charlatans things, right? <BR><BR>I mean, if you find a mistake, you should write the correct answer there or on your blog. <BR>What about conclusions like "it can't be trusted" without that kind of output? I'm not sure. </body>

 <body>This is Yuichiro Kimura, though I question your conscience.ã€€<BR>If you are going to write something appropriate after having someone's death in front of you and leaving it at that,<BR>I think it would be better for you to stop because everyone will misunderstand. <br>I have said this many times on Twitter, but it seems that you are still very busy, so I wrote this. <br>I look forward to your reply. </body>
