Create an explicit beginning
from [pKeicho-done]

	When someone says "bye-bye" and you stop responding, and someone says "let's talk," you respond only to that person's words and engage in conversation.
	It's kept in state on a person-by-person basis.

Create an explicit beginning
		(command)â†’"What would you like to see happen in this conversation?"
			Now a "reset" will make this happen.
			Or maybe "wake up" if you want to introduce the "sleeping state."
	wake word
		Better start the session with "hi nisbot" or something.
	It's a sleeping metaphor, and it's odd that when you're talking to one person, you ignore the others talking to you.
	Like, "nisbot, listen."
