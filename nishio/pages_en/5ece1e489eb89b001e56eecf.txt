Differences in communication between generations
>I don't want to make this too much of a generational debate, but many people in their 40s and older see "[communication] = [interest adjustment]. They try to control the flow of information to make the organization run smoothly. As a result, they intentionally hide information or create [information gaps]. In other words, communication is the art of persuasion and control, not the goal of conveying correct information.

>In 1998, communication was mainly one-on-one, either in person, by phone, or by e-mail. Writing to an unspecified number of people was not very common at that time. One-on-one messages were a strong intention toward the other person, an approach to a person.
>After about 2002, PCs and the always-connected Internet became widespread, and with the popularization of blogs, communication became possible on a one-to-many basis, with no receiver in mind.
> It is not a message that is intended to address someone, but rather a "here is what I think" that is not intended for anyone in particular, and that is not intended for an audience.
