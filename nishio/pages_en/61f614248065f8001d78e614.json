What you call assets or unearned income.
Certain concepts, no matter what term you call them, are contaminated by [fraudsters] when they are popularized. This is because the concept is strongly associated with human greed.

The term "[asset]" is used to sell something that is not an asset by explaining that it is an asset to "customers who want to have an asset but don't really know what an asset is. Buyers become strong supporters of the scammer's theory because they do not want to admit that they have lost money due to their own stupidity.

The term "[unearned] income" is used to explain to customers who cannot think, "There are strict requirements for obtaining it, and in that sense it is difficult. If it were easy to get it, many people would do it and it would be considered 'natural.'" It is used to sell the means of acquisition to customers who cannot think of it, explaining, "You can easily get it by doing this. There are not zero people who have earned unearned income by using such means. However, not everyone can acquire income through this method.

Some people falsely believe that the concept itself is false because the words used to refer to the concept have been contaminated by fraudsters. This is because they do not learn the history themselves, but only see the advertisements made by fraudsters.
