Arrange sticky notes on a polypropylene sheet.
2019-05-23
The [Sailor Fountain Pen Anywhere Sheet https://amzn.to/2HZKKzp] sticks to walls with static electricity and allows writing with a whiteboard marker.
I experimented with this in 2015. [2015-05-23Facebook https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206002612520926&set=a.1175498944176&type=3&theater]
Not recommended, but noted for the record.

	Good points compared to posting stickies directly on the floor
		Good sticking power
			(Supplemental 2019) Unless the floor is wiped with water, there is a thin layer of dust and other debris that adheres to the sticky glue.
		Able to write
	Bad points, tends to pack in due to the edges.

Can be moved directly to the wall.

Hard to fold because of the sticky note.

(2019補足)
	Difficult to fold and store, but also could not continue to occupy walls and floors, which was not very good.

　This has nothing to do with the polypropylene sheet, so I cut it out on another page (2022).
 [Need to get more output to more people to get more feedback].
