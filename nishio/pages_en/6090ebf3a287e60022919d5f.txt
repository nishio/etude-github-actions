 ** I'm sleepy.
 
 Thinking about it, I woke up at 4:00 a.m. today.
 Sleepy.
 Let's go home and sleep.
 
 
 ** Code
 
 >|python|
 class TopicForm(_TopicForm, CommentForm):    
     typ = forms.ChoiceField(
         widget=forms.RadioSelect(),
         choices=models.TOPIC_STATE_CHOICE,
         label=_("State"),
         initial="public")

 Ho. So this is what happens.

 Hmmm. I can't think of any examples of it failing.
 
 
 ** Riddle
 
 Why do I get stars and "congratulations on your Hatena debut" just for moving to Hatena Diary?
