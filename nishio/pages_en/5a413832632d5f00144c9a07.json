empathy
A thought that makes you feel as if you could observe something about another person's inner life that is unobservable.
Sometimes people think they have or don't have "empathy" based on the slightest success or failure. [Excessive generalization].

It is not a special ability to read the inner life of others that cannot be observed,
In some cases, we understand by listening to the other person carefully. Sometimes the term [listening] is used.
There is an expression, "One mouth, two ears, and you need to hear twice as much as you speak."

When a sufficient amount of information is collected from a particular person, it becomes possible to emulate that person's thought patterns.
It is easy to do, especially for those who think in logic, because if you know what they are given, you can emulate them in logic. see [Axiom System Differences].
Sometimes it is described as "acquiring a [mental model]."
