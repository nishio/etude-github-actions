Different people prefer different output formats, but it's a matter of familiarity
	Many homo sapiens prefer [one-dimensional] [output format
	　[voice interaction] due to the fact that it is so.
	　Because that's what we've always done.
	　experience
　Bulleted discussions on Scrapbox are tree-like with each line written by a different person
　　Similar to co-editing a [mind map].
　　There are those who think this tree-like output is possible and those who think it's a mess.
　　　In the end, it's a matter of getting used to it.
　Some people use [illustrations] or one-panel cartoons.
　　Often it is easier to draw than to explain in words.
　　Avoid this output format if you are uncomfortable drawing.
	Formalities are constraints
  When writing a normal sentence, the constraint of "the sentences before and after are connected" is included.
 	 I'm loosening the restriction that the bullet points don't have to be connected at the time of dedent.
 	 The circular page adds the restriction that the end of the page must be connected to the beginning of the page.
　　Some people are more literate with restrictions and some are more literate without.
　　　Easier to read with and easier to write without.
　　　The degree of "ease" of doing so depends on familiarity.
