 **1273753908* Considerations on teaching creativity.
 How can creativity be educated?
 
 As <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%92 %E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%83%AD%E3%83%A0'>Erich Fromm</a> says, As Erich Fromm</a> says, there is an aspect of education that "creates people who think like machines. What does it mean to think like a machine? Does it mean that the same input returns the same output? That is certainly easy to imagine. There are people who excel in schooling, but who are bored and only respond in a routine manner. What kind of education would prevent the mass production of such people?
 
 Don't we need to educate people that "there is more than one correct answer" and that "it's okay to answer a question with a correct answer that isn't on the list of correct answers, and that's great?" Isn't it strange to have only a list of correct answers on the answer page and say that if you didn't pick the correct answer, you are wrong? If it doesn't contradict the conditions set by the contestant, then it should be the correct answer, right?
 
 Religious brainwashing that what is written in textbooks is the only truth should stop being embraced with compulsory education. Textbooks are also created by people, so it is natural to think that there may be mistakes in them. The fact that people do not think so is evidence of the blind faith they have formed in the sacred scriptures called textbooks.
 
 There should be classes that give positive incentives to give different answers than others.

 <body>I think you mean that people will be thinking in various ways with no real correct answer...but what is difficult is how many people can be educated while discussing "what is good and what is bad about that line of thinking? Then again, the classes will not be something that everyone can take equally, and I wonder if it might be better to separate the elite education from the base-up education. </body>

 <body>Hmmm...I did write "we need to have what kind of education," but if you ask me "should everyone have that what kind of education?" I can't say "yes" to that question. Everyone should be given the chance to receive such education, but there is no point in forcing those who do not want to receive it to do so. </body

 <body>Here I am, constantly on the lookout for an opportunity to declare in math class, "Teacher, there is another way to solve this problem. <BR><BR>An announcement of an alternative solution was appreciated in its own way. <BR><BR>Even if it is not on the answer page, if the answer is correct and the logic is not wrong, it has to be the correct answer. <BR><BR>Oh, maybe that's why I enjoyed math the most. </body>
