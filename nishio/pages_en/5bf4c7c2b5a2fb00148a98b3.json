When I think about this together with the [management-oriented one-night werewolf explanation], I realized that in werewolf games, the human side is special if they play honestly, but the werewolf side loses money. The human side has already revealed to the werewolf side that he/she is a human, so there is no loss if he/she plays honestly.
However, the position holders are not included.

Therefore, it is a game where position holders and werewolves fight.
If a villager honestly says, "I'm a villager," it gives the wolf a hint that there are able-bodied people left.
