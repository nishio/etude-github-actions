problem for which there is no answer
The term "[problem] with no [answer]" has a low resolution. There is a difference between "a problem for which [the answer] is unknown but can be [verified] after the fact to see if the answer is correct" and "a problem that cannot even be verified.

A [complete problem] is one that we know has an answer, but the answer itself is not yet known" ([Kohei Okubo]).
	This is what happens when you flesh out "a problem without an answer is still incomplete as a problem." [src https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10219157109215122]
