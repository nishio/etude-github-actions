Drawing lines
By drawing lines, we can express the [relationships between distant objects].

Drawing lines is not included in the original [Kozane method]. Also, in the [KJ method], drawing lines is done after the spatial arrangement is completed.

Why? Because [Kozane method]/[KJ method] are created in the age of pen and paper.
Once you draw a line with a pen, you can't move objects on either end of the line. So you can't draw lines until everything is moved and the location is finalized.

Now [Kozaneba] the electronic software solved the problem.
You can draw a line between objects whose position has not yet been determined, and then move them again.
Kozaneba surpassed the limits of the pen-and-paper methods. I feel it useful and do not want to go back to paper anymore.

However, I am not sure it is beneficial to users who are not familiar with Kozane method/KJ method.
The function to draw lines gives the user more options. When there is a relationship between two objects, the user must choose whether to express the relationship by "[putting them close together]" or by "[drawing a line between them]." It increases the [burden] until users see benefit of Kozaneba.

I have been doing the [Kozane method]/[KJ method] on paper for 10 years and has seen the benefits. In other words, drawing lines is not essential for the benefits.
If you are wondering which is better between "putting them close together" and "drawing a line between them", you should better to put them close together.

[* About the word "line"]
Lines are describing the [relationship between distant objects].
This "distant objects" is not necessarily only two things.
I call the concept "line" because I haven't found a good word for it.
