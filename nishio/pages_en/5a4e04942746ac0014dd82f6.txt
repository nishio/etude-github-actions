Scrapbox is a purifier of ideas
see [/daiiz/Scrapbox is a refiner of ideas].

 The first idea you come up with contains noise, and once you write it down, you realize it.
 When laid down, "[test of time]" and "[similarity -> difference? will occur.
 Gradually the noise is removed and we get to the core idea.
 	[Gaining Inclusiveness]
 Talking about the importance of implementing that core idea.

I do something similar to this in the process of writing through the "Write Down Method" and the "Repeat KJ Method".

PS
 I thought about this when I wrote [There are two types of genus elimination].
 With blogs and such, this is the organizing stage before you say what you want to say.
 But that's a "big" idea, and it involves multiple things.
 What I wanted to say after this sorting out was that I thought it depended on this, but not as a concept.
 So the page should be divided
