 *1211201535*Shibuya
 
 I thought I was on a train bound for Asakusa, but when I saw people getting off at once, I realized it was Omotesando. I thought, "I'll just sit here because the next stop is Shibuya," but I heard it was going into the garage. But I heard that the train was going into the garage.
 
 *1211214605*Higurashi
 At the convenience store on the train on my way home, I saw "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Onikakushi Hen (All)", so I thought "Oh, it's a read-aloud" and bought it.
 
 I was scared to death. The way he changed.
 
 And it wasn't a read-through.
 
 >>
 This work can be divided into two parts: the first part is the first part of the story, "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni" (the first four parts are called "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni" or "Problems"), which presents the problems in the first part of the story. The other is the second part, "Higurashi no Nakukoro ni Koro ni Solution," which is the solution to the riddles presented in the first part.

 Grrr.
 
 *1211222308*Rain
 It's raining so hard.
 I don't like it.
 
 I was messing around with GreaseMonkey a bit, and it's already 3:30 am, even though I was planning to go to bed at 24:00... Hmmm.
