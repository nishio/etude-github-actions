Engineering for Aging
[Engineering" is a learning environment where "when your understanding is wrong, you are pointed out the error by a non-human, and you are not told what the correct answer is. I think this is a good prescription for the old saying, "[As you get older,] no one tells you what the right answer is.
Not only engineering, but anything that "leaves the evaluation to non-human things, and where the evaluation is clearly good or bad" would have the same effect. Like archery.
