Not changing jobs does not mean maintaining the status quo.

I guess the difference is whether or not you can relate to the part about "changing the company and yourself."
Listening to people who have changed jobs from large companies complain, "[the company] can't be changed" is a very strong mental model, and since they base their considerations on this premise, they may conclude that "that's why you need to change jobs".
