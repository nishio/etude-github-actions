Faster context switches
 When I told our resident consultant (my wife) about the tight time available for writing, she said, "You're remarkably bad at [multitasking], aren't you?
 Wife: "If we can't [multitask], we have to think about how to improve performance with single tasks. If we can't eliminate interrupts, then we have to reduce the cost of recovering from interrupts."
  I see, faster [context switches].
 I examined the differences in their behavior patterns and found that the difference was that I write my TODOs in a notebook, while my wife writes them on a bundle of lined paper.
 The difference is that my wife's copy GC runs at least once a day, while mine only runs about twice a month. Lowering the cost of paper makes it possible to use it up in a wealthy way.
 Wife: "If you have so many minutes that it's painful to refresh once a day, that's too much writing."
	Wife: "If your TODO list paper is full in the morning, you're writing too much because there's not enough space to write down the events that will happen that day."
  Limited paper space creates a bias to write compactly.
  Compact and can be loaded at a glance.
  Lazy writing in a notebook won't make this happen.
