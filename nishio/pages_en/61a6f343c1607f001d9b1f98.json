I want to lightly organize how Keichobot works.

[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[/nishio/human.icon]I want to lightly organize how Keichobot works.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "Keichobot" is that "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Asking questions for user input
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "user" is that "user"?
[/nishio/human.icon]who have not yet clearly recognized what it is that they want to talk about.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "recognize" is that "recognize"?
[If you have a clear idea of what you want to talk about, you can just write it down and you don't need Keichobot to ask you questions, but since it is not yet clear, you need to shed light on it and clarify it by asking questions.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about that "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon] "Keyword Extraction" and select keywords that look good and ask questions about them.

 Where is this "Keichobot" located?
[/nishio/human.icon]By the user

 Where is this "Keichobot" located?
[/nishio/human.icon]To be precise, it's a smartphone near the user, connecting to a server far away.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Anything else about that "user"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Hmmm, maybe the explanation of how it works here should focus on the knowledge that users can use Keichobot better, in particular? If so, I think it would be useful to know that "Keichobot judges frequently occurring words as important words" and how it works.
[/nishio/kei.icon]How do you know its "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]I'm explaining this because users don't know much about Keichobot, I'm the creator so I know the insides, but users don't.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you value?
[/nishio/human.icon]Well, when I started this chat, I only thought "I need to explain how it works", but you saw the value in "explaining how it works so that users can use it better".
[/nishio/kei.icon]How do you know its "users"?
[/nishio/human.icon]It may be important to encourage users to write down their impressions after using the product, since there is no way to know more about it unless they write down their impressions in a visible place.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where do these "users" come from?
[/nishio/human.icon]As far as this time is concerned, I'm going to give a presentation within the company, so I hope people within the company who saw the presentation will use it.

 Where is this "user" located?
[/nishio/human.icon]Well, I don't expect that to be the case. The population of people who would find this service valuable at this point is so small that it would not be very useful to narrow it down to a narrow market of in-house people.

 What would you like to see happen with respect to this "user"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Use it and hope it helps the person.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What needs to happen to the "user" for that to happen?
[/nishio/human.icon]First of all, we need to "try to use it" and the results of using it need to be fruitful.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > It may be important to encourage users to write down their impressions of the product, since there is no way to know more about it unless they use it and write down their impressions in a visible place.
 What does this "user" seem to be?
[/nishio/human.icon]Like a seed. Spread water widely, and some seeds suck it up and put out roots. The seed that takes root absorbs more water and grows bigger. It is not necessary for all of the land to sprout, and even if that were to happen, it would die due to lack of sunlight. Only a very small number of sprouts should grow and grow large.

 > It may be important to encourage users to write down their impressions of the product, since there is no way to know more about it unless they use it and write down their impressions in a visible place.
 Where is this "user" located?
[/nishio/human.icon]Cannot be observed until sprouting.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > I'm explaining it because users don't know much about Keichobot, I'm the creator so I know the internals, but users don't.
 What do you hope will happen regarding this "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]This is water, and it is good to meet a species that is looking for water

 What is the relationship between this "user" and Keichobot?
[/nishio/human.icon]I was thinking in terms of the seed/water metaphor, not just Keichobot, which happens to sprout when it rains. It's a mismatch with the plant metaphor, but it's a system that allows plants to turn on their own sprinklers when they want water, instead of waiting for it to rain.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is that "Keichobot" the same as "user"? Is it different?
[/nishio/human.icon]Originally different but can merge to become one system

 What happens to "Keichobot" when this "user"
[/nishio/human.icon](I don't want to delve into this place this time.
