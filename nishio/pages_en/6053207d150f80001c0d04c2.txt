[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I want to talk about [nishio.icon] I can now put it on the home screen.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "home screen" is that "home screen"?
[nishio.icon] The screen where application icons are lined up. Keicho is now lined up there as well.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "Keicho" is that "Keicho"?
[nishio.icon]About this chat. With the conventional method of following a bookmark, you had to "open the browser first" (where you would see extra content), "open the bookmark list" (to find Keicho in the list written in text), and "select". This is no longer necessary.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "Keicho"?
[nishio.icon]It's something I use when I want to organize my mind, so I don't want to distract myself with unnecessary information or do unnecessary work when I want to use it.

 Where is this "Keicho" located?
[nishio.icon]I used to explain that "it's in your phone and you can use it anywhere," but now I've added to that "it's on your home screen and you can call it up with one touch.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "home screen"?
[nishio.icon]The first screen is even easier to access.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "screen" is that "screen"?
The [nishio.icon] application icons are lined up, so with Keicho, the robot icon is displayed. The displayed icon was also changed from the React default icon until recently.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its "Keicho"?
[nishio.icon] You can easily find it because it is placed on the home screen with a distinctive icon.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]It's something that can be called up quickly and without any extra effort or irritation.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "hassle" is that?
