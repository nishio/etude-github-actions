Phase and Proximity
When we consider "[distance]" as a concept to express "[proximity]" in a simple way,"[distance]" implicitly assumes that a [real number] value of distance corresponds between two points. The fact that the distance is a real number implicitly assumes [total order].
However, there are use cases where the whole order is not necessarily necessary for the proximity argument.
In [topology], "closer" is [semi-ordered] because "there is an [open set] that is in [inclusion relation] and is an element of the inner open set".

Definition of phase
Let X be a set and [$ \mathcal{O}] be a subset of the power set [$ \mathfrak{P}(X)].
When [$ \mathcal{O}}] satisfies the following property, the pair [$ (X,{\mathcal {O}})] is called a topological space with X as the platform set and [$ \mathcal{O}}] as the open set system, and the source of [$ \mathcal{O}] is called an open set in X.
1. [$ \emptyset ,X\in {\mathcal {O}}]
2. [$ \forall O_{1},O_{2}\in {\mathcal {O}}~~:~~O_{1}\cap O_{2}\in {\mathcal {O}}]
3. [$ \forall \{O_{\lambda }\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda }\subset {\mathcal {O}}~~:~~\bigcup _{\lambda \in \Lambda }O_{\lambda }\in {\mathcal {O}}]
