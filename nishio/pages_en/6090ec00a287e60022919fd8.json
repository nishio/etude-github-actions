 I thought "I can do that with FFT" because it is very slow to write my own Gaussian, but that would be easy to apply the same blur to the whole image, but not suitable for writing many Gaussians with different variances.
 
 Is it absolutely too slow to calculate exp every time and so on, so I should calculate the density function with a certain magnitude in advance and use that value? I'm not sure it would be faster. I guess the argument is which is better, accessing memory or calculating exp. I wonder if the argument is on the level of cache or not. I don't know enough about it.

 <body>I don't know about Gaussian, but I do know good Median and Bilateral blurring. <br>Please check out the paper "Fast Median and Bilateral Filtering" written by Ben Weiss of Shell & Slate Software Corp. </body>

 <body>Or, even so, it would be better to omit the part that looks at the difference in luminance from the Bilateral Filter.
