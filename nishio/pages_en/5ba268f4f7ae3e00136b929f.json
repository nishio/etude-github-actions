Equality v.s. Equity
It's hard to translate, but let's call it [Equality and Equity]. #Equality #Equity #Fairness [Equality], [Equity].

It is misleading to look at a picture like this and think, "I see, Equity is better!" It is misleading to think

The first picture
	It's about something that doesn't diminish with [distribution], which is "watching the game."
		It doesn't make it 1/3 as much fun to watch with 3 people as it is to watch alone.
		When money and other ordinary items are distributed, the per capita share is reduced.
 The subject is "height," a [disparity] that cannot be overcome by individual effort.
	Tall people have excessive boxes from the start.
 	That person loses nothing by giving up the box.
 In this situation, it would be optimal for the taller person to give up the box to the shorter person, but the implicit assumption of this picture is quite specific, so it is not something that can be generalized
	 Most things in the world are "lose-lose if you let go."
	 Most things in the world are reduced when distributed among a large number of people.
	 Some disparities in the world cannot be overcome by individual effort, but some cannot.
	So this picture is based on the premise that there are people who are losing money due to handicaps that cannot be resolved through individual effort, and that there are means to eliminate their losses without anyone losing anything.

About the second picture
　There are three more foundation boxes, but where did they take them from?
 If not more boxes.
 	They will all be at the same height as the person in the center.
  It comes down to "they can't all reap the fruits."
  Is that okay? It's not okay, is it?
 　In this situation, why don't you just have the tall one harvest three of them and share them with the other two without having to come and get the box?

There was a picture involving [justice]: [Equality, Equity, Justice].

When the Japanese people want to eliminate [disparities].
　[100,000 in welfare, four times higher income than the rest of the world].
　　So, of course, in the eyes of the world as a whole, we're "the ones who give away what we have."
　However, I think many Japanese mistakenly believe that reducing the disparity will increase the amount they receive.
　If you want to reduce inequality, donate money to poor countries, anyone can do it right now.
