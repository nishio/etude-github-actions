The blocked one is the normal state.
>[piro_or https://twitter.com/piro_or/status/1480085718332735495]: Every so often, a quoted tweet that flows down my timeline has become invisible, and I accidentally figure out that I am blocked by that person. I am uncomfortable every time I accidentally figure out that I am blocked by that person, because if I had remained unaware, my mind wouldn't have been boggled.

>[yomoyomo https://twitter.com/yomoyomo/status/1480119858985848835]: This is really true, every time someone who is often quoted RT in my observation range tells me I'm blocked and we've had some sort of exchange. I don't blame them if they have, but it makes me wonder why this person hates me so much, and it really boggles my mind.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1480123160775499776]: I have such cases from time to time, but since there are more people in the world than I can recognize anyway, I don't think it's reasonable to devote cognitive resources to those who block me. I think I ignore them and they cease to exist in my world (I can't remember how many there are, because I forget them easily).

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1480187642704969737]: Most people block most of the human race because they don't speak the language they are used to, so it doesn't affect many people if someone uses some Japanese but doesn't speak it. It doesn't affect many people when people who use some Japanese but don't understand their language block them.
