Validate Runtypes
Until now, when a user tried to import a JSON file, the only thing we could do was "if isTItem is false, display invalid item" for each item to be imported.
　When I moved to [Runtypes], "what is false due to a mismatch" was in the DETAILS.
　It would be nice to show this to the user so they can easily see what's wrong with that JSON.

code:ts
   const result = RTItem.validate({
     type: "kozane",
     position: [],
     id: "A",
     text: "A",
   });
   if (!result.success) {
     console.log(result.details);
   }
code::
  console.log
    {
      position: 'Failed constraint check for [number, number]: Expected length 2, but was 0',
      scale: 'Expected number, but was missing'
    }
