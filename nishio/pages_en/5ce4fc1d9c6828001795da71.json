Scaling of 100 sticky notes on iPad
	Enough free space is needed for grouping after displaying 100 stickies.
	If you can easily zoom in and out with a two-finger gesture on the iPad, it's less of a burden on humans.
	See if this is feasible.

We should [implement adding stickies on Paper.js] first.
	Right now, I'm reusing 5 year old code to make stickies in SVG.
	But if I think about using Apple Pencil for handwritten input in the future, I wonder if it would be better to use canvas.
	SVG and canvas may behave differently when scaling

Scaling of 100 sticky notes on iPad
	What we want to achieve with Regroup is a high [listability] of [two-dimensional arrangement].
	When I built something similar five years ago, it could only display a mere 70 pictures.
		So we decided that it was "not yet time to go electronic.
		After displaying 100 stickies, sufficient free space was needed for grouping.
		At the time, the image was for use with Macbooks and other PCs.
	Now relaunched is the image used on the iPad.
		The difference between zooming out to view the whole picture and viewing individual stickies in detail is the difference in zoom level
		It should be easy to zoom in and out with the two-finger gesture.
		If I could do that, the current iPad would be good enough for my purposes.

You should quickly verify that scaling is possible as I expect it to be.

What we could have done yesterday:.
	Create a new map
	Add image or text stickies from the script at hand to the map

next
	About 100 sheets from past lecture materials to be poured into the system.
	Scaling is implemented.
	Verified that the iPad can zoom in and out without problems.
