Rising water levels and seniority
[https://gyazo.com/b154fb30a6b6aba7754044d8cb4e09c1]
　When you live long enough, you acquire a broad and shallow knowledge by seeing and hearing many things
　　The "little boy at the gate reading a sutra he never learned" effect.
　This resulted in a situation where "elders had an advantage over the young in a wide range of areas" in the past
　　Each was strong in their respective areas of expertise, but the elders were strong in areas that were not either of their specialties.
　This composition is reversed by the development of technology that lowers the cost of acquiring shallow knowledge.
　　Is it fair to say that the degree of shallow knowledge that was naturally acquired by living long enough without making an effort to acquire knowledge can now be easily acquired through search?
　　　Without "[the power to be]" you can't take the action of searching.
　　　　Without the sense of "I don't know the details, but I'm sure there must have been something like this," no search behavior can be generated.
　　　　If you don't know the keywords, your search is inefficient.
　　　　On the other hand, this level of knowledge can be acquired more efficiently in the past through properly designed social networking timelines.
　　Knowledge acquired without conscious effort remains old because it is not consciously updated.
　　　Examples of old incorrect knowledge
　　　　'Programs cannot be patented on their own' [2002 https://www.jpo.go.jp/system/laws/rule/guideline/patent/tukujitu_kijun/kaitei/pu-kijun_cs-tekiyou.html].
　　　　'You can only expense up to 100,000.'[2006 https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/taxanswer/hojin/5408.htm]
　　　　Neon is a rare gas."[2005 https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/第18族元素]
　　Knowledge that we don't know how we acquired tends to be perceived as "common sense".
　　　Causes miscommunication with people who do not share your knowledge
