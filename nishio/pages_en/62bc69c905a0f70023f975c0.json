Kozaneba1] 〜 [Exploratory Net Study Group Kozaneba1
[Kozaneba5]
Let's verbalize what we were doing.
Usual in-house study sessions are
　Gathering materials from Monday to Wednesday, space arrangement in Kozaneba
　Narrativeizing it into presentation material on Thursday.
That's what I was doing.

This time, as I was doing one in the usual way, I said, "Isn't this almost an exploratory net?" I realized, "Isn't this almost an exploratory net?
　To visualize what is still missing and to consolidate knowledge by spatial arrangement of what has been gathered in the coverage up to a certain point.
　The same is true for spatial placement of knowledge gathered up to a certain point in a book.

So I tried to do it in a more exploratory way than I usually do.
Also, I usually make one big map without measuring time, but this time I measured it!
　It takes about 2 pomodoros to make about 100 to 150 labels, and 1 pomodoro to make a map.
　　Well, this depends on the difficulty of the target book.

This resulted in five exploratory nets.
We will cover and integrate from this exploratory net in the future.

My impression at this point is that this is the closest thing to an integrated fireworks display that we will do after the interview.
Not exploratory or thinking fireworks.
　It is essential to add one piece at a time, especially for fireworks to think

[Try Thinking Fireworks.]
[Fireworks to think about the commentary of fireworks].
