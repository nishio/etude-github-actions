 *1359774217* Differences in Prolog and Haskell behavior
 I have a coding pattern in Prolog that says to prepare foo(0) and foo(N), and when N is N, do something and then call foo(N - 1) recursively.
 
 First, let's check the behavior in Haskell.
 >||
 foo 0 = do{ print "rule1"; print 0 }
 foo n = do{ print "rule2"; print n }
 
 main = do
   foo (1 - 1)
   foo 1
   foo 0
 ||<
 
 >||
 "rule1"
 0
 "rule2"
 1
 "rule1"
 0
 ||<
 
 We see that the definition of foo 0 is called in foo(1 - 1). We can also see that only the definition of foo 0 is called in foo 0. (What an obvious thing to do, you might think, but I fell for that assumption.)
 
 Let's try to write the same way in Prolog.
 >||
 foo(0) :- print('rule1: '), print(0).
 foo(N) :- print('rule2: '), print(N).
 ||<
 
 >||
 ?- foo(1 - 1).
 rule2: 1-1
 true.
 
 ?- foo(1).
 rule2: 1
 true.
 
 ?- foo(0).
 rule1: 0
 true ;
 rule2: 0
 true.
 ||<
 
 In Prolog, first foo(1 - 1) does not match foo(0), so it is rule2; in Haskell, the timing of the pattern match forces a 1-1 evaluation to 0, but not in Prolog. Also, at foo(0), after matching rule1, it also matches rule2.
 
 If you look at examples such as the Fibonacci calculation in Prolog, it is written in a way that avoids this pitfall. I have to go out, so I'll continue later. Hint: cut and is.
 
 *1359814741* I can no longer log in to Twitter.
 Due to the "<a href='http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/1302/02/news013.html'>Possible Twitter leak of personal information including 250,000 passwords - ITmedia News</a>", Twitter The passwords to the <a href='_blanket'>Twitter</a> have been reset.
 
 It seems that those who have received an email that the system has been reset should reset from there. But I haven't received it. I thought it might be a mistake, like "wrong email address," "dead mail server," or "in spam," but that doesn't seem to be the case.
 
 First, I put the email address from my memory in the password reset screen and it says "good". If I put in a nonexistent hoge@.... .org, etc., which does not exist, I get "Invalid email address or phone number", so I guess this email address is tied to a valid account.

 Next, I sent myself an e-mail to this e-mail address. It was forwarded to GMail without any problem. So the mail server is not dead. However, when I send an email to this email address from this password reset screen, it never arrives.
 
 Finally, I checked to see if it was classified as SPAM, but it is not there either.
 
 
 I wonder what other possibilities there are. I'm starting to feel like "Twitter is not essential to my life, so if I can't use it, I'm not going to use it anymore.
 
 PS: In addition, it seems that you can post from Twitter integration from Hatena or from the Twitter application on your iPhone. I'll post this blog entry to Twitter using the Hatena linkage.
