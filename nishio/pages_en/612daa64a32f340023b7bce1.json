Over 200 classes were generated
code::
 Over 200 classes were generated for component styled.div with the id of "sc-jrsJWt".
 Consider using the attrs method, together with a style object for frequently changed styles.
 Example:
   const Component = styled.div.attrs(props => ({
     style: {
       background: props.background,
     },
   }))`width: 100%;`

I was not familiar with [styled-components] and wrote something like this, but this is not appropriate because it will create different classes for different props
code:ts
 export const KozaneDiv = styled.div`
   ...
   top: ${(props) => props.style?.top ?? "0px"};
   left: ${(props) => props.style?.left ?? "0px"};

You don't have to bother writing this, since the style is the final DOM Element style, so you can simply delete it.
