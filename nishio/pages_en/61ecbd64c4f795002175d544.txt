Parable of the ~.
The term "[metaphor]" is useful, but it may seem rigid or unfamiliar.

I like the term "[parable]." I often use it in the expression "a parable of ~."

Consider the choice of translation in translating this into English.

The "parable of the mustard seed" in the Christian Bible is a parable that many people around the world have heard. This is a parable that many people around the world have heard.

I looked up the English expression for this and found that Wikipedia has it under the heading [Parable of the Mustard Seed].

So it would not be wrong to use [PARABLE].
