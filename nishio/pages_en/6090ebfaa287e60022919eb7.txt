 *1222134589* I'm in front of the company.
 Huh? The building is closed... Oh, it's a holiday.

 I thought about what to do since I didn't want to go home like this, and decided to go see Ponyo. The only movie theater I know is Kinshicho, but I came to Shibuya because Kinshicho from Tameike-Sanno is a hassle because of the transfer.
 
 Exploring the Shibuya dungeon.
 
 If you exit the Ginza line and go to the right, you can see ranKing ranQueen and so on. I had no idea of its three-dimensional location, but it is on the second floor of a building near Hachiko. I wandered up the stairs to go outside.
 
 The movie theater is up Dogenzaka, northwest of Shibuya Station, at Shibuto Cine Tower. I remember. The Noriguchi exit of the Hanzomon Line is also on Dogenzaka. I don't know where else it is.
 
 I bought a ticket for 12:40. Now it is 11:40.

 An event occurred when a foreigner asked me the location of Bic Camera and I answered.

 I saw Ponyo. Even children can enjoy it simply for the movement alone.
 The movement of my sister's flock is too interesting.
 
 Well, I don't know how to comment without spoiling it.

 The ham thing in this is not well founded. There's no evidence that you didn't eat it, just that you didn't eat it, and you did eat it when you were a fish.
 
 I agree that "it looks like we're back in the world, but it's not really the world we were in."
