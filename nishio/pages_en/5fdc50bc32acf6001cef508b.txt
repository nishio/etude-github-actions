For all black squares, if there is a white square adjacent to the black square, it is black" is the same as "For all black squares, if there is a white square adjacent to the black square, it is black

code:python
 for x in all_white_cell:
     if any(is_black(y) for y in neighbor(x)):
         toBlack(x)

code:python
 for x in all_black_cell:
     for y in neighbor(x):
         if is_white(y):
             toBlack(y)

In the latter case, once a black square is processed, it does not have to be processed again, thus reducing the amount of calculation.
