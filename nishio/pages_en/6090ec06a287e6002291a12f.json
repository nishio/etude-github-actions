 *1294161039* Today's discarded books 44.4kg
 Whew, I'm tired.
 
 By the way, about the fact that I put the first book out to make space and then tied up the second book, and then when I went to take it out, the book I took out with the first book was already gone. After I finished taking out the second book, I went to a convenience store to buy myself a ponzu juice as a reward, and when I came back, an old man was squatting by the books and rummaging through them. Well, yes. The most expensive book was about 6,500 yen, so I might be able to make some money if I bring it to the book-off.
 
 I would rather have them do it for $1,000 if they would do it for me because it is a tedious job to spend three hours carrying books out of the house.
