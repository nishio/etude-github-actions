The reward for effort is not success, but growth.

That's where you get it wrong, which is why people think "effort is futile". If you work hard, you will surely grow. Whether you succeed or not is luck, but whether you grow or not is a choice. Failure to succeed does not mean failure to grow. It is unfair to yourself to not recognize your growth and assume that your efforts are in vain.

The [reward] of [effort] is [growth], not [success].
