Order of appearance of the five basic questions

Order of appearance of the five basic questions
	Once we stopped trying to randomize and put the questions in score order.
		Where? →Where? →What kind? →What else? →What kind?
	fixed in this order. What kinds of things in this [basic 5 questions]? ... What else? are important, so the order should be changed.
	Right now (7/2019) I'm rearranging the order of the list of questions to achieve this, but I'll take care of it when I eventually make it NN.
		What to watch out for?
	Now (2021/1) we're trying to get clogs on the "what kind" and "what else" scores to come out ahead.
	　The other three are NN, which are smaller than these two

[use case: importance of grouping].
