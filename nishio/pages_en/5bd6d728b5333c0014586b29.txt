JSONUtility
Passing a Vector3 Array to ToJson will result in `{}`.
>passing an array to this method will not produce a JSON array containing each element

You cannot [serialize] an Array directly, but you can serialize an instance of a class that has an Array as a field

When I try to JsonUtil.FromJson<Foo> it fails to compile. FromJsonOverwrite(json, foo) on a previously created Foo instance foo succeeds.

Trap where property getter seems not to be called during serialization.
