I didn't do it because I don't know how to do it.
Most people who think, "I just don't do it because I don't know how to do it, and if I did, I would do it," are not taking action to figure out how to do it.
Because they use "[I don't know]" as an [excuse not to do it], they unconsciously avoid "action to understand".
