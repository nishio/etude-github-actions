How to multitask
Me, "How do you execute [multitasking] efficiently?"
Wife: "Just turn [single task] around fast."

Me: "I think the size of the implicitly assumed single task may be different."
Wife: "In the end, humans can only do one thing at a time, so let go of the illusion of multitasking."

I said, "What do you do when you have multiple projects that can only be done one at a time and will take several months to complete?"
Wife: "There are countless smaller tasks in a long term project. One task that can be done."

I said, "For example, about this 'writing a paper' project."
Wife: "First of all, it's not good that it's not clearly stated what the paper is going to be about, and it's like, 'I'm going to be big! Like that."

	You're not seeing the whole picture.
 How about writing it out first?
 I'm not sure I have an estimate of how long it would take to do any of these things.
 I don't like to do this, but I think that by drawing a Gantt chart, I can notice if it's too dense or not.

	You may not be able to subdivide your tasks.
 Time should be malloc for task segmentation.
