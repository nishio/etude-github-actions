　Problems with foundationalism and old news
　Aim to create a [consistent] system
　The definition of a certain symbol X is no different from the mere use of X because it merely states the relationship between X and other words
　　[word means: the use of a word].
　If the same symbol is used in two places, we assume it refers to the same thing.
　　How the symbol X is used in its everyday use is of little importance
　　There is a weak assumption that it may be used in a similar way, and if there are no other clues, it is used to interpret the meaning, but if there is a contradiction, this one is discarded because the relationship in the text is stronger.
