API server placement considerations
what is appropriate to do?
　Heroku
　 If you use it infrequently, you can go with the free plan.
　 　1,000 hours per month
　  Sleeps if not used for 30 minutes
　 For $7/month, you'll be up and running all the time.
　 That's what I'm doing for the most part right now.
　 Return time from sleep could be an issue.
　 If the file size is too large, it may not fit in the free range
　 >500MB storage size for free slots on Heroku

	　HTTPS with wildcard certificate
　AWS Lambda
　　I know it's an option, but haven't tried it yet.
　　>MeCab uses native binaries in its code, so if you want to create a Python deployment package, please use the Amazon Linux AMI available at the following link to build an environment equivalent to the Lambda execution environment and create the package on that OS Please create the package on that OS.

　Netlify Function
　 I can't use Python, so it's not suitable for natural language processing.
　 I often use Netlify for static delivery of HTML+JS UI portions, so if I can consolidate, that would be better.
　AWS EC2
