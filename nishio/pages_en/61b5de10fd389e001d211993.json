Clean language: withholding interpretation of symbols
[clean language]:[withhold interpretation of symbols].
　I realized that this framework could be used to explain how the clean language I presented last time works.

　　When a person tries to put into words something F that he/she can't say well and says A, it's not a parallel EXPLICATION of course because it's "not well said"!
　　So the FA that RECOGNITIONed by the person who heard it is of course not F
　　Stop RECOGNITION there.

　　Focus only on the phenomenon of "the other person said A."
　I understand why the rule is "don't change the words the speaker used."
　　Using the word A used by the other party can point to F, even if the word came from a non-parallel process
　　　I don't know what that F is, but it's not a practical problem.
　　And asking a question to it F generates a CIRCUMLOCUTION
　　　CIRCUMLOCUTION is the creation of RELEVANCE between experienced meaning
　　　F becomes clearer as RELEVANCE increases.

　Keichobot's behavior can now be explained without attributing it to "that's the rule with clean language"!
