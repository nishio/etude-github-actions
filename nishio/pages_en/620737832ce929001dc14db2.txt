To be concerned about the notoriety of others is a sign of stigmatization. Some people want to hide their own stigma with the stigma of others, or at least wash it away. Or some seek solace in it. It is the comfort of fools. Those who form the sewer of scandal around town must have bad breath. The more one broods over these issues, the more one defiles oneself. Few people are without blemishes, but it is the case of those whose blemishes are not well known. Then be careful not to be a record keeper of your faults. It is an abomination to be a person who lives without a heart.
