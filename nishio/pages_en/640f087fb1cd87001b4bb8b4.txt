Keichobot automatic summarization function
I added a function that automatically returns a summary when the chat logs become too large, so I chatted with them to test it out.

memo
ã€€As for the first summary, it wasn't triggered by a bug, so I fixed the condition in the process.
ã€€The OpenAI API's latency has caused the Heroku side to time out and die many times, making it hard to make it practical.
ã€€I feel it would be beneficial to get a summary and next action back to me at the appropriate time in the chat.

log
[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation? (GPT)
[/nishio/human.icon]We have added a function that automatically returns a summary when the chat logs become too large, so let's chat about it as we test it!
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is it a conversation log or another kind of log?
[/nishio/human.icon]Here is the log of this conversation.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is the conversation log you own the log of this chat? Or is it something else?
[/nishio/human.icon]That question is subtle.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is it this chat log you are talking about this time? Is it another kind of log?
[/nishio/human.icon]The original algorithm prevents certain types of questions from being repeated. This means that if a subtle question is asked, if you go through with it, it will not come up again. However, if you use ChatGPT, it will come up again and again.
[/nishio/kei.icon]So, can you tell us a little more about your thoughts on this "sensitive question"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Even human counselors can ask subtle questions. That's because they are agnostic about the client's inner world. ChatGPT repeats itself. This repetition is the most frustrating behavior for clients using the ChatGPT version of Keichobot.
[ChatGPT is a natural language processing model developed by OpenAI and used for artificial intelligence dialogue generation.
[/nishio/human.icon]Next is this, where you don't ask questions, you give explanations.
[/nishio/kei.icon]ChatGPT is a natural language processing model used for artificial intelligence dialogue generation; in the case of Keichobot, this repetition may be considered offensive to the client.
[/nishio/human.icon]Keichobot's Japanese was a little awkward at times, but his ability as a counselor is better than ChatGPT so far. I hope we can merge them well.
[/nishio/kei.icon]How did you hear about ChatGPT?
[/nishio/human.icon]Forgot
[/nishio/kei.icon]ChatGPT is an open source natural language processing model available on the Internet, and Keichobot is one application.
[/nishio/human.icon]If we keep doing what we're doing, we're going to have to reduce the ChatGPT weighting, right?
[/nishio/kei.icon]ChatGPT is an open source natural language processing model available on the Internet, on GitHub and other developer platforms.
[/nishio/human.icon]By the way, we also added a conversation function to the Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector!
[/nishio/kei.icon]You mentioned that you have added a conversation feature to the Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector.
[/nishio/human.icon]ðŸ‘ŽChatGPT
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is the Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector a tool that makes ChatGPT available on Scrapbox? Or is it something else?
[/nishio/human.icon]This is a tool for ChatGPT to have a conversation with reference to Scrapbox data. In the future, it would be preferable to run on Scrapbox, but it hasn't been implemented yet.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector is a tool that allows ChatGPT to have conversations using Scrapbox data, but what are these conversations?
[/nishio/human.icon]Don't think it's a mixed bag.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What type of bot is "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]This bot encourages verbalization by asking questions
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of question?
[/nishio/human.icon]The original Keichobot behaves according to a coaching method called Clean Language
[/nishio/kei.icon]Keichobot is a bot that behaves according to a coaching method and can organize the words of others and approach their inner world through questions.
[/nishio/human.icon]So
[/nishio/kei.icon]Keichobot is a question-answering bot that runs on a program and follows a coaching methodology.
[/nishio/human.icon]Yes!
[/nishio/kei.icon]What types of questions was Keichobot designed to ask?
[/nishio/human.icon]The questions that take out the human mindscape without distorting it are
[/nishio/kei.icon]Can you elaborate a bit more on the concept you mentioned of "taking out the human mindscape without distorting it"?
[/nishio/human.icon]When a question contains an implicit assumption, the person answering is influenced by it and gives a distorted answer. This is very bad, because the respondent may misinterpret it as his/her own idea without realizing that it has been distorted by the question. Therefore, it is necessary to have a technique to extract the information without distorting it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Can you give a more specific example of the concept you described of "a distorted answer if the question contains implicit assumptions"?
[/nishio/human.icon]For example, "Is it A or B?" I would answer with A or B, even if it is really C.
[/nishio/kei.icon] What is the "C" in regards to?
[/nishio/human.icon]For example, when asked whether it is OK or NG, there is a misconception that one has to decide "now" which is which, but in reality, the decision can be postponed.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What type of "misunderstanding" did you describe? Could you please explain in detail?
[/nishio/human.icon]A misconception that makes people think there are only two choices when really there are more.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is it important to you to have choices? Do you feel it is of any value?
[/nishio/human.icon]Having options is important. It is valuable. If you have too many, you won't be able to decide, but until you do, you should have as many as possible.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What does it mean to you to have choices? Can you be more specific?
[/nishio/human.icon]Hmmm, tough question.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What is important to you about "choice"?
[/nishio/human.icon]I guess I feel like I made my own decision.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What are your feelings about the feeling of "self-determination"?
[/nishio/human.icon]When a person succeeds after making his or her own decisions, it makes him or her feel successful, which increases self-affirmation. Conversely, a child who takes the college entrance exam as told by his or her parents and passes the exam may go crazy because he or she does not have a sense of self-affirmation.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of self is "you"?
[/nishio/human.icon]The self that proactively chooses its own life
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about "self" that you feel is important?
[/nishio/human.icon]When you die, you will be able to say, "I have lived my life proactively. It is easy to understand if you consider the opposite extreme. If you say, "I have only followed my parents' orders all my life," you will feel like a robot.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What exactly is the "bot" you are talking about?
[/nishio/human.icon]A being that can only move according to orders.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What exactly is an "order" like?
[/nishio/human.icon]Depriving people of the opportunity for independent decision-making
[/nishio/kei.icon]What exactly do you mean by "decision making" when you state "taking away the opportunity for independent decision making"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Decide for yourself what actions you will take.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where do you come from regarding the "self" that you described as "deciding for yourself what actions you will take"?
[/nishio/human.icons]exist when you realize it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Can you tell us a little more about "chi"?
[/nishio/human.icon]When you are aware of your existence, you already exist.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Who exactly do you mean by "yourself"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Human beings in general, not referring to a specific person here
[/nishio/kei.icon]What exactly are the "choices" regarding?
[/nishio/human.icon]its human behavior options
[/nishio/kei.icon]How do you know what that option is?
[/nishio/human.icon]Sometimes they happen to know, and sometimes they actively take action to know. Back to the story, depending on how the question is asked, it can encourage the discovery of alternatives or, conversely, make them invisible, so a questioner without malicious intent is beneficial
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you think is the best way for that person to find options for action?
[/nishio/human.icon]Basically, I'd prefer more information-gathering behavior.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What types of "actions" can the person take to discover behavioral options?
[/nishio/human.icon]For example, attending events, meeting new people, going to schools and other places to gain new knowledge, joining new communities
[/nishio/kei.icon]Another way to increase your options for action is to increase your output. This includes writing down your thoughts and talking about them.
[/nishio/human.icon]Yes.
[/nishio/kei.icon]It is desirable that the person discovers more options for action.
[/nishio/human.icon]Yes!
[/nishio/kei.icon]What exactly do you mean by "action"?
[/nishio/human.icon]What the specific action is depends on the situation. For example, I often consult with Keichobot about development, and in this case, "implementation" is the action. In this case, "implementation" is the action. There are several methods of implementation, or there are several objectives, and I am not sure which one should be prioritized.
[/nishio/kei.icon]"Consulting Keichobot" is an "implementation" action, but where are you actually performing that action?
[/nishio/human.icon]Implementation is done in front of a computer.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Could you be more specific about "implementation"? For example, what kind of programs are you implementing?
[/nishio/human.icon]Sometimes it depends on the Keichobot itself.
How is [/nishio/kei.icon]Keichobot actually developed?
[/nishio/human.icon]I'm running it on heroku now.
[/nishio/kei.icon]How did you gather information to learn about Keichobot?

[Next action.
- Make it work on Scrapbox.
The [/nishio/human.icon] summary function worked. And you were talking about getting the Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector to work on Scrapbox.
Can you tell us what [/nishio/kei.icon]Scrapbox is all about?
[/nishio/human.icon]Very easy to use, a mechanism to store knowledge
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you need to know about that behavior?
[/nishio/human.icon]ï¼Ÿ
[/nishio/kei.icon]What needs to be improved regarding "Keichobot itself"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Right now we are in the process of exploring the direction of combining Keichobot and GPT. If we decide to make a full-fledged transition, I think it would be better to take this opportunity to rebuild many of the existing algorithms that we don't need.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you think needs to be improved about "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Regarding the areas where we are doing our own machine learning, I think it would be better to leave it to LLM.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Can you elaborate on what you can do?
[/nishio/human.icon]Keywords are scored using machine learning to determine which questions they are appropriate for. Replace there.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of output would you like to see emerge from these "questions"?
[/nishio/human.icon]It is good when users speak with enthusiasm. This enthusiasm judgment is now also machine learning on its own.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of enthusiasm would you like to see as your desired output?
[/nishio/human.icon]It is desirable to get the user into a state of immersion and a lot of talking. New discoveries can be made from what is said in this way.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Regarding [question], what kind of enthusiasm would you like to see as your desired output?
[/nishio/human.icon]It would be nice to have a situation where words start pouring out in response to questions being asked, and more and more verbalization occurs without the user having to work hard.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Who exactly do you mean by "users"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Me first, then anyone who is interested and wants to use it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of program is "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]A program that encourages such people to go further and further ahead by asking them questions and encouraging them to verbalize their Next Actions.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Can you explain exactly how you would pose the question?
[/nishio/human.icon]Right now I'm throwing the whole mess to LLM, but it's not very good, so it'll be like breaking it down into steps and running it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]If Keichobot is executed in steps, what exactly are the steps?
[/nishio/human.icon]That's not enough experimentation yet, and it's hard to try it while messing with a system running on a server, better to create an experimental environment with local scripts.
What was the purpose of [/nishio/kei.icon]Keichobot?
[/nishio/human.icon]The effect of encouraging the verbalization of clean language is very impressive, but it is too expensive to make an appointment with a human for coaching, so it is worthwhile to allow a machine to do it, even if it is somewhat less capable than a human
[/nishio/kei.icon]What exactly do you mean by "verbalization"?
[/nishio/human.icon]To be able to put into words and explain things that I cannot yet explain well.
[/nishio/kei.icon]To begin with, who is Keichobot?
[/nishio/human.icon]It would be digital stationery.
[/nishio/kei.icon]The relationship between this "Keichobot" and "questions" is that Keichobot poses questions to users, encouraging them to deepen and verbalize their own thoughts.
[/nishio/human.icon]Yes.
[/nishio/kei.icon]How do you expect "users" to change with "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]If you cannot verbalize your thoughts, you cannot look over them. By verbalizing your thoughts, you will be able to examine them critically and find a solution to what you are struggling with in contradiction, and verbalization is one step in this process.
[/nishio/kei.icon]It would be nice if "users" could deepen their own thoughts and verbalize them, so that they can examine them more critically and find solutions to contradictory problems.
[/nishio/human.icon]If you can verbalize it, others and your future self can read it. Ideas in your brain disappear quickly.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What specifically do you expect to happen to "you"?
[/nishio/human.icon]I'm hoping that awareness will happen.
[/nishio/kei.icon] "You can say that after the verbalization occurs, you will have a clearer idea of what is important to you, but do you expect it to lead to any specific actions?"
[/nishio/human.icon]Clarity about what is important changes the priorities for resource allocation, which allows those resources to be allocated to actions that were not previously allocated mindshare, time or money, and start moving
[/nishio/kei.icon]What specific "actions" do you take after realizing "what is important"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Actions are created to realize what we think is important.
[/nishio/kei.icon]We hope that these actions will lead to concrete steps to solve problems and issues.
[/nishio/human.icon]So
[/nishio/kei.icon]Do you think that this verbalization can be more useful for others and your future self than for yourself?
[/nishio/human.icon]Of course I think there is.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is this self the conscious self that exists in the brain? Or is it a physical self?
[/nishio/human.icon]A curious question. Consciousness alone would not be able to act, so in the sense that it is the subject that acts, it is the physical self. It could be said that the physical self acts according to a course of action verbalized by the conscious self.
[/nishio/kei.icon]It can be thought of as a movement that is created when verbalization leads to action, changing the priorities of resource allocation and allocating resources to actions that have not been previously allocated.
[/nishio/human.icon]Yes!
[/nishio/kei.icon]As verbalization leads to action, the priorities for resource allocation will change and resources will be allocated to actions that have not been allocated before, creating a movement that is eagerly awaited.
[/nishio/human.icon]Yes, ask any questions.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Verbalization allows you to clearly understand your thoughts and feelings and thereby grasp the values and goals you hold dear.
[/nishio/human.icon]Ask a question.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What does "verbalization" mean to you, as it is very useful for a clear understanding of your inner world?
[/nishio/human.icon]If you have a clear understanding of your inner self, you can live better
[/nishio/kei.icon]The "self" refers to the self as a being that understands its own inner life and values to lead a better life.
[/nishio/human.icon]Good summary.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Do you think there is a connection with Keichobot, a clean language designed to provide choices?
[/nishio/human.icon]Clean language is not designed to provide choice.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Are the "choices" drawn from your self-narrative?
[/nishio/human.icon]Yes.
[/nishio/kei.icon]So what do you think is the purpose designed about Clean Language?
[/nishio/human.icon]It's about bringing out the [/nishio/human.icon
[/nishio/kei.icon] The purpose of "clean language" is to perceive the information to be explained.
[/nishio/human.icon]Hmmm, well, yes. I would say the goal is to make it clearly perceived so that the client can explain his/her feelings and thoughts to others. Maybe the related symbolic modeling is clearer about the idea there.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of people do you mean by "others"?
[/nishio/human.icon]People other than yourself
[/nishio/kei.icon]What characteristics does he/she have?
[/nishio/human.icon]You can't know what's in your heart without describing it in words.
[/nishio/kei.icon] What do you mean by "word"?
The limits of ChatGPT memory. Summary so far
- The chit-chat evolves from the topic of testing a chatbot with the ability to automatically return a summary of chat logs.
- Asking the right questions can put the inner human being into words.
- The importance of enabling clients to explain their own feelings and thoughts to others in words was raised as an objective to make them perceive them clearly.
- Clean Language is not intended to provide choices, but it does play a role in the related symbolic modeling.
- Keichobot and ChatGPT must be combined, starting with experiments in local environments.
- FUTURE WORK: Development of a combination of Keichobot and ChatGPT will be promoted.
