Embedded Hiragana and Katakana
[https://gyazo.com/b4e5c4b7070cc735f798cdca0c1969a9]
This is what I got when I embedded the correspondence between hiragana and katakana (6 dimensions: hiragana/katakana, line, dan, voiced, half voiced, lower case) in 2 dimensions using [t-SNE].

The strange bending is simply due to the t-SNE, which seems obvious when linearly reduced in dimensionality by [PCA].

The next day, 2018-12-01, the rows and columns were [rotated encoding] and the long vowel symbol was added, making it 10-dimensional.
