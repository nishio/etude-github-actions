 Thoughts.
 　AiBi is a common multiple of Ai, the same regardless of i
 　AiBi divided by Ai is Bi
 　So mathematically, the answer is to find the least common multiple, divide by each Ai, and multiply
 　There are 10^4 N values of 10^6 order A, so a naive calculation would be very difficult.
 　Least common multiple is all Ai multiplied by the greatest common divisor
 　Find the greatest common divisor first
 　　This is only 10^4 times log(10^6) order of magnitude more than enough to calculate O(N log A)
 　Find [the inverse element in mod P] to divide by the greatest common divisor
 　　Since it is the inverse of a single number, it can be obtained in about log(mod).
 　Since division by Ai only cancels one product from all Ai products, it is a [product except one] and can be obtained by [cumulative product from left to right].
 　　Linear order preprocessing, this process is constant order
 　Add them together and you have the answer.
　Official Explanation
　　The considerations are the same up to the point of least common multiple.
　　Then trying to find the least common multiple with prime factorization
　　Prime factorization is on the order of the square root, 10^3, and we do it 10^4 times, so 10^7, in time.
　　Talk about O(A+NlogA) by speeding up the prime factorization through preprocessing.
　　　[Fast Prime Factorization], where the O(A) table is pre-built so that no trial division is required and the prime factorization is of logarithmic order.
　　　Is this as much of an order of magnitude as my solution after all this time?
