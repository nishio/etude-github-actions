information card
A piece of paper for writing information.
In Japan, it is often referred to as "Kyodai-style cards" introduced by Tadao Umesao in his "The Art of Intellectual Production" in 1969.
Tadao Umesao calls it [Kyoto University type card].

Kyo large cards are B6 size (182mm x 128mm)
>Small cards are just a "memo" and can't be used in place of a full-fledged notebook.
	Technology of Intellectual Production p. 50
	In other words, it's implicitly supposed to be used as a replacement for a full-fledged notebook.
 	I assume you mean "a means of [stocking] information."
		This was in 1969; now in 2018, it's "information stock should be electronic and searchable."
	 Related: [Scrapbox is a notebook].

In addition to these information cards, Umesao uses a B8 size paper called "[kozane]". This one is not stocked and used up.
>When the work is done, the kozane is no longer needed. Just roll it up and throw it away. (p.205)
