Moleskin period
[https://gyazo.com/616fda27a67c8b77482d4174ecb617ca]
	When I used to use [Moleskine] as a [notebook].
 I got married in [2011-07] and started using it because my wife said, "An intellectual worker [should] not be stingy with stationery."
	Q: What size is it?
 	A: A4 square ([Moleskine Folio Squared Notebook: A4 https://www.amazon.co.uk/Moleskine-Folio-Squared-Notebook-Srl/dp/8862932421])

	(Looking at up to note 6) Huh? I was under the understanding that you stopped using it because you bought an [iPad Pro] and started taking notes there, but that was March 2018, right? What did you do during that time?
		I had completely forgotten about Note 7, which was in a different location after being used.

Also, I was under the impression that you were taking class notes at Tokyo Tech in a Moleskine, but only in the latter half of the period.
