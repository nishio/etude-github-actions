Splitting links that are too large
The [too large link problem] is a problem that inevitably occurs when the number of pages in Scrapbox increases.

Consider an algorithm to split links that are too large.
	[Narrow down your search by crossing keywords.]
	　Easy to implement
	　The link names that are created are mechanical and [tasteless].
	[Splitting links that are too large through hierarchical clustering]
	　Split into multiple groups
	　What name to give it is delicate.
	Proposal to grow keywords by involving surrounding words.
	　It will be the most human-friendly link name.

Links that are too large are complete graphs
	The problem that inevitably arises when the number of pages to consider an algorithm for partitioning this complete graph increases

What will be the index for optimization then?
	Not to minimize the increase in distance.
		because if short distance is good, it is best to make all pages the same tag and all complete graphs with distance 1
		We need to make divisions so that what should be near is near and what should be far away is far away.
