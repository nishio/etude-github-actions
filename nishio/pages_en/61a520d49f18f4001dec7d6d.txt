What resources are needed to accomplish this?
When you want to [achieve] something, what do you need [money], [time], [knowledge], or [labor]? This should be clear.
Some resources can be converted from another, but the conversion efficiency is not always good. So, if you acquire an inappropriate resource (by spending time or money) and then realize that the appropriate one is something else, you will lose money, or worse than that, you will not be able to make a rational decision due to "[the psychology of] wanting to avoid loss.
