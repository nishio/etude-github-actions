 ** Study on 6/29
 8d test 14 sheets OK 14.
 
 ** 6/30 Study
 Tested 12 cards OK 9 NG 3. 2d test 14 cards OK 9 NG 5. Added more words considering that the word study test was starting to go well and that too few cards was not interesting. 31 cards.
 
 Study **7/1
 Friday, I am not at home for the weekend due to a paid holiday for business. But I was able to carry out my English studies, which gives me the feeling that I have made more progress than I did a month ago.
 
 But then again, I forgot to bring back the review word cards as I did last week... Well, let's make it a goal not to forget the review cards next weekend.
 
 Tested 31 cards on the train OK 23 NG 8. As it is, I only have 8 cards to test tomorrow, so I added 35 words using the skim time I have while waiting for the plane to take off or waiting for food at a restaurant. I don't have time to look them up in an English-English dictionary, so I'm mostly transcribing from a list, so the percentage of correct answers tomorrow won't be high.
 
 ** 7/2 study
 Tested 43 sheets, OK 26 NG 17. Well, the percentage of correct answers is low.
 
 ** 7/3 study
 Tested 17 sheets, OK 11 NG 6. If you "just tested the day before," roughly 30% will be NG. I'm rather lucky that I can remember 60% of the cards even though I didn't study them seriously and repeat the test. The question is, what is the percentage of correct answers of the cards passed here after, say, 4 or 8 days?
 
 23 2d review test, OK 22 NG 1.
 
 Should I buy a vocabulary book or something to acquire words to memorize soon?

 The ALC recommends this and another difficult one, 4, but I am wondering if I should start with 2, which is easier, or 3, which is more straightforward, in order to strengthen the foundation.
 
 I have about 70 review tests tomorrow, but each one is 5-10 seconds long, so it will probably take me 13 minutes at most. I'm making progress in being able to estimate this kind of time. So, I will have about 12 minutes left over after studying one Pomodoro, so I will use the remaining time to improve the cards whose memory is not clear. I don't really know how long it takes to improve a card. I'm sure it's due to the large variation, but I'm sure I still had enough samples to get an average. I guess my failure is that I didn't keep records.
 
 ** 7/4 study
 7 test OK5NG2. 8d test 16 dated 7/1, OK15NG1. 4d test 28 dated 7/1, OK26NG2. 2d test 26 dated 7/4, OK26.
 9 2d test dated 7/2, OK 7, NG 2. 4d test dated 7/4, OK 7, NG 2.
 
 <a href='http://www.alc.co.jp/eng/vocab/svl/list.html'>Vocabulary list by level SVL12000: Space Alc</a>. Oh, there's a good one. Ah, but it's in Flash. I can't view it from my phone.
 
 ** 7/5 study
 I brought the review test cards home with me to do them on the train on the way there, but forgot to do them.
 Review OK9 NG 1. 2d test OK8 NG3. 8d test OK19 NG 1.
 
 I bought a small ring yesterday, but it took a lot of force to open it, which was a bit of a mistake.
 
 I challenged myself to see how many words I could add in 5 minutes. 7 and a half. about 35 in 25 minutes.
 
 Oh, this is great. I put together a <a href='http://readingmonkey.blog45.fc2.com/blog-entry-413.html'>free English word list Reading Monkey Classic: between / beyond readers</a>.
 
 >|python|
 from DictionaryServices import DCSCopyTextDefinition
 
 fi = file("basicwords.txt")
 words = [[] for level in range(13)]
 for line in fi:
     if not line or line[0] == "#": continue
     items = line.split()
     alc = items[4]
     try:
         alc = int(alc)
     except:
         continue
     word = items[7]
     words[alc].append(word)
 
 for level in range(1, 13):
     fo = open("words%02d.txt" % level, "w")
     for i, w in enumerate(words[level]):
         print >>fo, i, w
         print >>fo, DCSCopyTextDefinition(None, w, (0, len(w))).encode("utf-8")
         print >>fo
 ||<
 
 Some of the lines are not formatted as they should be, and I'm trying to block out the errors, but the number of words obtained per level is [0, 999, 998, 999, 999, 999, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 998, 999, 999, 999], which is approximately all of the words obtained. In the latter part of the output, the New Oxford American Dictionary, which comes with the Mac by default, is used to look up the meaning of the words. The output looks something like this: [1000, 1000, 1000, 998, 999, 999, 999].

 Now I can quickly make word cards even when I'm on the train with no signal. I thought that it would be better to start from the first level of difficulty rather than doing the 12th level. I think I know most of the words, so I can easily go through them, and it's important to have a solid foundation. The simpler and more frequent a word is, the more it is important to paraphrase it in other words to enrich your knowledge network.

 I divided it further into 10 parts because it was a little too big to be a text file of 1000 words each.
 
 The amount of word cards has been increasing (there are about 250 cards already), and I'm starting to worry about how to manage them. I used to "buy more rings" and "keep them in the corner of my desk," but I think it's about to fall apart. I'm worried about it. I'll post some pictures here later.

 I asked id:higepon how he does it and he said "I arrange them by date in a box". He said that he puts them by date in a box. He does not have to sort by date. Instead, he solves the "too many bundles problem" by buffering. Buffering is a method that I introduced in my last article, where I put a bundle after it has accumulated to a certain extent. I decided to buffer until I had accumulated 10 sheets, because I thought "4 sheets in a bundle is too few," but I heard that higepon buffers until he has accumulated about 100 sheets (judged by thickness). In my case, the review intervals start at 2 days, 4 days, 8 days, and I add words as and when I feel like it, so I average about 10 sheets a day? So, introducing that would delay the 2-day test by an average of 10 days... I think I'll buffer 10 for the 2-day test, 25 for the 4-day test, 50 for the 8-day test, and 100 for the 16-day test.
 
 I was looking at the level2 word list and found a meaning I didn't know. This is another phenomenon like offset and exploit, where you learn one meaning, think you know it, and don't pay attention to the rest of the meanings. The word is account, and of course I remember the meaning of account or account, but what does it mean as a verb? Well, I should have at least realized that it is "account+able" since I learned the word "accountability. I guess I should start from the basics.
 
 ** Review and update goals
 - Study on Saturdays and Sundays (though I have to go out!) â†’Achieved!
 - Next Saturday and Sunday, I'll try to remember the review cards.
 - On 7/7 it will be one month since I started this memorization system, so let's do an overall test to see how many words I've learned in one month.
