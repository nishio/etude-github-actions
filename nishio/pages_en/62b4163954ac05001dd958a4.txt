Don't put time pressure on label creation.
The original proposal scheduled 10 minutes for label making, which is not good.

 [From research to creation (Kodansha Gendai Shinsho, 1977)

If the goal is to produce 25 labels in 600 seconds, people will be distracted by the quantity goal of 25 labels and mass produce miscellaneous labels.

If the estimate is that it will take 10 minutes to make, then it would be better to make that 10 minutes as homework in advance. How about, "Please make about 25 labels in advance on a theme of your choice."

There are those who can do as they please when asked to "choose a theme of your choice," and those who cannot. For those who cannot, a tentative theme is also presented.

What would you like to see happen by attending this study group?"
Ask yourself this question and write down the words that come to mind.
It does not have to be a clean sentence. Fragmented keywords are fine.
Words that come up in response to a question may seem unrelated but may have something to do with it, so they are written down.

When nothing comes up in response to the first question, look at what you have written down. Then pick one word and ask yourself, "What is this X like?" and ask yourself, "What is this X like?
For example: .
 Tools that can be used well"â†’What does "well" mean?
 If you go over the wall, you'll like it." - What does that "like" look like?
