Not a good metaphor.
>Most people only have one experience, and that's not a good metaphor. I've seen the metaphor "a company that treats its employees like family is bad." There are families out there that treat their elementary school children as independent individuals, and there are families that treat their adult children like their parents' property, and they've only had one experience.
