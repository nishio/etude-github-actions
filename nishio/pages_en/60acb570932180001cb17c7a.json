Knowledge is a prerequisite for another
If you don't know how linear algebra works, you don't profit from linear algebra; if you don't know how taxes work, you don't notice when you get money when you file for a tax refund and throw money away; if you don't know how the economy works, you lose money on financial instruments that are not good. I guess that's what it means.

And since people without knowledge cannot know "how much they are losing by not having knowledge," they are likely to look at those who are acquiring knowledge and think of others like "why are they working so hard to acquire knowledge? Because it's a gain.
	In the case of "I do it because it's fun, not because it's profit or loss," there is also the benefit of "I can spend time with a good feeling.

Some people say they can't imagine making money with the knowledge of linear algebra, but knowledge is a prerequisite for another kind of knowledge, and the money is made after repeating the process.

If we focus only on linear algebra, it is knowledge that is learned in the first year of undergraduate school, so it is not [rare] and there is no [barrier to entry] to learning it, so there is no way to make money from that knowledge alone. But linear algebra is a prerequisite for neural nets and natural language processing, so the profit from that knowledge cannot be reached without knowledge of linear algebra

If there is a button that says, "If you press this button, you will never learn linear algebra or understand its benefits, but your grandfather will become prime minister," you are more likely to press it, because the knowledge gained in that environment is rare and has a high barrier to entry that others cannot gain even if they wanted to. The knowledge gained in that environment is rare and has a high barrier to entry that other people cannot obtain even if they wanted to.
