iPad term
As for pen-like input devices, [Thnkpad X41 Tablet https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2005/0608/lenovo.htm] (released in 2005) was the first, except for external tablets. However, I did not make much use of it.
I changed from the original iPad to the iPad Air on 2014-01-04 and am trying the stylus because of the increased reaction time.
I started to include [hand-drawn diagrams] in my lecture materials in 2010, and the demand for them was increasing.
	Before the iPad, I used to take pictures of what I drew on [whiteboards] and notepads.
For a while after that, I posted diagrams drawn with the stylus on Facebook, but the slow response time prevented me from making much use of it.

Purchased [iPad Pro] in 2018. It was inspired by accompanying [Jun Kuikei] in his activities and taking classes with [Kazuhiro Shiozawa].
