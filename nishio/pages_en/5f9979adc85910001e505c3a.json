Maximization with bisection search.
	[$ \max_x f(x)] bivariate search for X by making [$ f(x) > X ] a solution existence decision problem satisfying
　Size where x is permutation, subset, etc. not fully searchable
　When a greedy algorithm to find max f(x) cannot be thought of, it is easier to use the existence of solutions that satisfy f(x)>X, since it is not limited to the largest solution.

[Maximize] is [binary search].
