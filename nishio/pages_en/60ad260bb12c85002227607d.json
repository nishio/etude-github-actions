Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem
[Definition of efficiency]
　How can the consequence [$ x \in X] be efficient under the preference pair [$ \succsim \in \mathscr{D}_I ]?
　	[$ y \succsim_i x \quad \forall i \in I]
　	[$ y \succ_j x \quad \exists j \in I]
　is that there is no consequence [$ y ] that satisfies
　　In other words, if any one person can improve without making anyone worse off, that is not efficient.
　[With respect to the [social choice function] [$ f: \mathscr{D}_i \to X ], if the consequence [$ f(\succsim)] is efficient under the preference [$ \succsim \in \mathscr{D}_I ] for all preference pairs [$ f We say that [$ f
