The page has no title.
	But it's [a hub of links], so it's a useful sign
	[titling after the fact].
	[page without title on a dare].
	　This "no title" does not mean "the title is an empty string" but "[the title is not a summary of the content]"

　If you are thinking about something and the keywords A and B come to mind, there must be some kind of connection between the two.
　If this connection is obvious, it will say, "There is this connection between A and B."
　But there are times when it is not clear, and it would be a shame to throw information away because it is not clear.
　So use "I can't think of a useful title, but I'll put it on one page anyway to record that it came to mind together".

　I realized that this is a kind of KJ method "[put something that seems to be related] nearby".
