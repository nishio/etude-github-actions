	I've been doing recording transcription for a while.
	I don't feel much effect.
		Would you lose it? NO
	Why?
	Dialogue is not interesting.
		Where the output is not dialogue but tension and one-sided output.
		would be interesting to read again later.
		At first I thought, "where he's talking about his pet theory," but no.
			Trigger a conversation to come up with something new and interesting
 			→I get excited.
 			→Output one-sidedly
 		Not the original one itself.
 The moment you're excited and talking to yourself is the moment you've caught the big one.
  People are only interested in the fish they catch and the moment they hoist it.
  Few people are interested in the interaction before fishing.

 Why did I take out my notebook? Because I was about to tell a complicated story and I wanted to clear my head.
 Organizations age if left alone.
