地球外少年少女
>[https://twitter.com/ya7ce/status/1565903169418174464 @ya7ce]: I finished the Extraterrestrial Shonen Shoujo, 6 episodes, but it was so fast-paced and always interesting that it was hard to stop, so I watched it in three parts: episodes 1, 2, 3, and 4-6.
>Set in a future where both the artificial intelligence boom and the space boom have once been booming and have now converged, the story is about a boy and a girl who cannot go down to earth because they were born on the moon, sisters who came to the space station as tourists, and a hacker boy who gets involved in an accident on the station and struggles with all sorts of things.
>The gadgets that come out are just fascinating, and it is wonderful that the behavior in zero gravity and the facilities of the station are designed in a way that is not too bound by existing science fiction, but is convincing at first glance, so that you will never get bored just looking at this world.
>In the end, it is a story about artificial intelligence and mankind, which is similar to [Godzilla SP] and [Ghost in the Shell 2045]. They all have similar conclusions. But it is interesting to think that "[AI's genes]" had that point of view earlier and went in a different direction.
