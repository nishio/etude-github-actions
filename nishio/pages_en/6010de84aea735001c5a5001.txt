Setting up pytest in VSCode
I have no idea.
I used to call pytest as a module, not as a command, so I tried to specify the same thing, but I get an error with no details.
code:.vscode/settings.json
 {
   "python.pythonPath": "venv/bin/python",
   "python.testing.pytestPath": "venv/bin/python -m pytest",  // here
   "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
     "tests", "--cov=server", "--cov-report=xml"
   ],
   "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
   "python.testing.nosetestsEnabled": false,
   "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true
 }

Then, I tried to insert a shell script like this, but the result was also not clear
code:bash
 #!/bin/bash
 python -m pytest $* --cov=server --cov-report=xml

[python - Imports break VSCode testing with pytest - Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57273945/imports-break-vscode-testing-with-pytest]
Here's the workaround.
code:tests/__ini__.py
 import sys
 sys.path.insert(0, ".")

So we can now test it with GUI.

I wonder if this is useful?
If only some of the tests are run, of course, the areas not covered by them will "not pass the test" in terms of coverage.
It might be better to bundle the tests for coverage output into a shell script and not output coverage when running the tests from VSCode.
