Building a Tachikoma with LEGO 4
I tried to make again what I made in [Making Tachikoma with LEGO 1] for relaxation because it was too difficult to make Tachikoma's eyeballs in [Making Tachikoma with LEGO 3].
Last time the carrier was just a rectangle, but I bought a lot of curved slopes, so I tried a round carrier.
I made it haphazardly and ended up with a gimmick that wasn't in the original work lol.

I have found that if you have enough [slope curve] and [side studs], you can make it just right and it will look okay.
Before purchasing the parts, it was impossible because there were only paraphernalia of mixed colors.

How [side stud blocks] support [slope curve
