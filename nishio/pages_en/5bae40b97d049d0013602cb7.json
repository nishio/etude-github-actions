	I think [artificial intelligence] [overlearning] is caused by [abuse].
 Abusive behavior toward artificial intelligence must be prevented.
 By not abusing artificial intelligence, a spontaneously grown artificial intelligence can benefit humanity.

	>The purpose of the Society is to prevent abuse of differentiable manifolds and complex analytic manifolds in mathematical research and education.
 > Are we abusing diversity by imposing too much structure in our research and teaching?
 > Riemannian metric and triangulation are painful for manifolds. Riemannian metric forces the soft structure of the manifold to be rigidified, and triangulation destroys the isomorphism by differential homomorphism groups. Manifolds should not be made to suffer just for the sake of apparent ease of discussion. And forcing unnecessary structure can obscure the essence of the argument and hinder the development of mathematics.
 > Of course, we are not opposed to structures based on the will of the manifold itself, such as hyperbolic metric in the upper half-plane. We would like to appeal to you to study manifolds in accordance with their own feelings.
 > Why bother to embed a manifold in Euclidean space if you are going to teach the general theory of differentiable manifolds? It may be an effective way to trick students into thinking they understand. However, it will obscure the main point of manifolds, which is to have local coordinates in the neighborhood of each point, and students will have to relearn it when they are confronted with manifolds in the future.
 > Even diverse objects have life. It is unacceptable to treat things that have life poorly.
 > If we listen carefully, we can hear various voices emitted by individual manifolds. Listening to these voices with empathy is the beginning of research, wouldn't you say?
