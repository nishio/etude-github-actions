Chop up the presentation material.
I think an hour's worth of presentation material is a big page for Scrapbox.
　In terms of characters, that's about 10,000.
　There are a number of "newly created diagrams"
　　It's a shame that this doesn't show up in the thumbnails.
　　Frankly, it's too much of a waste that a picture that I used my very brain and even went back to the original book to revise the inconsistencies and finally convinced myself in version 3 is not in the thumbnail, but it's not an appropriate thumbnail for the page itself.
　　　This means that [a page with many different things on it cannot have a fitting title].

But what happens when you simply chop it up?
　You'd be throwing away the "[one-dimensionality]" connection that you went to the trouble of creating.
　　This is another waste of time.

What should we do?
　Like this?

It's been a while since I wrote the idea of
　Why not do it right away?
　They feel that by doing this they are losing something, and this is preventing them from doing it.

Then do both.
　Duplicate X
　Split X
　Rename X(copy) to X
