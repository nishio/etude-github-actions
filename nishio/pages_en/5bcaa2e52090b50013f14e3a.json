Gilles Deleuze.
>Différence et répétition (French: Différence and Repetition) is a study of philosophy published by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze in 1968.
> In this book, Deleuze focuses on the problem of identity. For example, in the statement "Socrates is a man," Deleuze describes a situation in which what is used exclusively to refer to Socrates, an individual and concrete historical figure, is equal to what is commonly used to refer to human beings, beings with various differences.
> Regarding [identity], David [Hume] asked whether and how we can derive what is generally true from individual experience. This book addresses this question of identity by examining [how a wide variety of supposedly identical beings can be regarded as identical], and clarifies the [differential] nature and its [repetitive] process that cannot be handled by identity.
> Deleuze points out that the successive sequence "ABABAB..." is recognized as a repetition of "AB," and argues that such recognition is due to the imagination of the perceiver, not to the essence of the object of recognition. He also believes that such recognition of identity is not a conscious action of the mind, since it arises from the [passive synthesis] of the perceiver. First, in a realm outside the action of the mind, the perceiver's past [experience] is "[virginal repetition]" in the present. This idealizes and [condenses] a being that had no identity in its own right. Deleuze thus argues for a reassessment of the identity of the activity of philosophy in light of the fact that the identity of any being is thus determined by experiences acquired in the past and their passive synthesis, their virginal repetition. The fact that existence is defined by the past is a continuous event in the future, and the past prepares another repetition in the present and thus becomes the condition for action in the future. Deleuze argues that in order to break free from this, we can orient ourselves to a new way of being by finding a past that has never been repeated.
