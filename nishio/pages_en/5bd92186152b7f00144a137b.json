I'll do it when I'm good at it.
Because people [become good at what they repeat],
Someone who says, "I'll do it when I get good at it," and doesn't do it, will never get good at it.
People who say, "I'm not good at this, but I'm going to do it because [I want to]," will be good at it.


Do we need "because we want to?"
Those who say, "I'm not good at this, but I'll do it because [I should]," are likely to lose heart before they repeat themselves enough.
