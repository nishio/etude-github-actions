Binary Search Checklist
[https://gyazo.com/3adb1ed9f7f843ada150d675bffb61a3]
Check the four components of a [binary search
　1: Is f(x) correct?
　　I can't help it if I'm wrong here.
　　You should write down some patterns and check them out.
　2: Does a large/small comparison involve an equal sign?
　　Depends on whether you choose left or right when there is no matching value.

　　If it matches, that's it, if not, if we choose left, we need to search for f(x)=T and f(x)<T to be left, and then return left.
　　In [abc174]E it was necessary to return right in reverse
　　Some type of problem where 1 and 2 can't be separated.
　　　In that case, 1 becomes an implementation that returns bool.
　3: Is the initial value of left appropriate?
　　Check whether the initial value satisfies the inequality to be satisfied by LEFT based on 2.
　4: Is the initial value of right appropriate?

code:python
 def solve(N, K, AS):
     left = 0  # (3)
     right = max(AS)  # (4)
 
     while left < right - 1:
         x = (left + right) // 2
         y = f(x)  # (1)
         if y > K:  # (2)
             left = x
         else:
             right = x
     return right
