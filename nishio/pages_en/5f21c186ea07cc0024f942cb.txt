Viterbi algorithm
>The Viterbi algorithm is a type of dynamic programming algorithm that searches for the most plausible sequence of hidden states (called a Viterbi path) resulting from an observed sequence of events.

Used in [hidden Markov models], but not exclusively
Given a DAG, find the path that maximizes the score type [dynamic programming].
