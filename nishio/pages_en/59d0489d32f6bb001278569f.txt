Example of finding information in episodic memory
	I remember "Dr. Masui wrote a program in JavaScript in Scrapbox," and I want to find it.
 But I don't know what keywords to search for on Google.
 I recall an episodic memory: "When I learned about it, you were collecting mathematical wonders."
 I don't know what the title of that page is.
 I recall, "I believe I wrote a story about [Efron's dice] on that page."
 Search for `Efron`. You can find more than one.
 I found a link to the page I was looking for [/prog-exercises/generate-normal-distribution] in [Unexpected Phenomena
 Side note: There was a confusion between "Efron's dice" and "Efron's dice", so I tagged them both.
