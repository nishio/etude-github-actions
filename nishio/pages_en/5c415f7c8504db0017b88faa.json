Twist of the plan proposal
	A and S = {A, B, C} with A as an element.
	From the perspective of which to take as a planning proposal, A and S are mutually exclusive options, so the bullet points are siblings.
	As for the structure of information, S is a concept that includes A, so S is the parent and A is the child
	If you write A and then come up with S as a generalization of it, A is the context in which you come up with S, so A is the parent and S is the child
	It is difficult to express such things using only the [hierarchical structure] of [tree].
	There are solutions to link between the leaves of the tree.
