	Notes on rereading three chapters of Methodology of Creation
 Hypothesis testing is the act of examining the differences between the image in one's mind and the real world.
 CONCEPT is a condensed version of the human experience
 Human beings use the concept as a searchlight to illuminate the world and read the facts (what is not illuminated is not recognized as a fact).
 The modification and creation of concepts is the intellectual creation of human beings.
 A concept is a more generalized and broadly applicable version of a "picture in your head.
 In research, a concept is a general definition, and to observe it in reality, it is necessary to reduce it to an index that can be observed as actual data.
 Hypothesis testing is performed by reducing an abstract concept into a concrete hypothesis.
