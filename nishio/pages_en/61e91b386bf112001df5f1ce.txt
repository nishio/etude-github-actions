I add the concept during I'm writing the English version. (2019-03-13)

 [(4.4.2.2) Read to make a note]

It is [Neo-Whorfian hypothesis]:

>We offer the following hypothesis, which is related to the Whorfian hypothesis: Both the language used by a culture, and the capability for effective intellectual activity are directly affected during their evolution by the means by which individuals control the external manipulation of symbols. (For identification, we will refer to this as the [Neo-Whorfian hypothesis].)
