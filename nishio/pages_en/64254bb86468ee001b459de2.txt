White-collar is a slow computer

[White collar] is a slow computer.
Talk about AI replacing mainly white collar and not blue collar.
　Because white-collar workers were trained and turned into computers at a time when there were no computers.

Japanese idiom "[Tegoku]" ("a job in hand").

A surplus is created for white-collar workers who do not have a job in hand.
　I guess I'll just have to move to a blue collar job.
　The argument is that even if they change jobs, they will be treated badly because they are "inexperienced, low-skilled newcomers".

Some "white-collar workers who [look down] on blue-collar workers" will not lose their jobs, but they will [suffer] because they cannot accept the reality that they have to quit their white-collar jobs and start over as unskilled blue-collar workers.
　I deserve it because the poison of "condescension" only comes back to haunt me.

When we say "[AI will take jobs]," we subconsciously exclude blue-collar workers from the concept of what the word "job" refers to.
　Implicitly assuming that "it's not my job to do it."
　　This is condescension.
　You are narrowing your own possibilities.

The term "white collar" here is also low resolution because it was coined a long time ago.
　In the future, we need to think in more detail and with higher resolution.
　There are white-collar workers who will be replaced by AI and those who will not.
　Drucker's [knowledge worker] concept needs to be revisited and fleshed out further
　　Simply put, white-collar workers who are not knowledge workers are easier to replace with AI.
