Good note-taking misses the point; what matters is good thinking.

	"Better Note-taking" misses the point, the key is "better thinking."
	Many people have written about solutions to the problem that note-taking habits are generally ineffective.
	Most of it in a short-sighted, "life-hack" frame of mind,
	It is written with a focus on answering the following questions
		How do I organize my notes?"
		What kind of journal should I use?"
		How can I easily keep track of the bits and pieces of books I read?"
	The answers to these questions are unsatisfactory because the questions focus on the wrong things.
		The goal is not to take notes, but to think effectively.
		A better question is.
			What kind of exercises can we do to ensure that we gain insight over time?"
			How can I effectively direct my attention?"
		This is the frame in which evergreen note writing, the basic unit of knowledge work, makes sense.
		Evergreen note writing helps accumulate insights.
	Technically, it is not about "computer-supported note-taking" but "computer-supported thinking."
		This is because "note-taking" is the visible element of an invisible habit.
		If you see insightful people writing in notebooks, you might imagine that if you get the right notebooks and organize them well, you too can gain insight.
		And of course, note taking is visible.
		It's relatively easy and [makes me feel like I'm doing something even if it's useless] (note-taking habit gives weak feedback)
			[nishio.icon][ritualization].
		So it is a fascinating nuisance.
	Those who write extensively about note-taking rarely have any serious context for its use.
