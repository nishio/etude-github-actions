Guerrilla warfare between superiors and bottoms up
  Chatwork seems to be aiming for that, but it is still too much of a "superintelligent" tool. As a member of Chatwork, I am slowly feeling a sense of frustration. I wonder how we can achieve both.
  [nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/915798554769108992] At least within Cybozu, "[groupware]" is the tool that makes it happen, but I guess it's a matter of how customers use it.
   [tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/915800109509574657] Cybozu has historically been introduced by [middle managers] who bought licenses for what they could settle for, so it seems to be oriented toward the middle [Laughs] I think it's more of a middle man. I get the sense that it's more like a solution to PM overwork.

	[tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/915771993030410240] When I wrote various things on the internal SNS of a telephone company, my boss called me up and got angry with me. At a game company that had created an internal blog, I wrote whatever I wanted on the internal blog. I was called in by my boss and was scolded if I wrote anything I wanted on the company blog at a game company. Now I understand why. In-house SNS and in-house blogs were introduced for the purpose of superiors, so they were used for purposes other than what they were intended for.
  [tokoroten https://twitter.com/tokoroten/status/915769666148081664]There are those who say "communication = problem solving" and those who say "communication = political power, interest alignment, mind control, and control. There are two types of people. The latter group makes the decision to introduce internal tools, so things like internal SNSs and other incomprehensible things are introduced, and the company becomes underdeveloped. Then, Slack and others start guerrilla warfare.
   [nishio.icon] The metaphor of "guerrilla warfare" is useful see [guerrilla warfare].
   [ajiyoshi https://twitter.com/ajiyoshi/status/915802081243435009] slack has an exquisite setup of free and paid plans, and it's designed exactly for people to start using it guerrilla-style in the field. By the time you want to request an approval to move to a paid plan, there are already a lot of users.

	History
  My historical understanding is that Cybozu had the ability to add comments to the "bulletin board" at the time of its early Office releases. This was a bottom-up [electronic bulletin board] usage as a place for [communication]. However, later, at the request of customers, an option was added to "prohibit comments on the bulletin board. This is a supercilious usage.
  There was a time when "[BBS](electronic bulletin board system)" was used for communication on the Internet, though young people today may not know it.
   >In the early 1990s, electronic bulletin boards were one of the major services of personal computer communications, which were in full swing before the Internet became popular.
    [Electronic bulletin board - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9B%BB%E5%AD%90%E6%8E%B2%E7%A4%BA%E6%9D%BF]
   Cybozu [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%9C%E3%82%A6%E3%82%BA] was founded in 1997. It was a natural idea to use BBS, which was already widely used on the Internet at that time, for internal communication.
   However, it is also natural, well, given the circumstances of the time, that some customers considered a "bulletin board" to be "a piece of paper posted on a wall" and wanted to prevent comments from being written on the board.

  For people of a certain age, communication is "an output to convey information to a specific person" (the image of dialogue or e-mail), whereas "an output for sharing information or externalizing thoughts without a specific person in mind" (the image of [Web diary], [blog], and [Twitter]) has become widespread. (the image of [one's own words] or a diary).
   [Web diary - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98]
   [Blog - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0]
   [Twitter - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter]
  In-house SNS was born from the idea of bringing the communication taking place on SNS into the company, but it is a prerequisite for a "culture in which it is good for each individual to transmit information" to function as individuals on SNS do.
  Cybozu's [kintone] now comes with a (Twitter-like) one-to-one place for all members by default. The bottom-up information transmission function from employees is incorporated into the tool because they feel the need to use it, and they are actually using it to the fullest. From the standpoint of those who use it to the fullest, "cases of beneficial communication within the company triggered by individual one-on-one conversations" happen every day and cannot be counted (like, "Do you remember how many loaves of bread you've eaten so far? You can't even count them all (do you remember how many loaves of bread you've eaten?)
