　I feel that as A increases, B increases, but I couldn't figure out why exactly A would increase B.
　This was a combination of [implicit resource] and [stochastic change
　Doing A increases the implicit resource R
　A state P changes stochastically to B
　The more resource R, the higher the probability of
