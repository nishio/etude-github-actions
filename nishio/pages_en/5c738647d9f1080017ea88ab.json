Trial and error is hard to see.
>If we compare it to a box, the trial and error are lined up in the depth direction. From the front, you can only see the box of the method that ultimately succeeded. You may look at someone else's activity and think, "How did he come up with this way of doing things, I would never have thought of that, maybe he is a genius. That is because you only see the frontmost box, and you feel that way.

Depth direction is difficult to observe, so it is easy to mistake it as if it were not there
Seems to make sense from someone who's actually done the trial and error.
