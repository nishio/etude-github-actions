It is useful to recognize variables as "probability distributions" that can take on multiple values, rather than a single value.

	Humans tend to overlook higher moments
		Forget about variance and think only in terms of averages.
			[50% chance of achievement even if achieved on average].
			[not a natural occurrence of disparity].
		Forgetting moments of higher order than variance.
			[Mean, mode, and median do not necessarily coincide
