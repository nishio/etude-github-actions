Turning "I can" into "I want to
	The phenomenon that what one thinks "[can do]" becomes "[want to do].
 Children are easily made to feel inferior by being physically outmatched by the adults around them #Adlerian psychology
 There is a self-image of being perceived as "incapable" by those around you.
 This is where the desire to be appreciated by those around you arises by actually doing what you say you can do.
 Desire for growth, desire to expand self

 Contrary to trying to develop skills to be able to do what you want to do.
 I just want to do what I think I can do and be appreciated.
 So, if it seems more difficult than you think, you lose motivation to do it.
 Because other "do-able" things seem easier.
