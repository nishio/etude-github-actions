 I think "things that are originally written in fragmented form" like the Pensees and the Book of Proverbs would be more valuable if they were networked in Scrapbox.
 　I think, but I don't want to transcribe the book's contents to the public Scrapbox.
 　I was thinking that, but then I realized that there is an English translation on the net that is out of copyright, so I could just DeepL it.
 　Panse https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269
 　The Book of Proverbs https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9105
	 The Art of Worldly Wisdom: https://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/aww/aww08.htm
 　Machine translation of Wikisource's English translations of parts of Mencius in Japanese commentary.
　Don't be sidetracked with "I'm not a fan of this," and get your book translated into English.
　I can't correct typos afterwards because the typo frequency is obviously higher than when I was younger. I don't want to use Twitter anymore.
　Typo frequency increases for me too (I've experienced it since about after my late 20s), but I wonder why this is. ......[/villagepump/sta.icon]
　At any rate, I'm bumping it up to [when I think I'm in Alaska].
　I used to open Porter every time I wanted to edit from my phone, but now I realize that since I have editing privileges anyway, I should just create a UserScript that opens in Porter.
　　Made [/nishio/open with porter].
　Since both Ii and Tarot are ultimately random selections and then associations with the current situation, why not put them all in Scrapbox and do a random page (...)?
　　I noticed that I can't put extra explanation pages when I try to do it with random pages, I'll put it as a mysterious function of [scrapbox-reader-nishio] when I feel like it (mystery).
　I wonder how Scrapbox Bubble's content can be viewed without transitioning, is it prefetched by you or by Scrapbox itself?
　The Factorio story made me want to play it for the first time in a long time, but I rather think that [Dyson Sphere Program], which I played and neglected in the early days, is about to be updated in various ways and become more balanced.
　The [active reading] page was just coming up.
　　I just did a little [/nishio/The Art of Worldly Wisdom
　　But if I thought it was a little too heterogeneous to include in a project that was mostly my own writing, I did 20 pages and then put it on hold.
　　I wonder if it would be possible to make them appear 5 pages a day or something...
