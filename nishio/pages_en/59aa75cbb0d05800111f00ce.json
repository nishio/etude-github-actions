Geister.
>"Geister" is a 2-player board game, played with 4 "good ghosts" and 4 "bad ghosts" each. You win by defeating all of your opponent's good ghosts. Since you don't know which of your opponent's good ghosts is the good ghost, the game is about trying to guess their intentions by carefully observing their behavior and trying to perceive information that you can't see. Since this is a two-player game, it was not very popular at this camp.

The version that is currently running is still surprisingly (for those who don't know the ins and outs) interesting.
When a user presses the "Start Game" button on the browser, Mr. Miyoshi's Java server and my AI will be activated and connected to each other.
