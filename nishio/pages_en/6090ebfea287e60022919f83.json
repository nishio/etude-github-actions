 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Hash/20090430/1241109755'>The new flu is bad enough, but humanity is awesome (in a biological sense)! - Waiting for the meme carcass</a>.
 Good entry.
 
 >>
 If the impact of influenza is roughly divided into "infectivity" and "toxicity," the type of influenza this time is "normal level of infectivity and weak toxicity," and has not reached the "humanity is doomed" level.
 <<
 
 This is the important part, isn't it? I'm a little panicky and worried, though I'm nervous all at once because of the suspected cases in Japan.
 
 >>
 Certainly, there is a possibility of mutation. But if we consider it as an extension of ordinary influenza, our intuition is that it is impossible to have a scenario in which a mutation that reduces the host's chances of survival has an advantage.
 <<
 
 But the following mutations have an advantage, don't they?
 - the incubation period is prolonged
 - become more infectious
 - More time to remain active after adhering to non-living objects such as train straps
 - Increase in proliferation rate
 - Stronger against water, medicated soaps, etc.
 - Reduced apparent symptoms.
 
 Then, under the situation of "quarantine, test, and treat as soon as influenza-like symptoms appear," the following mutations are not neutral because both developing the disease and killing the host are the same for the virus in terms of "losing the opportunity to reproduce.
 - Tamiflu will not work.
 - Increases toxicity (increases the rate at which people who contract it die)
 
 I myself wonder, "Do mutations happen all the time?" I myself think "Mutations don't happen that often.
 
 *1241153959*emacsclient useful!
 If you do M-x server-start in carbonEmacs and then do $ emacsclient HOGE in the terminal, HOGE will be opened as one buffer of the already opened carbonEmacs. I didn't have to do any particular configuration.
 
 Add (server-start) to .emacs.el to run at carbonEmacs startup, and export EDITOR=emacsclient to .bash_profile to run at terminal startup.
 I wrote "I'm so happy. I'm happy for you.
 
 <hr>
 I forgot to write something important: if you write in emacsclient, use C-x # to exit.
 
 *1241189802*Design Pattern Criticism
 >>
 "The rules of the English language allow one to focus only on the sentences that make sense, without having to wade through a vast number of meaningless sentences. As a result, one can devote one's full attention to the more subtle differences in meaning.
 <<
 
 However, haiku will not be born if you are bound by the rules of the English language.

 Read. Leverage memo below.
 <hr>
 You cannot keep motivation if you feel pressure from external factors. Motivation that comes from within you can be maintained to some extent.
 We do not play with the encouragement of being seen. We do not lose heart even if we are not seen.
 The results do not necessarily correspond to being satisfied with what you are getting. Discrepancies.
 If you practice doing something without sleep, you won't be in a hurry if you can't sleep before an important event.
 Devices to minimize unevenness in mental and physical conditions
 If you look back at the past, you may feel old. But if you look at yourself only now, you will never feel old.
 Not much progress can be expected from change without sacrifice.
 It's easy to lose yourself when you're worried about the way others look at you.
 There's no point in worrying about things that don't necessarily convey your true intentions.
 Bottega bags do not have any recognizable brand markings at a glance.
 Status and position are not important to a real professional. What is important is quality performance and work, and the preparation to produce it.
 Showing off hidden techniques is not always a kindness. It is a fan's prerogative to speculate.
 The goal is "to feel that you have done all you can do.
 You are expected to fail, so you will not lose motivation if you fail.
 We all have times when we are not in good shape. But I don't think we can admit that we are not in good shape.
 People who say to others, "He needs to peel off his skin already," think they are finished. I don't want to be like that.
 When in a slump, do not try to remember your best condition. Make it your goal to get back to average.
 I'm working hard" is something you have other people say, not something you say yourself.

 <body>Multi-tty support is also useful. <br>http://lorentey.hu/project/emacs.html<br>It doesn't seem to work with Carbon Emacs, but it was merged into Emacs 23 series, so it might work with Cocoa Emacs. </body>
