turn magenta

This case
	Phenomenon: I specified a shader from a script and it looked fine on the PC, but on the Oculus Go it turned magenta.
	cause
 	Specify [Unlit/Texture] shader using [Shader.Find] from script
  But the Unity compiler does not know that it is referenced in Shader.Find
  So, they decide "it's a shader we're not using" and remove it from the Oculus Go version.
 cope
 	The "dynamic load" is considered to be the target of [Resources] and anything under [Resources] and referred to from it is not deleted.
  Then, create an appropriate material under Resources and specify Unlit/Texture.
