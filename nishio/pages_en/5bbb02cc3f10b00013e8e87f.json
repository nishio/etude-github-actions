Facebook period
I had been posting on Twitter until then, but switched to Facebook. around 2012, I started to consider moving from Twitter to Facebook, and in February 2013, a possible 250,000 passwords were leaked from Twitter, forcing the users in question to reset their passwords in an incident that resulted in a reset.
Moved to Facebook when Twitter became unavailable for a time.

The fact that Facebook comes around once a year, whereas Twitter was just something that flowed away, created a [spiral staircase] effect of output.

<br> Once I set up a linkage to cross post from Twitter to Facebook, but after thinking about it for a bit, I decided not to do it. <br> That is an action to expand the range of propagation of "content that can be seen by a large number of people" posted on Twitter, and if you take that strategy, it is not reasonable unless you take action to increase your Friends on Facebook as well as on Twitter. However, if you do that, you will only experience again on Facebook what you experienced on Twitter, and nothing interesting will come out of it.

>I can't tweet from my PC anymore because my Twitter password has been reset, but I can tweet on Facebook until I can work it out. There is a high probability that I will stop using Twitter until I can do something about it, though.
