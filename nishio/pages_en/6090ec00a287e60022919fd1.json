 *1247808711*Arduio Serial Communication
 Last time I did only Serial.begin and Serial.println and said "What? It doesn't come out?" I thought I had left it alone, but it turned out that I just had to press the Serial Monitor button in the development environment.

 It's easy. If you bring an appropriate analog sensor and connect it to the PC, you can observe how the value changes on the PC.

 I connected a photo IC. A transparent round one. I didn't know how much resistor to put between them (even if I knew, we don't have enough stock to make just the right resistor), so I put a volume between them.
 
 When I first did an AnalogRead from the Arduino with the volume at maximum, it returned 1023, so I gradually lowered the volume and it started fluctuating between 450 and 550. I cut off a little of the aluminum evaporation packet that contained the tea to shield it from the light and found that the range was 399~401 when it was dark and 440~550 when it was bright. I wondered why there was such a wide range when it was bright, but the lighting is fluorescent, so it must be flickering at 100Hz. That must be the cause.
 
 I'm going to set this up with LEDs later and use it as a heart rate sensor across my earlobe, so I don't have to worry about the fluorescent light flickering for now.

 Volume The one that sticks in the breadboard from Alps Electronics, forget the model number, maybe max 10KOhm B-curve, 150 yen.
 Jumper cable 300 yen

 I'm glad I wrote down the model number because I thought I would lose track if I didn't.　I'm not sure if I should buy 100, 50, and 10 resistors in series or not.
 
 The ultra-bright white LED LP-R5W170 should be 80 ohms, if you are going to put one on. 8 ohms is fine if you are going to put 10 of them in parallel.

 No one said, "That's your perception that's wrong!" They didn't say, "You're wrong!

 Oh wow, that's great from around the 14 minute mark. That's what this was all about.
