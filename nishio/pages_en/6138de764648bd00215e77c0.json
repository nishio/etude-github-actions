　　Photo taken 5T after the switch was turned off.
　　Items are gone from the upper hopper before 3T and the lower hopper has items from 3T
　　Four ticks were present in the lower hopper.
　　So here's what I'm saying.

　　　Huh? Then you can't put items in the chest with a 5-tick pulse?
　PS: I think this happens after the comparator checks for the presence of the item and then the movement of the item occurs, delaying detection by 1T

　I could sleep there or...

　Items not put in by hand by humans but sent in by hoppers are sucked up by one tick into the hopper below.

 Same "item sent by the hopper" but when a human turns it on, it's a 2T.
 In other words, if it's already on when you enter the upper hopper, you move in 1T.
 　If OFF, move 2T after it is turned ON.
 　Would that be inconsistent with moving at 5T?
