Vipassana meditation
When we hear the word "meditation," we tend to think of calming the mind, but that is only one of the two meditations ([cessation]/Samatha and Vipassana).
Vipassana is the process of trying to arrive at the truth by observing the movements of one's mind.
　In short [objectification of the mind].

>Cessation (shikan, Sanskrit: śamatha-vipaśyanā) is the main form of Buddhist meditation. It is sometimes phonetically transcribed from Sanskrit as ṣamatha-vipaśyāna....
> In Buddhism, meditation is divided into two main categories: cessation and contemplation. Cessation (shamatha) means to abide in the truth of the true source of all things, without allowing one's mind to become agitated. Vipassiyana (vipassana) is the act of wisdom through the immovable mind to observe things correctly and in accordance with the truth.

>Vipassana meditation (vipassanā-bhāvanā) is a meditation in which one gains insight into impermanence, suffering, and selflessness, which are considered truths in Buddhism, by observing nāma (the workings of the mind) and rūpa (matter, translated as color). In the U.S., it is also called "insight meditation" because it is practiced without Buddhist overtones.
