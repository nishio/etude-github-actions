Turn off software keyboard
	In Safari on the iPhone, focus on the text area and the software keyboard is out.
		window.innerHeight becomes smaller.
	And when I came back to look at other apps for a while...
		Document rendering is done at a height where there is no software keyboard
			(window.innerHeight will be larger)
		The software keyboard is left out even though
	This results in content rendered below the software keyboard
		I can't afford to have important content hidden away.
	Just blur when it becomes hidden by visibilitychange.

code:ts
 document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", function () {
   if (document.visibilityState === "hidden") {
     if (document.activeElement) {
       // @ts-ignore
       if (document.activeElement.blur) {
         // @ts-ignore
         document.activeElement.blur()
       }
     }
   }
 });
