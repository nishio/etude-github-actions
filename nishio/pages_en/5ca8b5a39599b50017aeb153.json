Information Sharing and Communication
Whether it is clear "who should read the information."

It is clear who should read [information transfer], but not clear who should read [information sharing].

And what is the benefit of writing and sharing information in groupware that is not clear to the people who should read it?
 What you write can be mentioned later (using [permalink], etc.)
 You can [search] what you wrote.
This is because we can benefit from the advances in information processing technology that have made it possible for us to do so.
