Stickies should be added in a visible position
I think this was solved by [text input field to top of screen] [pRegroup-done-2019].
	>When I scroll down the screen and add a new sticky, it is added in a place where it is not visible (at the top) at that position.

		TODO: This is a bug and will be fixed
			If implemented correctly, sticky additions are always placed in order starting from the upper right corner of the current field of view.
			On iPad, it is placed in the upper right corner without any problem after scrolling.
				Is the misalignment caused by the difference in screen size?
