intro-heuristics
[A - AtCoder Contest Scheduling https://atcoder.jp/contests/intro-heuristics/tasks/intro_heuristics_a]
ã€€Two hours seemed short, but I feel like this is fine because longer would be exhausting.
	atcoder 605th. repeated attempts are hard in python. only 37 were made. couldn't even compile in numba in time.
	By the way, first of all, I repeatedly made the most advanced selections from my head to Greedy, and then I randomly shook the discount rate, which I discount ahead of time, because the pattern is "if you get a higher score in a few days and you do it now, you lose" when it is not good at what point.
	I didn't know there was a way to get it out on PyPy.
		I tried to get it out again with PyPy and it was RE with numpy import.

NUMBA is not able to use PREF_COUNTER and it's hard to do "calculation until the last minute of time".
Maybe I was right to use PyPy instead of numpy to get it out.
