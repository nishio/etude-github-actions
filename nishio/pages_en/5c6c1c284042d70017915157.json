Novelty, Solution, Wholeness

I was surprised and amused by the mismatched interpretations of the word "smart", including the new options proposed in the replies.

I chose "[SOLUTION]" and I will note the thought process.
Since "[novelty]" is not accompanied by the condition "[must be] useful," I interpreted it to mean "come up with something new, whatever it is." This is a simple task that can be accomplished by simply combining randomly selected elements, so being able to do this does not make you smart.
As for "[wholeness]," it is a simple task that can be accomplished by first writing down the big picture, then breaking it down, and locally screwing up the inconvenient parts, which does not make you smart.
The remaining "solvability" is a useful act because it is solving a problem. It would be a difficult task because it is a problem that no one else can solve. So this was the only option that could be "smart".

The interpretation of "smart" is muddled, but perhaps the interpretation of "dumb" is similar.
