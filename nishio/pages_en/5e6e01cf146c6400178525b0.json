Level K thinking
>K=0 thinking is to decide on a strategy based purely on the rationality of the situation at hand. K=1 thinking is when you read that your opponent (or everyone else) is thinking with K=0, and then decide that it would be better for you to do so. Furthermore, K=2 thinking is to assume that everyone else will at least think K=1, and then decide what you should do.
	Contest conducted by the Financial Times newspaper in the U.K. in April 1997
	Proposed by economist Richard Sailer
	Choose one integer between 0 and 100.
	The winner is the person who wrote the number closest to the average of the numbers selected by all participants multiplied by two thirds.
	33 is the K=0
	0 or 1 is [Nash equilibrium].
	　This is equivalent to K=12
	The actual winner was 13, equivalent to K=2.
	　In other words, most people were thinking about K=1
