 He couldn't find the Marunouchi Line and got lost. I got on a train bound for Ikebukuro and ran out to get off the train.
 
 *1199676248*New Lab.
 I was in a hurry because I couldn't find the map that I had put in my bag and couldn't locate the new lab,
 
 Wikipedia already knew the location of the new lab! >http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B5%A4%E5%9D%82%E3%83%84%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC
 
 I mean, it's amazing that it even lists the companies that have occupied a particular building in the past.

 I had to log in as a user with Sysop privileges, but I had forgotten my username and password. I guessed the password on a hunch.
 
 *1199692658* tomorrow
 Oh, I need to find out where to go and how to get there.
 
 *1199697396*Sequel to Tomorrow
 At any rate, I decided to leave home by 9:30 a.m. and go to Tokyo Station and say, "I want to go to Odawara.
 
 I thought I had a lot of sticky notes, but they are all missing and there is no place to write notes...

 Oh, by the way, no one was able to copy the technique (of course not).
 
 Should I have put a CC mark or something on it? I didn't even get a business model patent (wrong).

 Actually, I'm planning to put an org sticker on my company's business card, so it's a relief to know that it's not patented!
 
 No, it's not, they're made by the company, so it's normal for them to include it, but before they did, they made 100 copies with the new lab address, so...

 I'm sorry to say that I'm just getting excited, but I have to go home and get ready for the conference tomorrow.
 I wonder if someone could compile a log on video streaming (CamTwist) and put it up on the Wiki (other help).
 
 *1199718495* Problems with the recruitment process for the 1000 speaker project and a bill to address them.
 I have just realized that those who were slow to respond to the first call and missed the deadline are likely to miss the second call as well.
 
 If we can assign unique IDs to each account on the wiki, then each time someone gets in line but overflows the limit, 1 point will be added to their account, and when 5 points are accumulated, a recruitment notice will be emailed 24 hours before the others. Of course, the number of points would be reset to zero when a participant joins.
