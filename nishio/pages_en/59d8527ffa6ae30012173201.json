Modular and Integral
There are two ways to [product architecture
　Combination type (modular)
　Integral

[Modular]
 Combining relatively large [parts
 Locally efficient in that parts can be reused
 [Interaction between modules] must follow a standardized protocol
 Extra [overhead] and inefficiency occur at [seams] of parts.
 　Worse than integral type with respect to [global characteristics] such as overall footprint, weight, power consumption, etc.
 Module components can be independent products and can be easily procured from other companies
 [Modularity Trap] # Trap

[Integral]
	Small component granularity
 Interactions are not standardized.
 Tuning to the crunch can create [a competitive advantage].
