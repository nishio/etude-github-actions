Easy-to-read articles
	Japanese laws can be viewed in article form on e-Gov e-Gov. Example: [Civil Code on e-Gov http://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/search/elawsSearch/elaws_search/lsg0500/detail?lawId=129AC0000000089]
 But the letters are small and hard to read on a smartphone or iPad.
 I want something easy to view on my phone or iPad.

 既知の問題点
 	Font size is still a bit small for viewing on iPad. I would like to have an adjustment function.
  Copyright Law 81 is incorrectly labeled.
   Since the hierarchy below No. 1 appears
  The text of the furigana will be prefixed with the furigana: `A person who has defamed or damaged the reputation of another`.
  When I put a link to Facebook, a strange part of the link is cut off and displayed.

	I was doing [redirects for SPA in Netlify] and realized it would be useful for this project as well.
		It can solve the problem of "When I put a link to Facebook, a strange part of the link is cut off and displayed.

　The previous prototype was XML to HTML in Python.
　　In the future, TS will parse XML and create screens with DOM manipulation.
　Previous repository renamed [https://github.com/nishio/better_egov_html Github]
	I was able to verify that meta can be out by URL path and SSR by netlify [Github https://github.com/nishio/better_egov/blob/7805b89203a29f9713b9e4ae0fedf8d82d017826 /src/App.tsx]

The problem of "when I link to Facebook, strange parts are cut off and displayed", I realized that it would be better to create a "Share button" and the URL obtained by the button would be a link to the article itself.
	Create a static page for each article?
	Or is it better to use JS to narrow down the display?

  We have decided to call all "structures for holding other things" such as knitting and chapters collectively as containers.
 https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/minpo.html#c3.1.5.1.3
  Can be linked to `Part III: Claims, Chapter I: General Provisions, Section 5: Extinguishment of Claims, Subsection 1: Payment, Division 3: Subrogation by Payment` in `#c3.1.5.1.3`.

	Copy function restored.
 	[https://gyazo.com/8985a5f6762b7e4b1b2cd5e1274bc700]
		The copy button in the address section copies everything in the black frame.
  The copy button to the right of "Article X" copies the portion excluding the address (in this case, "(Method of deposition)" and thereafter).
  The copy button to the right of each section copies only that section.

	Directly below each container is a child container of that container and a link to its sibling containers.
  I wanted it when I was using the previous version.

 Copy function once gone.
 	I'm undecided where to put the button and where to make it a copy target.
 Can now convert directly from e-Gov XML
 	So it should be possible to convert every possible law.
  However, it was made with civil law in mind, so if you include other laws, there probably won't be any editions and you'll get an error.
  I'll do that area another time. Personally, I want to do copyright law and patent law.

   特許法 https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/tokkyohou.html

	Known problems and what you wish you had
  There is a ruby in the case and it is not handled correctly: `a person who has defamed another`.
		If the article number is hung, it would be nice if it could be a link too.
  	Rather cumbersome as there are many different patterns.
   	`A trial for commencement of assistance shall be made together with a trial under Article 17, paragraph (1) or a trial under Article 876-9, paragraph (1). `
		When zooming on iPad, I want the text to wrap at the width of the screen after zooming.
  	I've been doing a lot of research and trying, but I don't know the best way to do it.
  I want the article to appear in the preview properly when I post it on Facebook, etc.
  	I was getting one in v1, but I don't know why not in v2.
   From the behavior of [this https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnishio.github.io%2Fbetter_egov%2Fminpo_v1.html%23s3] Then it seems to be picking up the content of the first p-tag that appears first, such that there is more than a certain percentage of ground content that is not a link, etc.
   It is now displayed by enclosing it with a p tag.
   	[https://gyazo.com/377a55bcaf5b7f796d1093a716482f5e]
				But if you look closely, you can see that the link is to Article 556, but what is shown is Article 557.
    Also, the notation "what article" doesn't show up.
   	I just noticed that even in v1, it shows Article 556.2, even though it links to Article 556.

   I looked at https://schema.org/ and it doesn't look like a solution


Prototype version 1
 https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/minpo_v1.html#555
  You can link to section 555 with `#555`.
 https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/minpo_v1.html#s3
  `#s3` can link to 3 editions.
 Tap the area marked `[copy]` to copy the article to the clipboard.
 感想
  It would be useful if the structure directly below each heading appeared
  They say the headline should be before the article.
   住所
   見出し
   何条何項何号 条文
  The #'s are just bullet points, but they want to put permalinks.
  Wouldn't it be better to convert from e-Gov xml
   In the future, it would be better to support e-Gov XML to increase the number of articles covered.
   For now, the most recent layout is limited to civil law and can be done by trial and error, so it can be put off until later.
 Still small on iPad
  Would it be nice to have the ability to zoom to 2x and limit the width?
