One-minute thinking time
A method in which a one-minute [thinking time] is provided at the beginning of the [question and answer] period, during which the presenter observes silence.

Common Question and Answer Problems
	In a typical question-and-answer session, the speaker calls out, "Who has a question?", guess who raises their hand, and the dialogue begins.
	Those who were trying to think of a question are interrupted before they can organize their thoughts. Because they want to hear the dialogue.
	Those unfamiliar with questions need time to organize their thoughts and formulate questions."
	As soon as the dialogue is over, they call out, "Next questioner~," so there is no time to think.
	If the content was flowing all the time, I would be too busy listening to it to gather my thoughts.

improvement plan
	Start with one minute of thinking time
		Raise your hand if you have a question.
		He shakes the number, "Then you're number three."
	After the thinking time is over, ask and answer questions in turn, "Okay, number 1 person -".
	When it's all over, it's time to go back to thinking time.


I devised and tried it out in my lecture [Intellectual Production Techniques of Engineers and Physical Education Type Classes].

The presenter must also remain silent during the one-minute thinking time.
There is no point in speaking if you let the anxiety of silence get the better of you.

	>"Catch-ball presentation" taught by @nishio in #BPStudy 135, I've done it several times and all have been very successful with a lot of questions, so I can only thank him for that!

	[slido style]
		During the above experiment, the question was "raise your hand, orally."
		Wouldn't it be better to digitize that too in the first place?
