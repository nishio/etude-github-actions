And while we're at it, middle and high school students continue to be deprived of opportunities to participate in school trips, summer camp-type events, national competitions, etc.? Are you insane?

The number of reproductions has exceeded one since before the Olympics were held, so it's only a matter of time before the infection spreads.

If the Olympics are held and the number of infections increases afterwards, the world will interpret it as causation, even if it is not causation.

With the spread of infection after the Olympics and stricter controls than before to control it, the hate that "it's the fault of forcing the Olympics" will increase.
The reason why there are reports now that can be interpreted as "Cabinet members are against it, but the prime minister forced it through" is to make the prime minister the only one to be vilified.

>Volunteers will receive the first dose from June 30 to July 3, with the second dose starting July 31 during the Olympics.

>Of the more than 1,200 people who died in Osaka Prefecture in the fourth wave, more than 900 died without endotracheal intubation, which means that about three-quarters of them died in a state of respiratory distress without intubation.
>In Osaka, the fatality rate had previously been 4-5%, but only in April did it triple to 12%, and the same was true for people in their 80s. Compared to Tokyo, the risk of fatality was 3.4 times higher.
