We've been making IT-related tools for a while now, and we want to make sure that the villagers stand by them.

what to do about it

There is a carpet under the villagers' feet, but there is actually an occupational block buried under it.
Villagers try to stand by their occupational block to work during the day, so you can have villagers stand in front of the PC

Note that the height of the desk is 1, so the villagers can climb on the desk if it is left as it is.
I have a barrier block on my desk to prevent that.
