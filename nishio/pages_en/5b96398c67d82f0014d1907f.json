Specific examples of how titles are replaced in Japanese translations
On p. 123 of "[The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production]," I wrote about how I don't trust book titles because in some cases they do not adequately summarize the content for commercial reasons. I had initially introduced three specific examples there, but through subsequent discussions with the editor, I removed them, so I present them here instead.

>I do not trust book titles and subtitles. For commercial reasons, they often do not adequately summarize the content. Especially when I compare the original title of a translated book with the Japanese title, I sometimes wonder why they changed it in this way.

>For example, "Sprint - How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days" will be sold in Japan as "SPRINT: The Fastest Way to Work. Goldratt's Theory of Constraints - A Systems Approach to Continuous Improvement (Dr. Goldratt's Logical Thinking Process - Create the Strongest Company with TOC! and "Thinking for a Change" is titled "The Thinking Process of Smart People - Ready-to-Use, Diagrammatic and Logical Problem Solving Skills.

The subtitle of Thinking for a Change was not introduced.
Thinking for a Change: Putting the TOC Thinking Processes to Use
So it's like "Thinking for Change: Using the TOC Thinking Process."

	[SPRINT最速仕事術]
 [Dr. Goldratt's Logical Thinking Process].
 [The thought process of a smart person].
