	[I solved the puzzle while explaining my thinking!]
		An approach to verbalizing what you are thinking while working with your mind.
		It's not working.

			The two are clearly in different modes, switching between them.
			However, if I don't say anything and just record it, even I, reviewing the recording, can't figure out what I was thinking, so would it be better to say something vague and unclear?

		Make a handwritten recording B on the iPad to match camera recording A
		P in P to superimpose B on A
		This is done first through without commentary, recorded, and then explained later.
		This is something I can put on later because the sessions were short and it was clear what we were doing.
