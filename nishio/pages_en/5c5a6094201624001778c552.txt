20190205KJ method experiment by Mr. Tachikawa
	[Tomoya Tachikawa]
	[KJ method]
	[Sticky note is not the body.]
	[Group stickies without categorizing them.]
	[Write it yourself first].
	[Sticky note size]
	[Granularity of sticky note]
 To those who are trying to set up an axis and categorize them, I say, "First, take the two sticky notes that seem most relevant out of these 100, and put them here."
 Starting with small, well-defined boundary groups, ask, "What is this group like?" and ask
 Hear a word that is not on a sticky note and suggest, "Let's write that down on a sticky note.
 Large, complex shapes are started after the smaller ones have a nameplate.
 Cut out the obvious part and then further divide the surroundings by "what you want to get closer to it and what you want to get further away from it".

	RICOH THETA (not yet sucked out)
		Recording 1: Ends at 25 minutes, the only data recorded of the conversation at the beginning of the event if the THETA is to blame for the recording interruption on the main phone.
		Recording 2: about 15 minutes, full disk died
	Smartphone A
		No photo
		Recording A1 13:35 Distant view camera, battery was debilitated and died

		Recording A2 19:18 start, 1:11:12 after battery died, connected to power and switched to recording charge
	Smartphone B
		Recording B2 2:22:30
		Video B1
			2:04:48 If this is well taken, probably the most continuous data of the work in the conference room.
			Early on, I was taking pictures of my own hand.
			After 1:02:00, after the camera trouble was observed, the full view is taken (but inverted up and down).
			Around 1:20:00, the seek does not proceed or the image turns black.
				Is it a problem with the video or the display?
				Even on the phone, time is 2 hours but white after 1:20:00, must be some kind of trouble.
			So, should we think of it as a 20-minute video with a full view?

			It's a title-copying process.
			I put it in Dropbox.

	[Recording on iPad]
		Halfway through the session, I realized that my phones were malfunctioning, so I started recording.
		Judging from the capacity, it could be recorded from 18:20.

			Around 15:30 in THETA Video 1, I come in with my iPad and put it on my desk, so I assume he noticed that the voice memo on his phone stopped in front of this and threw in the iPad to take it through.

		The timing of this THETA Video 2 interruption is around 35 minutes into the C1 video.

			By the time you get to about the hour mark in this video C, the first stage of grouping will be completed.
		I've just said the end of this video and I'm still copying the title of the first level group.

			Around 30 minutes of this is a discussion about "reachability," where you're like, "Huh?" where it becomes "Huh?
