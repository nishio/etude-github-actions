Cut out the part of interest
	[direct quotation model]
	Similar to [attention mechanism], but attention itself needs to be fed back to humans
 [Viterbi Algorithm] used in [Hidden Markov Models].
 [granularity of text].
 	I need something a little longer than keyphrase extraction.
  I want it to be natural as "[speech]."
  With key phrases, it's too short.

	It's a little tricky when it's [ppoi]-based.
 	Multiple discriminators are trained from a single data set.
  It's a big deal to create the data naively, because it's an identification task for each character in a sentence.
  	280,000 lines
  	Interactive mode is slow.
  	Downsampling implemented.
