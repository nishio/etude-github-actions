Knowledge shouldn't be free"?
>[hottaqu https://web.archive.org/web/20211019213408/https://twitter.com/hottaqu/status/1450575972642684930]: in my opinion "knowledge should not be free" This is a good thing. There is a strong tendency to disregard "knowledge" in this country, and I think one of the reasons for this is the strong awareness that "knowledge" is free stuff that falls on the internet. This is partly because the providers of "knowledge" have been generous and have given it away for free.

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1452801687790317572]: there's not much rational reason why "knowledge" shouldn't be free. I think the only people who have a problem with it are those who work with knowledge.
>But that's the same structure that makes labor cheaper as it becomes simpler and simpler, so it can't be stopped.
>Still, there is value in the execution phase because there are only a handful of people who can implement it in the end.
 >[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1452802429477548033]: I've taught them many things, but in the end they can't do it. Most people can't.
 >We need to make the necessary investments and nurture them in a step-by-step order.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1452804077067247620]: well, but I don't think it's as free lying around as it seems. The key "knowledge" is usually only known by those who know what they're talking about.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1452832349658304514]: I think the idea that "knowledge should be paid for" is an idea that undermines social benefit because it is orthogonal to whether there is a social benefit when knowledge is given to someone and whether that person has the ability to pay for the knowledge. Therefore, I think that "knowledge should be paid for" is an idea that undermines social benefits.
>Especially for junior high and high school students, the financial burden of paying 5,000 yen for a technical book is heavier than for working people.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1452833122454675461]: I think we should take tax money from working people and use it to allow junior high and high school students to buy specialized books for 5,000 yen for 500 yen or to borrow them from a nearby library. We think it's a good idea.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1452833938821423110]: I think there should be a book santa business that delivers $4,800 O'Reilly books to people who are reading 10 year old technical books that happen to be in their local library because they don't have the money, or reading personal blogs full of mistakes after searching the internet. I think there should be a book santa business that delivers $4,800 O'Reilly books or something to people who are reading 10 year old technical books that just happen to be in their local library because they don't have the money.

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1452837742757351425]: I think it's ok for farmers to eat, sell, or give away radishes themselves, though I have a feeling that's not how knowledge works either.
>I'm sure a lot depends on your position.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1452838420640796672]: I feel that if we forget that any choice is free on an individual level, we are covered in bias.
	>[kuboon https://twitter.com/kuboon/status/1452846050528485382]: there's a theory that if farmers start giving away their radishes for free instead of selling them, the radish market will drop and it will bother other radish farmers.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1452847055190179843]: If we go in the direction of "let's agree on a price to prevent the market from going down," it will become a [cartel], won't it?
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1452848258682810368]: and I have a feeling that it is not sustainable for a certain individual to go radish to the point that the market drops, so the result is harmless.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1452850886405853193]: ah, I see. Unlike radishes, information is cheap to replicate, so if someone gives it away cheaply, the market price goes down.
 >On the other hand, "applying knowledge to individual specific situations" is expensive to replicate.
 >I think that knowledge that is inexpensive to duplicate should be duplicated more and more.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1452852591038124034]: However, I'm not sure if it's actually possible to copy it, since there seems to be widespread reading comprehension problems according to the University of Tokyo robot study.

>[Fukuso_Sutaro https://twitter.com/Fukuso_Sutaro/status/1452953383510233089]: You should really be careful when elites say things like "knowledge should not be free", because even if they don't intend it to mean that "poor people who can't pay for it should crawl there for the rest of their lives". You should really be careful about it, even if that's not the intention.

>[kaityo256 https://twitter.com/kaityo256/status/1452977318868123651]: I think "not selling knowledge cheaply" and "putting knowledge online for free" are not contradictory attitudes.
	>[kaityo256 https://twitter.com/kaityo256/status/1453005931084660747]: I would replace "putting knowledge on the net for free" with "thinking knowledge should be put on the net for free and telling others to put it on the net". You can also say.
	>[kaityo256 https://twitter.com/kaityo256/status/1453017567316963337]: I think it's a rather good strategy to give people who want to make something and publish it enough money to live on and leave them alone! ......
	>[kaityo256 https://twitter.com/kaityo256/status/1453023982362378241]: Well, to sum it up, I understand that you want people to be more aware that knowledge has a cost, but I think it's a bad idea to make people aware of the cost by charging for good knowledge.

>[tanakahisateru https://twitter.com/tanakahisateru/status/1453028754524049411]: The original source of knowledge is free, but the more the introductory book becomes understandable to everyone (with videos and one-on-one lessons), the more money it costs. It's the same with OSS: the source code is free, but when you combine it with UI, it becomes valuable, and it costs a lot of money if someone sticks around to maintain it. Code is knowledge itself.
	>[tanakahisateru https://twitter.com/tanakahisateru/status/1453030662823288834]: In the physical world, the purer the original, the more valuable it is, and degraded copies become less and less valuable. For those in industry who have lived with this sense, it is difficult to understand software. I feel like we've been dragging around for decades the misconceptions of people from the physical era about how much a thing is worth, how much quantity was produced, and so on.
