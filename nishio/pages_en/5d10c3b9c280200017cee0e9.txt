graphics sticky note
	I don't need to create another class, just close the view part of the sticky by saying that if the text contains the URL of an image, it will be rendered as an image sticky.

Gyazo URL is not image-like
	Actual HTML returns.
	Adding .png or .jpg returns an image, but which is correct depends on the data
	If I add /thumb/130, it returns an image with a width of 130, so I guess that's what I'm looking for.
	When a vertical image comes in, it will overflow, so it is necessary to add a process to cut off the image if it exceeds the size in the upper alignment.

It would be nice to be able to upload photos and screenshots to Gyazo
