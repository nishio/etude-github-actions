 **1231752757* Regarding self-praise
 I don't know if it is "Japanese," "East Asians," or "people under the influence of Confucian culture," but there is a strong tendency to dislike self-praise and self-promotion. I wonder if that is the cause of the "the nail that sticks out gets hammered down" tendency.
 
 *1231753226*â– 
 I got a trackback and thought I'd mention it, but it's a mystery to me why people bite so hard on the "I know it in my head, but it kind of bugs me" story.
 
 *1231783853*Preparation for the conference
 During the last cleanup, I found that I tend to get more done if I write down what needs to be done first and then act on it, so I'll use the same method to prepare for my trip.
 
 First, what you need: a change of clothes for 2 nights and 3 days. No business cards, as I ran out at the 81st year-end party. I don't need all that hardware, since I haven't finished my Trump image recognition program after all; I'll take my MacBook, AC adapter, iPod and cell phone, and make sure they're charged; and I'll bring my laptop. Let's see, what else do I need?
 
 There is a pilchre. I'm going to drink it because it seems to be fermenting if left unattended.
 
 The other important thing is that I don't have any money in my wallet, so I have to withdraw it before I go. I set my alarm for 7:30 a.m. to make sure I had enough time to get there, including a stop at the bank on the way, since I needed to be at the station by 9:20 a.m.
 
 I wonder what the rest is. I feel like I'm forgetting something.
 
 I emailed the results of the transfer guide to my cell phone. My cell phone was fully charged. I put the charging cable in my bag.

 There were oranges.

 I woke up safely at 7:30. It's 8:31, 8 minutes to the train station, and the train I'm on is at 9:43; if I knew the location of Mizuho Bank around Shimbashi or Odawara station, I would have left already, but I don't know, so I wait another 15 minutes or so.
 
 -----
 
 Oh, there's the sound of garbage collection. That's right, I always forget to put out the garbage because I can't remember that I have to put it out until I hear this sound even though I get up at 7:30. This time, I took it out around 3:00 a.m. It was the day of garbage collection. It's the day of garbage collection, after all.
