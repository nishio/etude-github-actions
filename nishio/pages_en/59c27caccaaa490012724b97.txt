Is the perceptron's activity function a threshold function?
Discussion of whether "the perceptron's active function is a threshold function" is correct as a proposition.

	The first artificial neuron proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1942 was a threshold function
	Rosenblatt's 1958 paper (1) introduced what we now call the weight matrix. At this point, he used the name perceptron. At this time, it is still a threshold function.
 In paper (2), of which Rosenblatt is the last author in 1962, he introduced the activity function Φ and again defined it as the threshold function.
 I believe that Rosenblatt's monograph "Principles of Neurodynamics", also from 1962, claims that "the active function Φ can be many different functions", but I haven't read it, so I haven't checked.
	Because of this change in Rosenblatt's concept of the perceptron, it becomes "the activity function of the perceptron is a threshold function" when referring to the first proposal, and "the activity function of the perceptron is not necessarily a threshold function when referring to Rosenblatt's entire contribution (because the introduction and generalization of the concept of activity function (because it is also his contribution that introduced and generalized the concept of an active function)".
