collect one's thoughts
>Writing consists of two stages. The first stage is to summarize thoughts. The second is the stage of actually expressing them in writing. Generally, when we talk about writing, we tend to think of the second stage as the technical stage, but in fact, the first stage, "summarizing your thoughts," is very important. It is obvious that you cannot write a sentence if you do not have something to write about. In order to write a sentence, you must first formulate the content of the sentence.
[Technology of Intellectual Production] p.200

[I used the term "organize your head" in the [tool to organize your head], but "organize your thoughts" is probably closer to "organize your thoughts" in describing what this tool will help you do.
　Before a coherent output can be produced, you must first gather your thoughts.
　In order to "organize" those "thoughts", first output them as "unorganized fragments" and then organize them.

>The inside of a person's head is, I'm sorry to say, a very complicated thing. When knowledge and images come to the surface of our consciousness, they never appear in an orderly, logical form. When they come to the surface of our consciousness, they never come out in logical form, but when we put them into writing, we make an effort to put them into logical form. If you write "as you think of it," it will not be a sentence at all.

Therefore, we first try to spit out everything that comes to mind incoherently, and then build it up.
The specific methodology will be the [Kozane method].
