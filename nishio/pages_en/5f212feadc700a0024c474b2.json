　We could have done this by adding a few features to [RAKE].
　RAKE combines key phrases when they occur two or more times in the same order
　　Sharing information" and "sharing information" are also candidates when "information" and "sharing" are key phrases.
　　At this time, these key phrases can be grouped into a single group by grouping the key phrase sequence as a key
　　Use the shortest one as the representative point of the group
