[https://note.com/4bata/n/n0a44276a0ef1 Sometimes the "effort to understand the conclusion" is misinterpreted as "the effort to draw that conclusion" when a simple explanation is given.]

If you actually have the experience of [intellectual production] through [trial and error] yourself, it's [empirically obvious] that there is a lot of trial and error behind what you see, but people who do nothing but consume probably don't understand that.
