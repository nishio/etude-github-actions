The case of the missing muffler
	Leaving the company conference room
	eat lunch
	I feel "cold in the neck" when I leave the restaurant where I had lunch.
	No scarf in down jacket pocket.
	I looked in my bag, but there's no scarf in it.
	I went back to the store to see if I had forgotten my scarf, but I couldn't find it.
	Returns to the office after deciding he left it in the conference room.
		This interpretation is unnatural because there is no "memory of feeling cold in the neck when I left the office."
	Not even in the company's conference room.
	Possibly dropped between the conference room and the store.
		Interpretation: "I was wearing a scarf when I left the office, but as I was walking I got hot, took it off, put it in my pocket, but it fell out of my pocket."
	I walked to the store and looked, but it didn't drop.
	interpretation
		I left it in the conference room, but it was retrieved as a forgotten item before I went to check on it.
		Dropped on the street, but reported to the police or other authorities before I went to check on it.
	In the meantime, I'm going back to my seat to see if there's any information on the lost and found thread in the internal groupware.
	When I took off my down jacket, I found a scarf in the hood of the jacket.

Conclusion.
	event
		Leave the office wearing a scarf.
		Go into the store, take off the down and put it on your lap, take off the scarf and put it in the hood.
		Wear it as is, not noticing the scarf in the hood when leaving the store.
		When I went outside, my neck was cold and I realized I didn't have a scarf.
	[Prevention of recurrence].
		If you can't find a scarf, look for a hood too.
		When something unexpected happens, rewind and think about each specific step of the action you took.
			The mistake was to jump to the "left it in the conference room" interpretation when I had already noticed that it was somewhat unnatural at the point of "I went back to the store and found no muffler."
