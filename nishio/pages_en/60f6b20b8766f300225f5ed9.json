Air to hit
For those who read the "air" and feel a sense of unity and exhilaration by hitting the "targets" that everyone else is hitting, there is no one to tell them that this "air" is nothing more than an illusion.
Because the risks outweigh the benefits, as the air of "it's okay to hit" may turn into "it's okay to hit the critic" while "the air of 'it's okay to hit'" dominates the scene.
As time goes by, the "air of "it's okay to hit" goes away and another air of "there's no way you can hit me" comes in.
And people say, "How can you hit me?" and start hitting people who have hit people in the past.
