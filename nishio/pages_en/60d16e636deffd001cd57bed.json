Social triggers in Scrapbox
[Social triggers] were, until rather recently, specifically imagined in the form of "ego-search to find mentions of my blog or Scrapbox on Twitter," etc.
Lately, however, I've been feeling that mentions in Scrapbox are by far more useful as triggers than short-form Twitter because they keep contextual information.
Then shouldn't Scrapbox be ego-searched on a regular basis?
