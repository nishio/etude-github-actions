I would like to complete the lecture outline.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I would like to complete my lecture outline.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "lecture outline" is that?
[nishio.icon]After briefly mentioning that I gave a talk of the same name in 2014, followed by the publication of a well-received book containing the content of that talk some years later, I will briefly explain what information will be conveyed in this talk and how it will benefit the audience.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "audience" is that "audience"?
[nishio.icon] middle and high school students, most of whom take the college entrance exam and enter college.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "junior high school or high school student" is that "junior high school or high school student"?
[nishio.icon]Well, if you measure them by their ability to think logically, they're probably in the top 10% of their age group.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "thinking ability" is that?
[nishio.icon]The ability to solve a problem that is known to be solvable in time and whose solution fits within the scope of a defined curriculum, when given an explicit "this is the problem to solve".
[nisbot.icon]What "curriculum" is that?
[nishio.icon]It's a choice of how to solve a problem, and in the case of the exam, that has been limited to a fairly narrow range.
[nisbot.icon]What "options" are those "options"?
[nishio.icon]Often in solving problems in life, I didn't realize there was such a choice! You may think, "I wasn't told that I had such a choice. You may think that it is unfair that you are not told in advance that you have such a choice, but the assumption that you are given all the options in advance is wrong.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "option"?
[nishio.icon]So it is important to recognize that there are many options other than the ones we are given or can see, and to try to increase our own options.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its a "choice"?
[nishio.icon]It's just by chance, or hearing about it through people, or being asked to do it byname. Few things are widely known.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "Jinden" is that?
[nishio.icon]Watching interesting people doing interesting things, I wonder if it comes from people who are highly sensitive to new options.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "choice"?
[nishio.icon]Aside from that, so far, you can raise the issue, but not solve anything by listening to the lecture. Either touch on the topic of unexplored juniors or talk about "making things" including programming.

 > Watching interesting people doing interesting things, I wonder if it comes from people who are highly sensitive to new options.
 Where is this "choice"?
[nishio.icon]Ultimately, we can say that any choice is in the mind, because if the subject of the decision doesn't realize that it is a choice, it doesn't function as a choice. And it can be ignored unconsciously.
[nisbot.icon]What does that "choice" look like?
I think it is like a branch of the [nishio.icon]path. Oh, it seems to be related to [the relationship between the branches of the path and teaching each other] that we talked about at Toyota Tech.
[nisbot.icon]What "branch" is that "branch"?
[nishio.icon]In other words, you will have more people to teach each other if you take a different path rather than walking on the same rails as others.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "rail" is that "rail"?
[nishio.icon]The rails of life, I'm on the rails at this point in my life attending a progressive school. I don't think we should go off that rail at this point in time, but in the same age group, for example, there's an emerging force called N High School, where there's another option.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]I wonder if it would be good to be able to tell people that there are more choices and that there is no such thing as the "right choice" for that, that we can know after the fact whether a choice was right or not, and that the power to make that choice and recognize good choices is not acquired without using it, so it is good to be aware of it and use it. ...
[nisbot.icon]Where does that "choice" come from?
[Nishio.icon]It exists in a form that is difficult to see in the surroundings, but can be found by the trained eye, or an environment that makes it easy to find can be created in advance.

 > I wonder if it would be good to be able to tell them that there are more choices and that, for that matter, there is no such thing as the "right choice" and that they can know after the fact whether they made the right choice or not, and that the ability to make that choice and recognize good choices is not acquired without using it, so it is good to be aware of it. ...
 What would you like to see happen regarding this "option"?
[nishio.icon]The more, the better. Not too many and not too confusing.

 What kind of "do" is this "do"?
