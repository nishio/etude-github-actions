Two problems with Japanese LLMs
I made the picture because many people confuse the two issues regarding Japanese LLMs.

There are people who talk about the "Japanese LLMs don't mean anything" kind of thing from the 1 perspective.
2 Perspectives
	[Information density is reversed in GPT3].
	[A thought on the Japanese language model].
		>It is important to have a large pipeline to the "AI that thinks across languages" that will grow more and more in the future.
  >"AI that thinks across languages" is like a newly discovered oil field, and value is gushing forth.
  >Users of languages with narrower pipes do not enjoy much of the value that comes out of this.
	[Will the performance improvement come to a head or will there be endless performance gains?]
		If there is a head start, then the "difference by size" in 1 shrinks.
	[Language dynamics].
　　Currently, performance is better when communicating with GPT4 in English than in Japanese.
	[Do we need a language model for Japanese?]
		>Talking about how "another smaller model" is futile, but we need a "tokenizer + alpha layer suitable for Japanese".


One solution is like this.

PS
　What if it's not a headache?
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1639213542296674305] If we assume that "the larger the scale of the training data, the higher the value", then the total amount of sentences written in Japanese is not comparable to the total amount of sentences written in English, and the difference in terms of the number of speakers will not decrease. If we assume that "the larger the scale of learning data, the higher the value", then the total volume of sentences written in Japanese is not equal to the total volume of sentences written in English, and the difference in terms of the number of speakers will not decrease.
　　Just as in the Meiji Era, "If we don't make English the official language, we're in trouble, aren't we?" as it was in the Meiji Era
　　　[English as an official language].
