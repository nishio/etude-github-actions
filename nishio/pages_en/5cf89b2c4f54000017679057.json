Distinguishing between direct touch and Pencil touch on the iPad
When looking at each touch in the touches event, there are two types: touchType == "direct" and touchType == "stylus". This distinguishes between the two.

Note that when I am emulating an iPad on the Chrome Developer Tools, and I am generating touch events with the mouse, touchType is not attached. I hope to eventually be able to emulate touchType == "stylus".

In the future, this may be compiled in [Pointer Events https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/], but at this time, it seems that the browser implementation has not progressed. [Pointer Events]
