Presentation Video Pre-Scrapbox Sharing Style
Online conference style where presentation videos are shared on Scrapbox in advance, allowing asynchronous comments and questions

brief description
　Presenter uploads video to YouTube a week before the event and puts it in Scrapbox
　　Can be public or unlisted
　Event participants watch that video during the week and write comments and questions in that Scrapbox.

　The project was tried and well received at the [Unexplored Junior 2021 Boost Conference].
　The above page was created as a way to record all the information before it is scattered, so there is too much information for a first-time visitor.
	[talk.cpp]
	　[/talkcpp/talk.cpp]
　　A technical event "talk.cpp" was organized through the same mechanism by Mr. Suzuki, a mentor who attended the Boost Conference.
　　Explanation of the case
　　>[* talk.cpp in 5 lines].
  > Presenters will have their presentation videos available at least one week prior to the event
  > Students will watch the video in advance of the event and will be ready for the day of the event
  > Students write questions and comments on the video in advance on Scrapbox
  > No video will be shown on the day of the event, but presenters will verbally + screen-share answers and other supplementary discussions based on questions and comments in the Scrapbox.
  > After the event, a discussion session via video call may be arranged
 　It's now easier to see the actual Scrapbox in a public place and get an idea of what it looks like.
