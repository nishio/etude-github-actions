Advanced Pasta Logic Rule: Avoid Draws
 Like a thousand-day move in chess, a situation may arise in which both parties choose the action they want to take and the situation remains exactly the same.
 The standard rules call for a draw.
 　This is because it is difficult to explain complicated tie-breaking rules to new players, but if both sides do not understand the rules properly, the unfamiliar side will feel uncomfortable that they have been beaten by a rule they do not understand.
 　Instead, it is a design decision to draw the game and play the next game immediately, which would be more fun per unit of time.
 On the other hand, we know that some people prefer rules with clear winners and losers. The author (Nishio) is one of them. Therefore, the rules during development defined a win/loss decision without a draw.
 This is presented as an advanced rule.

stalemate resolution rules
 If the same board situation as in the past is replayed during play at the same time that the execution of one flag is completed, either player can declare "this is a stalemate".
 When a stalemate is declared, the game ends immediately. At this time, the winner is determined by the following procedure: 1.
  The one with more lives wins.
  In case of a tie in life, the player with the most flags on the board wins.
  If there are the same number of flags, the one with the most flags placed at the top of the command card wins.
  If there is also a tie, the owner of the first flag that appears wins, looking for it from the position and orientation of the program counter at the start of the game.
