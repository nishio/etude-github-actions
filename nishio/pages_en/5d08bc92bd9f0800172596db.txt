Balloon Menu

	I want a balloon menu near the selection.
 I'd like to get it out,
 	Drawing a balloon menu."
 	The balloon menu will take any event that occurs on the canvas while the balloon menu is out."

	Menu items you would like to serve on the balloon menu
		Styling, cutting, copying, deleting, grouping
		Clicking on a sticky
			deletion
