Specific tags for all pages in Scrapbox
I wrote this because I wanted to create a project for English translation by adding a "translation yet" tag to all the pages of the Scrapboxed project of the Japanese version of Engineer's Intellectual Production Techniques. It's too simple to publish as a tool, so I'll put it here.

code:python
 import json
 data = json.load(open("/Users/nishio/Downloads/test-scrapbook-20181215.json"))
 for page in data["pages"]:
     page["lines"].extend(["", "[translation not yet]"])
 
 json.dump(data, open("out.json", "w"))
