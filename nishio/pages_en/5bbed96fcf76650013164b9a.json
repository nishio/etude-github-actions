Derailed class + one-way class = flipped class
[derailment] is "[unanticipated] topic development," and when the goal is to develop a topic, it is the same phenomenon as 1 of the 7 opportunities for innovation, "[unanticipated success]. On the other hand, in the [subtractive] evaluation, where there is a schedule and "it is negative if it is not done as planned," unexpected development is suppressed because it appears to be negative, taking resources away from what was planned.

For a fixed "[lecture]" with no unexpected developments, you can take a video and play it.
	Rather, there is an approach of watching the video and then coming to the class, which is what is called "flipped classroom".
 >In this type of class, students prepare for new learning content by watching video lessons, usually at home, and there is no lecture in the classroom; on the contrary, the teacher provides individualized instruction and students work with other students on assignments that would traditionally be considered homework.
