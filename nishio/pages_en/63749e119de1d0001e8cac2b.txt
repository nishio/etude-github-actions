Parable of the Sidewalks
During the meeting, I was answering a question from a newcomer, when someone who had been there before pointed out that it is not interesting when Dr. Nishio answers the points that everyone wants to hear head-on. This is quite an interesting incident.

The image that came to mind when I was thinking about what it means.

I want to go from start S to finish G.
	However, it is difficult to find a side road to the destination.
	So many people follow the path and go to dead end A.
	I'm having trouble with dead ends.""Which direction is G?" Many questions will be asked.
	But if you try to go from A to G, the pause is a bush.

The appropriate action in this case is not to answer the questions that come up.
	It's about putting signs on side streets and giving them an overhead "map" in advance.
