Missing yourself.

Few things reach the favor of many, but with the wise, it is the height of happiness. When one has done one's job, the general rule is to be indifferent. But there is a way to earn the reward of this favor. The sure way is to excel in one's duties and talents. Add to this an attitude of favoritism, and you reach the point where you become needed for your job, not where your job is needed for you. Some will give honor to their office, and some will do the opposite. It is not to the great advantage of the poor successor to make his predecessor look respectable. This does not mean that one is spared, but that the other is spared.
