 I was up early yesterday and today, waking up at 6:00 a.m.
 
 *1245533857* 3D printer
 I wonder if there is an upper limit to the number of polygons in the data. If we were to make a pentagonal shape that looks like a circle with a proper bulge and concavity, we would need about 13 polygons per piece, which is 1,430,000 polygons. I wonder if it will be OK.
 
 *1245537425*Virtual Star Description
 I made it because it is still difficult to convey the message in a written explanation:

 Venue Now. It is difficult to know when to give an explanation. If I start explaining at the moment they arrive, people who want to see the work without any preconceived notions will be troubled.
 
 
 And that's the other thing. Perhaps it is because I am an engineer, but I seem to estimate too highly the value of the pleasure I feel the moment I realize, "Ah, I see. I learned about <a href="http://shuheiyamada.com/">Shuhei Yamada</a>'s work yesterday when we were talking, and it was very interesting for me to hear what he intended when I thought, "I see," but he never wrote an explanation of what he was doing. I don't write explanations of "this is what it is. I guess I shouldn't be so active in explaining.
 
 *1245581165*(Preliminary report)We received the Jury's Special Award!
 Yesterday and today we exhibited at the <a href='http://www.tagboat.com/ngs/award/summer/2009/exhibition.html'>TAGBOAT SUMMER AWARD 2009</a>, and to our surprise, we received the Special Jury Award! I was so surprised! What a surprise! I heard that TAGBOAT will issue a news release tomorrow, so I'll post a link to it after that.

 <body>If you think about how it works, wouldn't you convert it to voxels once for all intents and purposes? <br>If so, it would be calculated offline, because polygon counts and such are nonsense. </body>

 <body>Hello. I am an exhibitor at the Summer Awards. I was exhibiting a painting that looked like a crazy rabbit next to a salamander. <BR>I tried to talk to him at the exhibition because I thought his portfolio text (Aesthetics of programmers, transforming it into art) was interesting, but he was talking to someone else and I lost the timing to talk to him and came back. <br>The exhibition had changed since I was first interested in it, so it was easier to understand. <BR>I was interested to see the works of Mondrian, which at first I could only recognize as Mondrian, but by narrowing down the works, I was able to better see his thinking and aesthetics as a mathematical equation. <br>This exhibition was a great learning experience for me, as I still lack the idea of objectivity in artwork. <br>I will continue to read your blog. </body> <br>I will continue to read your blog.

 <body>Thank you very much! <BR>The Mondrian-ish one has a very different atmosphere, so if you put them side by side, the content you want to convey will be blurred. I realized that it is better to narrow it down. </body> <br><br>Thank you!

 <body>Well, I thought that if the process of converting to voxels is done in the printer, too large data might not fit in the printer's memory, but apparently I don't have to worry about that. </body>.

 <body>I see. <br>Worst case scenario, if you do it like a Stream (which would be deathly slow), you can do it one slice at a time (like a PowerVR type tile). <br>I wonder how it is actually implemented? </body>
