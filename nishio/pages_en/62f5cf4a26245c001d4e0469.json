[Difference between "worrying" and "thinking
　There are people who are bothered but [don't] think about it.
　What is thinking?
　　[trying to create a bond]?
　Even if you haven't put it all together yet (i.e., you haven't discovered the bond), you can output it if you have collected the materials for the bond.
　　I can answer a large amount of cluttered data when asked to explain what is bothering me.
　　Some people can't answer, because they haven't thought it through.
　　Write down what's bothering you on a whiteboard, make sticky notes, etc.
　　We go seeking new information in the hope that the new information will combine with what we are currently thinking
　On the other hand, there are cases where people who "[don't] bother" are just jumping to the conclusion at hand without thinking it through.
