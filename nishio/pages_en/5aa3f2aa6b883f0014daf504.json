harmonize but do not agree (harmonise)
Article I of the Seventeen-Article Constitution. 604.
>I say, "Do not fight for harmony, for nobility, or for religion. Everyone has a faction. I am a little better. I am a father who does not obey his father. While we are in disagreement, we are neighbours. If you are not in agreement with your father, then you are not in agreement with your father. Nothing will ever be accomplished.
>The first principle is that harmony is the most precious thing, and that the absence of disobedience is the most important. Everyone has a party, but few are truly followers. Some do not conform to their fathers, and some do not conform to their neighbors. However, when the kami are at peace with each other and the servants are in harmony, and when they discuss matters, then the truth will naturally come through. Let nothing come to pass.
 Nishio Meaningful Translation
 	Be mindful of "harmony" and try not to be biased.
  People are quick to form factions and factions, and few people can see everything again. They do not obey their lord and fight with those around them.
  However, if we focus on "harmony" and engage in discussion, things will naturally move in the right direction.
 explanation
 	I have left the word "harmony" untranslated, but this does not mean that one should "read the air and get along with those around you," but rather that one should "strike a balance" by listening to those whose opinions differ from your own without being biased toward your own or those of those around you.
  The source of this phrase is Confucius' Analects (論語), the first millstone of Confucius' Analects, "有子曰 禮之用和爲貴" (To use propriety, one must value propriety in harmony).
  In the Analects of Confucius, it is said, "A prince may be harmonious, but not harmonious; a dwarf may be harmonious, but not harmonious. The expression, "A prince may be harmonious but not harmonious, and a dwarf may be harmonious but not harmonious," is also used in the Analects.
