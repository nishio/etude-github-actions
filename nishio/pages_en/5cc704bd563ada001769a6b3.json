X is still X
In the riddle "X is X, but what is X that is p(X)", the existence of the assumption that "X is generally ¬p(X)" and the induction by this riddle that "we are discussing only X that is generally ¬p(X)" are illogical to begin with. We were told that it would be fine to answer "it is X" to the question.

E.g., "Bread is bread, but what bread can't you eat?"
	The word "bread" tends to conjure up images of "bread" that can be eaten, but this is an illogical assumption, and in fact the word "bread" can also refer to "pan. In fact, the word "bread" can also refer to "pan".

Example: "A taiyaki is a taiyaki, but what is a taiyaki you can't eat?"
	The question says "taiyaki", so "taiyaki" must be true.
