Time spent editing the video
People often ask me, "How long does it take you to edit a video?" is often asked, which is the equivalent of "How long does it take you to write a program?" which is the equivalent of "How long does it take to write a program?" and is difficult to answer. We were talking about why that is, because the work has no clear boundaries, but people in the world don't want detailed information, they just want a rough order of magnitude, so I'll leave you with some rough information.

	8/23 3-4 hours, filming assembling and running the robot

	Moved to an inn for development camp
	15:30 Trying Premiere Rush, not so good [src https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10219078348566155]
		>I'm trying Premire Rush. If I want to chop from the top and discard the parts I don't want, this seems fine, but if I want to pick the best parts from a 3-hour video and make a 5-minute video, I want to pick the good parts and keep them as material, and then combine them to make a composition, but I want to use the timeline's I would like to pick out the best parts of a 3-hour video and make a 5-minute video by combining them.
	Longer dinners at inns, running robots, etc.
	20:00 Put Premiere Pro in and this feels good [src https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10219079267789135]
		>Premire Pro has the feature I was hoping for, "cut out a section from a longer video and put it on the timeline".
	21:00 I'll make a fast playback video for now [src https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/videos/10219079479674432/]
		What should I do with the clips in Premiere when I want to cut out a long video clip as a material, but want to try it out without using it?
	24:42 Not sure how to edit audio [src https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10219081063034015]
	26:42 I got one done for now [src https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10219081880694456]
		Shooting 3 hours, conception + editing 6 hours, approx.
