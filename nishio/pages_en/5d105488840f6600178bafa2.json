Drag stickies in and out of groups and rearrange them
from [Sticky note selection and compression UI design].
Dragging stickies in a group
		When a sticky in a group is grabbed and moved,
			Stickies appear in the group after the move.
			This is because a new sticky object is created when the sticky position is updated, and the group still has a reference to the old sticky object.
		I thought "dragging the front sticky while grouped moves the entire sticky", but it doesn't.
			I thought you should be able to move a nameplate sticky to a child in a group, and vice versa, and make a child in a group a nameplate sticky.
			Parallel movement can be done using the un-stickied area.
		Addition/deletion of stickies and replacement with nameplates
