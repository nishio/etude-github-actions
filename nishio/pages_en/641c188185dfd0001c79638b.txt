nomadic philosophy
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1638795656373612544] I would like to learn something like "nomadic philosophy" of [nomads] who do not settle down. Maybe it didn't stay in writing because they didn't want to carry something heavy like a philosophy book or something like that? But I'm sure there are researchers who went to check it out and wrote it down.
