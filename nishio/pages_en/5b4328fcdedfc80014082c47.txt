The ideas that you come up with, other people come up with.
 [Do not spoil the manufacturing mindset.]
 The idea that "if I can think of an idea, others have thought of it too."
 In fact, there are many.
 	In particular, "This is the problem in the world today, so I think it would be a good idea to solve it this way," which is not a 5-meter-long, desk-bound, fancy idea that diverges from one's own experience, has already been tried by someone else and found to be useless, and discarded.
 However, it's not good to think that "other people have come up with ideas that I can come up with," or that "it doesn't matter if I do my best.
 difficult
 I also feel that even if 99% of the ideas are shared with others, if there is a 1% chance that something new will come out of it, then we should encourge it.
 One way to make it less likely to be covered up is to make it tightly coupled with your own experience and your own environment.
 One way to develop the idea is to say, "Other people are coming up with ideas that I come up with," "But few people are putting them into practice," and "So I'm going to do it."
