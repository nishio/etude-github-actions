 It was the combustible trash. I left it at the front door, but forgot about it.
 
 *1194325537*About Create
 There are people in the world who are not creative, but there is no reason why all people have to be creative, so it is not creative to shout "Create! is not creative.
 For someone like me, who lives to create, it is hard to understand what on earth such people enjoy in life, but I guess everyone has different values.
 
 I wonder if the correct answer is not to collide head-on, nor to dodge, but to create by utilizing the opponent's strength, like in aikido.

         try: soc.connect(host_port)

             try: msg = arg[1]
             except: msg = arg
             self.send_error(404, msg)

 I think this is a 503, not a 404, but I'm not sure.

 *1194350853*Today's Summary
 Every day we should organize what we did that day and what we'll do tomorrow.
 - I could reverse proxy pluggable, but lxml made empty textarea tag <textarea/> by itself. textarea seems to be a tag that cannot omit closing tag, so all the following sentences are in textarea orz.
 - I don't have a problem with GET, but it sometimes goes wrong during POST. I have not yet been able to determine what the cause is.
 - If you put an unicode string in cStringIO, it will be cut off. You should use raw StringIO.
 
 Tomorrow is PHP day.
