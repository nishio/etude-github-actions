0.6mm, significantly reduced shoulder stiffness by applying to tender points without awareness of the acupuncture points

2022-01-04
 At first I bought 0.6mm and 0.9mm, but then I wanted to try something more stimulating, so I bought 1.2mm and 1.5mm
 The expression I saw in a review, "Recommended for those who want to push the stiffness with their fingers and 'push it deeper'" fits the description.
  If the surface is hard, acupressure cannot reach deep into the body.
  Apply a circular acupuncture needle to a hard area and after a while the area around the acupuncture needle will become warm and the surface stiffness will be relieved.
  　Perhaps the stimulation stimulates blood flow in the area.
 As the surface softens, you will be able to recognize areas of deep-seated stiffness
　Does 1.5mm hurt?
　　It doesn't hurt.
　　If you press down hard enough, it feels like you're pressing on a pressure point with a toothpick, but it disappears as soon as you relax.
　　The presence may be felt when the muscles are moved, for example, when you twist your waist, you may feel the needles in your lower back.
　　As for my neck and shoulders, they're stiff because I don't move them enough.
　　It hurts when I lie down and put my weight on it hitting my lower back.
