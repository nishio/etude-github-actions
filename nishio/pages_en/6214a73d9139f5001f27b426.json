Unlearning is necessary to enjoy
　Interesting story about Dominion's online competition.
　　No shuffling of decks or anything, just easy.
　Never seems to be a dull moment in old age.
　But there is an exception.
　　I like the feel of the paper! I don't care what you do online!" Don't say, "I don't like the feel of paper!
　　No one wants to play with such "[a] pain in the ass".
　　Things are changing rapidly, we need to enjoy the new things, not say the old things were good.
　similar story
　　King of Games (i.e. rock-paper-scissors game)
　　　These days things have changed a lot from the past.
　　　We have to forget about the old strong cards and learn the current strategies.
　　　[Unlearning] required
　　　There are those who say, "The old days were more interesting."
　　　People like that are shunned by people who don't know what they used to do.
　When I was into Dominion too, 12 years ago, before the alchemy expansion came out.
