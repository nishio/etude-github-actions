Cash is weak capital
Cash is weak capital.
Put another way, cash is not universal capital.
There are some things that cannot be obtained by cash.

["Even if I got zero compensation, I was doing double work." https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m001358.html]
Some people see this title and interpret it to mean "I don't want compensation".
However, "no consideration" and "consideration need not be in the form of cash" are two different stories.

If you don't understand the idea that cash is weak capital, you misunderstand that cash can be exchanged for anything.
If you misunderstand that, you will not understand the meaning of "consideration need not be in the form of cash".
They fail to understand that even if they offer cash as consideration, they may be kicked out with the question, "Don't you have a better consideration than cash?

 >I agree with the first half of the argument, and I don't have any strong objection to the last point above, but there is a considerable distance between what I want to say in the first half and the last point (although they are connected).
I thought this point made sense, but at the time I didn't understand the connection.
After reading this for the first time in a year, I thought this was the reverse of the sentence sequence.
The first half does not lead to "cash is very weak capital" but "cash is very weak capital" leads to the first half.
