attack a plot
weigh the relative merits of A and B
>The upper army is cutting down plans, the lower army is cutting down communications, the upper army is cutting down soldiers, and the lower army is attacking the fortress.
	[Sun Tzu] [Plot and Attack]
	It is best to nullify the opponent's schemes
 The next best thing is to stand in fellowship and isolate yourself.
 Beating soldiers is worse than that.
 Among other things, attacking a castle that is well defended by the opponent is the worst, and only when it is unavoidable.
