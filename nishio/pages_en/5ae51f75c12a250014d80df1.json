attack a plot
weigh the relative merits of A and B
>上兵伐謀、其次伐交、其次伐兵、其下攻城
	[孫子] [謀攻篇]
	It is best to nullify the opponent's schemes
 The next best thing is to stand in fellowship and isolate yourself.
 Beating soldiers is worse than that.
 Among other things, attacking a castle that is well defended by the opponent is the worst, and only when it is unavoidable.
