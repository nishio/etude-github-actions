noblesse oblige
https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ノブレス obrige

I wrote noblesse oblige in [I have received charity from the world, so I should also give charity to the world],
By the way, after I wrote it, I thought about it, but I think there's a lame way to call yourself noble and a lame way to say that you're [obligated] to do something that you don't really want to do, but you don't really have a choice.

People who feel that gravity is natural do not feel "obligated to be restrained in their vertical movement by weight on the ground."
