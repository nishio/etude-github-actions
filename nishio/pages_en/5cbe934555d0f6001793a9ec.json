Owned media create a common language.
Information sent out by owned media can be "found" through search.
That will help in creating a common language.
Example: [Freedom and Independence].

It feels like an organization enhanced by information processing technology, where employees are discussing internal culture in an open forum, and there are references that are open, and you can find them with [search] and point to them with [permalink].

I think the principle of "[fairness]" underlies the question, "Why are we discussing this in an open forum?"

[Owned media] creates a [common language].
