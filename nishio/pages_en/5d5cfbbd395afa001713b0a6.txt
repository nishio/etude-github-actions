Avoid evaluation by sum and cross
	In [Evaluating by Sum, Generalists are Selected], I wrote that if you want to adopt a specialist, you should not select him or her by summing the scores of several judges.
	In [Niche Top Strategy for Cross-fertilization], I wrote about how having multiple specialties can create value through cross-fertilization.

	The former is a phenomenon that in a [two-dimensional standard normal distribution], Mr. B is chosen over Mr. A, who is the sharpest in the total score.

	The latter is not the case.
		Especially when the axis is widely known, many people will apply optimization in the direction of that axis
		Then people will be distributed thickly around the axis.
		The mixing area becomes a blank space.

		Under these circumstances.
			A, with his keen ability, is of course valuable.
			Talk about comparing B and C.
				Mr. C with average ability on X-axis
				Mr. B, who is inferior to Mr. C on the x-axis but has moderate ability on the y-axis
				In a comparison of the two, Mr. B tends to win in business terms.
				While Mr. B can promote the value of "bridging the X and Y axes", Mr. C cannot.
				Mr. C tries to appeal his ability on the X axis, but that's average, so he can't use it as a point of appeal.

	The statistically natural hypothesis is the former figure, where the X and Y axes are independently normally distributed, but observing reality, the latter is more plausible.
		Why is that?
		Is it strange to think that it's [normally distributed]?
		Even in situations where it is reasonable to invest in the second axis, many people seem to stick to the first axis to which they are accustomed
			[You'd be better off investing in a new S-curve].
		Why does it happen?
