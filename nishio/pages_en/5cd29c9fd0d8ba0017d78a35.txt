	I love [tulips].
		The Arabic word for the tulip "Laleh" is Lam - Elif - Lam - He
		The only God Allah is expressed in Arabic as Elif - Lam - Lam - He
		This is where the idea of associating the tulip with God came from.
	Tulips are exported to the Netherlands.
		Tulips Boom in the Netherlands
		Huge wealth from breeding and re-exporting to the Ottoman Empire!
		Tulips become the subject of speculation, leading to a tulip bubble
		>In the Federal Republic of the Netherlands during the Dutch Golden Age, the price of tulip bulbs, which had just been brought from the Ottoman Empire at the time, rose abnormally high and then suddenly fell.

	[Cleanliness is half of faith.]
	The Ottoman Empire issued a request for Chinese celadon porcelain to be "tulip-patterned".
		circa 1700
		Before he ordered the pattern, he thought the celadon was "an unusual vessel, but the pattern is poor," so he decorated it with gold and rubies to make it look more cozy.
			I'm keenly aware that different cultures have different aesthetic senses.
	Muhammad's sweat smells like roses.
		The white rose was born of Muhammad's sweat.
		Make rose water and pour it over the guests.

		[The first goodwill mission of the Ottoman Empire to Japan.
		The 46-year-old wooden ship met a typhoon on its way home and was lost off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture [Kii Oshima - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%80%E4%BC%8A%E5%A4%A7%E5%B3%B6].
		The donations sent in response to the war increased pro-Japanese sentiment in Turkey, and led to the rescue of 215 Japanese nationals in Iran at the beginning of the Iran-Iraq War by [Turkish Airlines].
	Hmm? Tulip Bubble? Emperor Meiji?
		The Ottoman Empire lasted a crazy long time, 1299 - 1922.
		In 1299, Japan was in the Kamakura period. 1922 was the Taisho era.
	Being Muslim, I imagined an abstract mosaic, but there were surprisingly few like that.
		So tulips don't constitute idolatry.
		Designing letters as [hanaseki] was done.
