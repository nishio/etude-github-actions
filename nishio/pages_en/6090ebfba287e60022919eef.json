 *1227675010* Yamanote Line (3rd day)
 Shinagawa → Tamachi → Hamamatsucho → Shinbashi → Yurakucho → Tokyo → Kanda → Akihabara → Okachimachi → Ueno → Uguisudani → Nippori → Nishinippori → Tabata → Komagome → Sugamo → ? →Ikebukuro → Mejiro → Takadanobaba → Shin-Okubo → Shinjuku → Yoyogi → Harajuku → Shibuya → Ebisu → Meguro → Gotanda → Osaki → Shinagawa
 
 Ah, what is that between Sugamo and Ikebukuro? What is that thing where the streetcar Toei Arakawa Line intersects?
 
 
 Grading. Ahhhh, Otsuka, 28/29. That was so close! I was going to answer correctly here and do the next problem.
 The station is located between Sugamo and Ikebukuro, and the reason why the name "Ootsuka" was not mentioned was that it was a lost cause.
 Memorizing the names of symbols is hard to pull from memory, like peripheral information. It would be nice if there was a word association or origin. I don't know the origin of the name, but the place where Otsuka Station on the Yamanote Line is located was Sugamo Village when it was built, and the actual Otsuka is about 1 km to the south. Otsuka is home to Ochanomizu University, which is not located in Ochanomizu Station. It is located at 2-1-1 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo.

 I had drawn this far yesterday, but completely forgot to press the "Save" button.
 
 Today's Test
 Shinagawa → Osaki → Tamachi → Hamamatsucho → Shinbashi → Yurakucho → Tokyo → Kanda → Akihabara → Okachimachi → Ueno → Uguisudani → Nippori → Nishinippori → Tabata → Komagome → Sugamo → Osaki → Ikebukuro → Mejiro → Takadanobaba → Shin-Okubo → Shinjuku → Yoyogi → Harajuku → Shibuya → Ebisu → Meguro → Gotanda → Shinagawa
 
 Oops, for some reason it says "Osaki" where "Otsuka" is. Moreover, the position of Osaki has been switched with Shinagawa.

 <BODY>How about a replacement song? <BR>With a single steam whistle melody, it can be sung counterclockwise from Tokyo. The end does not go in neatly. My elementary school students often sing along. <BR>The melody is from Seto no Bride and can be sung clockwise from Shibuya. This one will fit nicely. <br>Both of these are a bit forced, but they stand on their own in a manner of speaking. </body>
