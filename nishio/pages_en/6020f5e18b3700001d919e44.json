The browser precedes the request with the OPTIONS method.
The server is returning a 308 Permanent Redirect for the request and is therefore not considered CORSable.

cause
　Server side
　	`@app.route('/api/web/create/', methods=["GET"])`
　client-side
		`fetch(APIROOT + "web/create", {...})`
　So this is redirecting access without the trailing slash to a URL with one.

solution
　`fetch(APIROOT + "web/create/", {...}) I just did `and it solved the problem.
