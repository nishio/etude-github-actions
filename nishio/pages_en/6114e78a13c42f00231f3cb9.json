>1,160 of 1,983 patients in the Tokyo Fire Department area who were infected with a new type of coronavirus and whose symptoms worsened while recovering at home, etc., and who requested emergency transport during the week of March 16-22, were not transported to the hospital.

I would say that just under 90% of those who tested positive were homebound or adjusted, and of those 30,000 to 40,000 people, 2,000 called for emergency medical care, so about 6%, and of those 60% were not transported.
