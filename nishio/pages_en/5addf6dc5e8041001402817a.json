Generalists are selected when evaluated by sum
 When multiple tests and multiple judges' scores [are evaluated by summing], a person with better overall ability is rated higher than a person who excels only in some abilities.
 Therefore, they choose [generalist] instead of [specialist]. ref. [Specialist and generalist].
 If you want to hire specialists, [sharp people], don't make that kind of selection.

On the right is the contour line when evaluated by the sum of the two test scores, and on the left is the contour line when evaluated by the maximum of the two test scores.
The evaluation of Mr. A, who scored 60 points in both abilities, and Mr. B, who excelled in one ability, are reversed.

 [Harmonious average to get the sharpest talent]
  This is an evaluation strategy for cases where absolute evaluation scores, such as tests, are not given, but only rank ratings are obtained.

What prompted me to write this article
 [We want to raise the top 1% of children in Japan - a look behind the scenes of "Unexplored Junior" https://lab-on.jp/academia/1202/] [Unexplored Junior]
	>--When I hear the word "[unexplored]", I get the impression that the projects selected are all of a high level. Please tell us about the criteria for the selection of the submitted ideas.
 > In the selection process for [Unexplored Junior], each PM decides on the selection of a project from the perspective of "whether or not I want to work with this child. After screening the application documents, each PM conducts a 30-minute online interview with the applicant whose idea they are interested in, and decides whether or not the project will be adopted. Since each PM evaluates applicants from different perspectives and based on different criteria, there is not much overlap among PMs in the number of applicants they nominate for interviews.
 > -- I was surprised. I had imagined that all the PMs would evaluate all the ideas and adopt the applicants in order from the top to the bottom, using a point scoring system.
	Specialists should not be selected in such a way.
 Also, "[the] scoring system" does not mean adding up multiple evaluations.
 	Ignore the bad and focus on the good.
  On the right side of the above figure, when evaluating the sum of x and y, A (60, 60) has 120 points and beats B (100, 0)'s 100 points because B's -100 is not ignored when comparing A (-40, -40) and B (0, -100), which is a subtraction from 100 points.
  In other words, using addition to combine multiple evaluations is a neutral method that is neither additive nor subtractive.
  max(x, y) is an additive method that ignores bad points, min(x, y) is a subtractive method that ignores good points

PS
	[/masui/ sum and average].
	 Taking the sum is the same as [taking the average] (the rank is exactly the same because you just divide by a constant).

	Since [majority rule] is to take the greatest sum of each person's 0/1 ratings added together, the "sum rating" at issue here
