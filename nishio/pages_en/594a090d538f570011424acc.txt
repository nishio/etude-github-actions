Scientific Values and Personal Happiness
Scientific values are about unlocking universal truths.
I'm not really interested in whether or not any one individual is happy.
There is no guarantee that the values individuals use to determine their actions will be the same as scientific values
Rather, in many cases, there is a discrepancy.
