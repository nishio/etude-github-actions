In the [adversarial generative network]([GAN]), the generative network outputs forgeries and the discriminative network identifies the authenticity of that output.
At this time, the generative network [mimics].

If this generative network has sufficient expressive power, it can perfectly mimic the original given as training data. At this time, the discriminative network will not be able to identify it.
So we expect to learn a "reasonable balance" by making the loss function common and optimizing it at the same time.

After learning enough about this, add "[desire for independence] network".

It determines how far the output of the generative network is "from what is given as a sample". The farther away, the better the score.
However, at the same time, the discriminative network determines whether the output is within the subspace represented by the given sample, so if the output is too far away from the sample, the score of the discriminative network will decrease.
This produces "something that does not resemble the sample data, but is in the space represented by the sample data.
