Condition when it arises
Translation of Latin origin [In statu nascendi

To understand a concept, it is good to look closely at the "state of affairs when it arose"
　Because it is the closest in terms of "mental state before the concept is acquired".
　Over time, abstraction and expansion of meaning become more difficult to understand

relevance
　[A relationship found after an expanded interpretation is not necessarily a relationship to the original concept].
　[Books are already a product of abstraction], so we've moved a bit away from the state of affairs when the concept arose.
　　Supplement with specific episodes of the author's life.
　　　But I can't always do it because I can't write the story or it doesn't fit the volume.
　　I'll approximate it with a parable.
　　[coined based on unshared experience].
