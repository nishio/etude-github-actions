There are two ways to behave toward new things
There are two types of behavior when confronted with a new tool.

Some people say, "Wow, what's this, how does it work?" or "What, you can do that? How do you do that?" and then they quickly learn how to use the tool and [enjoy] using it.

Another person feels [dissatisfied] by saying, "What's this, I don't understand it," or "It's not good, this part is not good, it should be improved," and is satisfied by arguing with someone who feels the same thing, saying, "This is not good.

It was very impressive to observe both those who were enjoying and those who were frustrated using the same tool for the first time in the same way.
