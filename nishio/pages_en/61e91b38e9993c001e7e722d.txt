(3.6) Summary
In this chapter, we learned about memory. The part of the brain called hippocampus, which rats use to memorize place, is also used when human create long-term memory. Unlike storing a file on a computer, it is necessary for the brain to repeat like muscle training.

Repetition is important. However, it is not to read books repeatedly, to test your memory repeatedly. When you do the review test, subjective confidence decrease but objective results increase. Computers can assist to adjust the repetition interval of the test and the difficulty level of the test. There are not many learning materials presupposed to utilize such a mechanism. Making your own material referring to the 20 rules is useful to strengthen your memory.

In the next chapter, we learn about reading, which is the preceding step of the memorization.
