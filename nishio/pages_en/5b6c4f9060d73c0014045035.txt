Older Mounting
I have seen people say things like, "It takes five years to master something," but if they have been consciously working on mastering it, but they have only been doing it for five years, isn't it just "mounting" to say that to someone who hasn't been doing it for five years, "I am better than you because I have more experience than you"? I have more experience than you, so I am better than you.

Even if it took you 5 years of conscious effort to master it, any sane person would express "it took me 5 years to master it," and it is simply [an overgeneralization] to [generalize] as if it takes everyone 5 years. The fact that it took you personally so long to learn is a sign of your incompetence, so why you are so high and mighty is a mystery. Are you unable to [relativize] yourself?

The speed at which things are learned is greatly affected by enthusiasm, and when someone is enthusiastic about learning something, isn't it harmful behavior to say something like, "It will take five years"?
