Explanation of the mechanism
[https://gyazo.com/f95424776b71baab159b79b6fddbe54e]

　Custom model items are placed in an invisible picture frame.
　As for the chairs, they are placed on top of invisible blocks (barriers) because there is a need to "sit on top of them".
　In the illustration image above, the bottom of the laptop is also invisible blocked, but this is usually done on a desk, etc.

Invisible picture frames can be obtained with the following commands
	code:command
	 give @p item_frame{EntityTag:{Invisible:1b}}
If you are not used to installing an invisible picture frame, you can install a visible frame and then change it to invisible.
 code:command
  data modify entity @e[type=minecraft:item_frame, nbt={Invisible:0b}, limit=1, sort=nearest] Invisible set value 1b
