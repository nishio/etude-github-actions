Programs that make the subject matter larger
	>"I see, it's a useful human hack!" when I saw a tweet that "[large subject lines] are more likely to get a response. I thought, "But if I do that myself, people will think I'm a person with a big subject line, and my reputation will drop, so I need to create a bot that automatically makes the subject line bigger.
	>I was joking about the "subject magnification filter", but I thought it was rather amusing lol.
	>I could have predicted that if you send a DM to a bot, it would tweet with a larger subject line, and that an angry person would DM a complaint without reading the explanation and it would also be tweeted with a larger subject line.
		>In English conversation lessons, I remember that I was so lacking in [vocabulary] that I abused "people" and used the expression "people are" a lot, and the subject was too big and I got myself stuck in the spotlight.
