The tree does not correctly represent the structure of the natural product.
>The tree is an orderly and beautiful way of thinking and provides a simple and clear way to divide a complex whole into units, but it does not do justice to the structure of a naturally formed city, nor does it depict the structure of the city as we need it to be.
	[The city is not a tree] [Christopher Alexander].

	I wonder if the naturally formed "knowledge" is not a [tree] as well.
	Only those structured [top-down] by one or a few people are tree
	A tree is not a tree if a lot of people have come together to make it.
		If you try to describe it as if it were a tree, you distort it.
	Made top-down v.s. made by the many â†’ [Kyan and bazaar]-like metaphor
