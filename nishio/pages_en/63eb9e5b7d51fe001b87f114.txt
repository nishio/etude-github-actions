What is this?
This is [Yasukazu Nishio's] personal [Scrapbox].

[*** What is Scrapbox?]
 It's a place to store and put information.
　Unlike a blog, the main [reader is you].
　　You [may read, but you don't have to].
 More fine-unit fragments than a blog.
 　[It is closer to the image of "information cards" introduced by Tadao Umesao in "The Art of Intellectual Production.
　　　Many authors, not just him, have used similar mechanisms.
　　　It was written on paper and placed in a private study, which only he could see.
　　　Not the final work, but to assist the person in the intellectual production of the work at the stage of creating it.
　　What is placed on this site can be interpreted as an information card that Yasukazu Nishio uses for his own intellectual production
　　I've been using it for about 5 years now and have 14,000 cards.
 Scrapbox is vastly superior to paper information cards.
 　A [knowledge network] is represented by a mechanism that [structures information using links].
 　[Unexpected links] and [Scrapbox's suggestions are useful] help me discover pages I've written in the past.
　 　[Comparing similarities is a way to learn something new].

[*** Guide for New Scrapbox Readers].
　The best way is to use Scrapbox myself.
　　I've written a lot of explanations in words here, but [the improved skill of using tools makes the perception of the world more detailed], so the understanding of those who don't use them doesn't come to those who do.
　　When you search within your own Scrapbox project, a cross search is also performed on the Scrapbox projects you have viewed, giving you the opportunity to discover other people's ideas about what you are thinking

	Meaning of the color of the links in the page
  Red links are "doors that don't lead anywhere yet" and therefore not useful to click on.
   Think of it as highlighting keywords.
  Blue links are links to other pages in Scrapbox
  　This page is often empty
  　Useful even when empty, as a list of "pages linked to that keyword" is carded at the bottom of the page
  　Example: [Philosophy of [/shokai/Scrapbox]]
  　　This is a link to Scrapbox's "Other Projects" page
  　　This example links to a page in the shokai project that is developing Scrapbox
  Blue underlined links are links outside Scrapbox

	Meaning of the green and gray lines on the left edge of the page
 	They are called "telomeres." For a detailed description, see [/shokai/telomere].
  Unread lines (= lines that have been updated since the last visit) are green
		The more recently updated, the thicker.
  Click here to get the permalink to the line so you can mention it.

　Q: Where do I start reading?
　　Option 1: Search for keywords of your interest
　　Option 2: Follow the links by clicking on the links that interest you at the bottom of each page.
　　　We have a starting point for readers here: [Links for Readers].
