Homogeneous, obedient and diligent factory labor â†’ Diverse, autonomous and creative human resources
>Since the 1980s, Japanese industry has sought human resources with qualities and abilities such as "independence," "problem-setting and problem-solving skills," and "knowledge and education that transcend the boundaries between the arts and sciences.
> However, while learning opportunities for their development have not been adequately developed, the shortage of such human resources is becoming increasingly serious in the face of structural changes such as DX, decarbonization, and the Corona disaster underway.
> These qualities and abilities are to be nurtured from the elementary and secondary education stage, and the current Courses of Study indicate the same direction, but the shift from a modern education system whose strength was in nurturing a "homogeneous, obedient, and diligent factory workforce" to a new learning system that fosters "[diverse, autonomous, and creative human resources]" is a long way off .
