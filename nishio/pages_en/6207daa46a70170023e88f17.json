A game with a [Factorio]-like setting in which you crash-land alone on an uncharted planet to build an automation device. The world is characterized by arbitrarily shaped polygons instead of grids and blocks. The ground can be dug, raised, and leveled.

The resources that can be extracted vary depending on the planet and mining depth, so there is a high need for exploration. It is not possible to be away from the lifelines of electricity and oxygen for long periods of time, so it is like exploring and cultivating while exploring.

Maybe the [Terraria]-like characteristics are stronger?
