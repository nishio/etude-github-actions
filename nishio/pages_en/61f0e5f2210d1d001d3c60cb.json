rootless grass
the Bible: Matthew 13-5~6
>5 Other seeds fell on ground which had rocks. There was not much soil in that place. The seeds quickly began to grow, because the soil was not deep. 
> 6 But when the sun rose, it burned the young plants. They soon died because they had not grown down well into the soil.
