[SSR]: [Server Side Rendering]

 	>[Prerendering]
  > Our blog is set up, but crawlers from search engines and social networks don’t always execute JavaScript so our blog has terrible SEO.
  > There are a number of ways to address this, including setting up server-side rendering and pre-rendering services like Prerender.io. But these options all require setting up and maintaining a Node.js server. Luckly, Netlify offers built-in prerendering which allows us to keep our code “serverless” while still making sure our blog is optimized for crawlers.
