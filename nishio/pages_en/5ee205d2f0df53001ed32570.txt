I don't read the meaning behind it.
Even if a social networking service that filters [slander] is created, it is unlikely to be able to filter words with [hidden meaning], such as "You're getting really good at playing the piano" (= piano sound is too loud).

The attacker's intention to "convey negative emotions" cannot be accomplished if they are not conveyed. Therefore, interpreting and responding literally is an efficient defense.

I wish I could have lived like you."
　→Thank you!
You're getting better at the piano."
　→Thank you!

I think a simple "thank you" would do the trick.

If someone attacks you in a backhanded way, and you receive the backhanded meaning and are hurt, the attacker will feel that he has "succeeded" in his attack and will repeat the same attack. Do not give the attacker a success story.

Also, for your own protection, do not accept the underlying meaning.
If you keep interpreting compliments in the [reverse meaning], when you are really being praised, you may think, "It's strange that I am being praised, or that you are actually blaming me," and you may feel hurt on your own.
Reading into what is not said without permission is [paranoid] and betrays the speaker's positive praise.

When you receive a positive message
　If the other party is really positive
　　A simple "thank you" is all that is needed.
　When in fact, negativity is implied.
　　We don't like to succeed in that kind of communication, so ignore the negative intent and return with a "thank you".
→ As a result, there is no need to identify which is the other party's intention, and it is correct to react with a literal interpretation

relevance
　[Ignore the slander and move on to success.]
　Symptoms of not being able to accept compliments honestly are similar to [Imposter Syndrome].
