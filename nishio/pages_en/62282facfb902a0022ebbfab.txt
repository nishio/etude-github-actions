Who knew the knowledge and who made it.
A person A who created some knowledge X as a result of thinking about it, and a person B who saw it and knew that "it already exists." and person B who saw it and knew that "it is already there".

Person A who made it has a [knowledge network].
　The X that floats on the surface of the water is the result, there is a lot of thinking going on below the surface.
　There's a stack of [pyramids of knowledge].

Not sure if person B who knew has a [knowledge network].
　Can present [relevant knowledge] if any.
　　A "I think it's like this" B "Oh, it's a concept called X, and you can use it to draw the conclusion that, for example, choice Z is better in situation Y."
　People who cannot present relevant knowledge
　　Raises suspicion that there may be no network

　　Not [knowledge producers] but [knowledge consumers].
	[easy to say after seeing]: [Columbus' egg].

Why does B sometimes act like a big jerk to A?
　has demonstrated that A has [the ability to produce knowledge], whereas B has not.
　The world as a whole would be richer if resources were concentrated in A.
　　Since the knowledge generated by A enriches the future B
　It is better to give more and more [peripheral knowledge] so that A's production capacity is not consumed by "reproduction of what has already been produced".
　　A B that can do that is a "good B."
　　B who cannot do it but makes statements that discourage A is a "bad B."
　　Bad B's are harmful to the world.
　　　Because of the personal greed of personal pride, we are dragging the producers down and undermining the public interest.
