[nishio.icon]This is a painting that came out this morning in the course of my 1,500 daily gacha drawings on my gaming PC. The strange composition with the body disconnected, the colors and touches are all so René Magritte that I think people will be fooled if I mix them in a book of his paintings.

	I didn't know Gertrude Abercrombie, but I'll add her to the query candidates.

[human.icon]Oh, the name of a painter that Nishio-san doesn't know is generated? That's amazing!

[nishio.icon]I'm using René Magritte as the prompt, but img2prompt is only given the generated image and doesn't know the original prompt information, so I decided that Gertrude Abercrombie is the closest to it.
