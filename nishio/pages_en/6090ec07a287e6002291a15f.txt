 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/gasso/20110324'>The folly of safety awareness - in fact, it's a mentality at the end of the day. </a>
 
 That's true. People like me have a habit of assuming that the information we are given is correct. In school education, we are expected to calculate and answer the given questions without doubts, but in the real world, it is not always correct. There are many cases that were not correct (e.g., organic mercury, asbestos, etc.).
 
 I've written about the results of various calculations so far, but we must remember that they are all based on the working hypothesis "if the information provided is correct".
 
 
 I also thought, "I want as much raw, uninterpreted information as possible," but that's because I can interpret it myself, and most people in the world are like, "The TV is speaking incomprehensible words! It's scary!" Most of the people in the world feel "TV is speaking incomprehensible language! I guess it depends on each person whether they think, "Therefore, it is necessary to talk about interpretation in easy-to-understand language," or "Therefore, it is counterproductive to give accurate information to idiots, and information control is necessary.
