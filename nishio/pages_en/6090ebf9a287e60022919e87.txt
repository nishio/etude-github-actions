 *1217426898*Gauche On QuickSilver was put in.

 Something that might be useful!
 
 After installing the plugin, I noticed that gauche was not installed, so I hurriedly installed it, but only Large Type was displayed. I restarted QuickSilver.
 
 magic spell
 cp -R ~/Library/Application\ Support/Quicksilver/PlugIns/Gauche\ Module.qsplugin/Contents/Frameworks/Gauche.framework /Applications/Quicksilver.app/Contents/Frameworks/
 failed. I wondered why, but my QuickSilver was in Downloads, not Application, since I installed it when I first started using a Mac a few days ago!
 
 I fixed that area, used magic spells, and still only had Large Type, and when I was thinking that I had to use TAB to move to the right action and then fidget with the cursor, it came up!
 
 -----
 PS
 I used to think it was a hassle to scroll all the way down after moving with TAB, but now I can just press "e" and the eval will be selected. Convenient, convenient. I've been using Python's interactive shell to do calculations, but from now on I'll use GoQS.
 
 
 And if I press CC or something, it will be Copy to Clipboard.
 
 *1217432892*[TopCoder] Preparing to play with Eclipse CDT
 What we did.
 - Create a TopCoder project in Eclipse
 - Set the directory where source code templates are output to the TopCoder workspace in the Arena plugin settings.
 - Eclipse does not wrap lines, so it is very difficult to see the problem text. http://ahtik.com/blog/2006/06/18/first-alpha-of-eclipse-word-wrap-released/ is inserted. It breaks the highlighting a little, but you can't give up.
 - Copy toolbox.cpp with utility functions for yourself
 - Passing through not passed through Boost, you can specify command line arguments in the Setting of C++ Build in Property.
 - In Emacs, I had set up the appropriate template to be inserted when I press TAB on for or size, so I tried to do the same in Eclipse, but...hmmm...when I write something like size_t ${N} = ${xs}.size(); in the template, it says that N is an undefined variable. I get an error message that N is an undefined variable. The help page seems to say I can use it. Also, I don't know how to make it a candidate for completion. Hmmm.
 - Most seriously, I get a mysterious error at line 0 and cannot build.
 
 
 Mwah, I guess I'll be competing tomorrow with Emacs.

 <body>You can use it even more conveniently by setting up a trigger key. â†’http://practical-scheme.net/wiliki/wiliki.cgi?naoya_t%3aMacOSX%3aQuicksilver%e3%81%a7Gauche%e3%82%92%e4%bd%bf%e3%81%8a%e3%81%86< http://blog.livedoor.jp/naoya_t/archives/51004764.html</body>
