Lifelog Microphone
	Concept of [Lifelog Camera
 But when I think about it, I have a strong interest in information being [digitized] and later [searchable].
 Isn't what we need a lifelogging microphone, not a lifelogging camera?
 A system that automatically [transcribes] what is said orally and makes it searchable.
 Should [Recoco] be running all the time?
