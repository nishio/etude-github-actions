Do not close Scrapbox tabs
	When newly opened, it takes a while before it appears.
 I have a habit of closing tabs when I'm done working, but with [Scrapbox] it might be better to leave them alone.
 But if I have multiple projects open in tabs, I can't tell which tab is which project.
 Is that the problem with having too many tabs open so that you can only see the icons?
