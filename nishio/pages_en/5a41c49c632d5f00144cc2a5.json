Steiner tree
>A Steiner tree is an undirected graph G=(V,E) consisting of a set of edges E and a set of nodes V. Given a subset T of V, a Steiner tree is a tree containing all the nodes in T. From the definition, it is clear that a Steiner tree is a [global tree] when T=V.

　The [Minimum Steiner Tree] problem is a loosening of the [Minimum Global Tree] problem so that not all vertices need to be connected.
	[Dreyfus-Wagner]
		Time complexity O(n 3^t + n^2 2^t + n^3)
		Implementation [Spaghetti Source - Smallest Steiner Tree http://www.prefield.com/algorithm/dp/steiner_tree.html]
	 The limit is about the required vertex t = 11
　When there are many required vertices and few optional vertices, there is a move to search all optional vertex selections
