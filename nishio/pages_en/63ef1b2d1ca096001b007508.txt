from [/villagepump/Bing AI to answer questions based on specific Scrapbox contents].

Please give specific examples of false dichotomies. Answer the question based on the contents of scrapbox.io/nishio.
[Bing.icon]
	A false dichotomy is a type of illogical fallacy that forcibly divides things into two and then proceeds to ignore all other possibilities. For example, "If you don't join us, you're the enemy," without taking into account that there are neutral positions or other alternatives.
	Based on the contents of scrapbox.io/nishio, here are some specific examples
		The false dichotomy of programmer/non-programmer. Programming skills and experience are gradations and have no clear boundaries.
		The false dichotomy of beneficial/non-beneficial. The value of research and learning depends on the purpose and perspective, and may be beneficial in the future.
		The false dichotomy of "can/cannot be used for military purposes". The "can/cannot be used for military purposes" argument is meaningless, since information science can be used in all fields that deal with information.
		False true-false dichotomy that f(x) is greater than 0 or not. Whether f(x) is greater than 0 depends on the value of x, and there are cases where f(x) is equal to 0.
	These are specific examples of false dichotomies.

　Looks like they're picking "cards that seem relevant" out of a bunch of links.
　　I'm mentioning the ones I chose from the top.

	>Research and learning can be valuable and potentially beneficial in the future, depending on one's goals and perspectives.
	　I agree with your assertion, but it doesn't say that, where did it come from?

		I agree with this conclusion, but you read it well.

	 > and f(x) may be equal to 0.
		Logically correct, but I think the equivocation is off-topic right now.

　Impressions[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　It's like "a relatively smart person reads five or so pages of my Scrapbox and summarizes it rather accurately."
　　I'm not myself, so there may be what I consider "unimportant" content mixed in.
　　Treat others with the mindset that they will never live up to your expectations 100% of the time, and that's normal.
　　　When you think of them as human beings, "I can make a request anytime, even late at night, and get a report of this quality back within a few minutes," it's a terrible quality.
　　　It's almost like the analogy of [a librarian being home 24 hours a day].
