 I tried my best to put it on the wall.

 A4 paper was projected to show the size.

 It was impossible to put it on the wall, so I put a magnet on the cardboard on the wall and pinned it with magnetic force.

 The moiré is amazing when this image is reduced in Spaces! I don't know what the conditions are to reproduce the amazing moiré.

 Today's Shopping List
 - TD62083AP 1 pc: Darlington sink driver
 - TD62783APG 2 pcs: Darlington Source Driver
 - 74HC595 3 pcs: Shift register
 - 165 Ohm 8 pcs: resistors for green LED
 - 145 Ohm 8 pcs: Resistor for red LED
 - 157 Ohm 1 pc: for LED of heart rate sensor
 - 80 Ohm 10 pcs: for high brightness white LEDs
 - 8 Ohm 1 pc: for when all high-brightness white LEDs are attached at once
 - 1k, 10k 100k, 0.1microF, 0.01microF as appropriate
 - Buy another breadboard because you need enough new space for 6 ICs to fit on it.
 Well, there will never be a perfect value for resistance, so I plan to make it appropriate.
 
 memo
 - USB voltage 5V±5%, current consumption 500mA, power consumption 2.5W

 List of today's purchases
 
 - breadboard
 -- SRH-5 x2 510 yen
 -- SRH-10 @920 x2: 1840 yen
 It was a failure. The length was different from the E-CELL's I had from the beginning and did not mesh, the gap between the +/- line and the zone with lots of holes was too big, and it was hard to point it out because it was too stiff.
 
 - IC
 -- TD62783APG @210 x2: ¥420 Source Driver
 -- TD62083APG @84 Sink driver
 -- TC74HC595AP @94 x3: $282
 - Other
 -- 100pf, set of 10, 100 yen
 -- 10Ω 100 pcs. set, 190 yen
 --- I don't need 100 bottles, but it's cheap so I thought it's okay.
 -- 220microF @20 x2
 -- Other resistance @5 x21
 --- 82Ω 10 pcs (for white LED)
 --- 150Ω 16 pcs (for LED matrix)
 --- 8.2Ω 1 pce (for connecting 10 white LEDs in parallel)
 --- I don't think it adds up to 21 bottles, but the receipt says 21 bottles, mystery.
 In the meantime, I've decided to plug the PDF of the datasheet into Evernote.

 There were too many cables, so I bought a cable with 4 cables attached and made a mess trying to make a breadboard by myself.
 
 Buy single-core wire
