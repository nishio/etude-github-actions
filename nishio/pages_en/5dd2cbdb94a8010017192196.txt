Methodologies that are difficult to observe are only effective for those who use them.

	Even if you give them [the methodology] from the beginning, they don't use it because they don't feel [appreciated]."
	"Don't you appreciate C if you don't do assembly language first?"
	'Don't you appreciate a tractor if you don't plant your seedlings by hand before you use it?'
	I think, "Why should we need to be thankful for tools that we can use without being thankful for them?"

In the case of tractors, even those who plant seedlings by hand can understand that "that one is more productive" when they see someone planting seedlings with a tractor. The productivity-enhancing effects of tools can be understood through observation.

Some methodologies, however, are difficult to observe others using. As a result, only those who have actually used the methodology are acutely aware of its effectiveness.

I had originally written that "only those who [first struggle] and then actually use the methodology can feel the effects acutely," but I separated the two stories because they are mixed up.
