A major turning point seven years ago 7

2011-04 to 2014-09
As a working graduate student
Entered Professional Degree Program in Technology Management, Graduate School of Innovation Management, Tokyo Institute of Technology → Completed

There was a big change in the way I think and see things.

[https://gyazo.com/5982be3383c811dabef0b1b7d560acda]
Want to know what I learned?  8

What did you learn in the Technology Management major?
There was a request for more information, but I didn't know how to tell them.

It is difficult to convey what I myself have learned over the past three and a half years in the limited time of about one hour.
→This time, the explanation focuses on the "first step.

[https://gyazo.com/6b7c62d425a3769a95a09363469e257b]
今回の目的  9 

-We will make your future life better.
Fruit after 510 years, not today and tomorrow.

-Sow the seeds for it now. Focus on the first step of action and explain it.

-Follow-up for those who want to learn more.

[https://gyazo.com/41b09535dac1c59303225b1f38450bf3]
Follow-up Mechanism 10

I have a group on Facebook called "Self-Management Strategies for 180324 Engineers".

I will post the lecture slides to this group later.
Answer questions and post additional information.

Learn something new 11

What is often said in front of a new subject of study
I feel like I should learn, but I just don't have the time."

[Parable of the Lumberjacks] 12

The woodcutter said, "Cutting wood is hard work. It's very time consuming, I'm exhausted."
Traveler: "You'll get more done if you rest a bit and sharpen your saw blade."
Woodcutter: "I'm so busy cutting I don't have time to sharpen my blade."

[The 7 Habits of Stephen Covey

[https://gyazo.com/f85991e5e7bf4c3214c6d1324b143f2d]
Anxiety about new things 13

  I'm [anxious] to do [something new].
  Anxious because it is unclear "what will be gained by doing it.
  Unclear how long it takes to do something new, so there's a lot of mental strain.

[https://gyazo.com/23628b4160ce06691e4cbca1d69c4e2f]
基本戦略:[損失額の限定]　14 
  Limit losses to small amounts when making investments with uncertain outcomes
  Bad example: let's understand this whole book.
　　Good example: let's look at this book for 15 minutes first
  Good example: listen to a one-hour lecture first.
　　→If it's a failure, you only lose an hour.
You all made the decision to listen to the lecture in order to learn about business strategy.

What is [management strategy] 15

Decisions on what to allocate limited resources to #Resource Allocation #Resource Allocation

There are many different definitions, but this time I'm going to delve into one rather than give a broad, shallow explanation.
 	[Strategy Safari]

[https://gyazo.com/478294263ebdfffb0f8ab21abccf2591]
Same for both corporations and individuals 16

limited resources, whether corporate or individual.
The same decisions need to be made about what to allocate to what.

[https://gyazo.com/39fce0247f68707caa9a9fccd889fdcc]

Focus on my personal management 17

 Focus on personal management this time, not corporate.
 It's hard to move big things. Try something small and simple to gain knowledge.
 Learn by experimenting with small code, even in learning programming. [Start small].

[https://gyazo.com/a6e6ab83c7077d72597367950f1c4979]
Self-Management Strategies for Engineers 18

- "Individual Resource Allocation."
-What do you mean by "resources"?
-In the context of corporate management, it is sometimes called "people, goods, money, and information...

[https://gyazo.com/2ee8d9117611ab19c54bc0cde3822acf]
[Doubt the Enumeration] 19

 When you see the enumeration, ask, "Is this all of it?" I will ask you.
 When we assume something is not all of it, we unconsciously overlook our options.
 You are all here this time "allocating your time to gain knowledge". In other words, "time" is a resource.

[https://gyazo.com/49179a40386b1d5ec0f0a58475af4fa2]
What do you hope to gain from the allocation 20

 Management decides "what they want to get out of it."
 Profitability, competitiveness, employee satisfaction, ...
 You decide what you want to get out of it.

[https://gyazo.com/485017e6e154b428fe01d2a6598c393f]
You feel knowledge is valuable 21

-in the time it takes to listen to a one-hour lecture,
I could work part-time at a convenience store and get about $1,000.

-you have your own limited "time".
We are here with the decision to allocate to the acquisition of "knowledge."

-In other words, you value knowledge. Be aware of your values and business decisions.

[https://gyazo.com/98da1e75f30b6b84c76fa0e467beb41a]
The difference between knowledge and money 22

 Your "invest in knowledge acquisition" is a sound business decision.

 [Money disappears when you spend it, but knowledge does not disappear when you spend it.

 Time is the "minimum money needed to live."
 Strategy to invest the remaining "spare time" used to acquire knowledge in the acquisition of

ref. Drucker, "[Postcapitalist Society]."

[https://gyazo.com/fdf6b3291a12619de50d989ad4bc9a4d]
[知識獲得戦略]　23

Let's verbalize and dig into this.

[https://gyazo.com/6b13ad386fb436d972f9f3367b947264]
Three types of knowledge acquisition 24

	1: Teaching
 2: Act on your own
 3: Create a network for knowledge exchange

Related: Dependence, Independence, Interdependence (7 Habits)

[https://gyazo.com/37079bdafdda06f4915365cbc64396b1]
Learning to be taught 25

知識
先生→生徒

-There is a concentrated burden on the teacher.
-Knowledge flows one way.

Reading a book alone is equivalent to this.

[https://gyazo.com/29973a683d7cf586e08ef81538d9c308]
Learning by Doing It Yourself 26

 [行動]→[環境]→[結果]

 Learn by acting, [experimenting] and seeing the results.
 Concentrate the burden on yourself

[https://gyazo.com/b1facccf1ae92f5597555c3c2a488f64]
Learning from the Consequences of Actions 27

	[PDCA Cycle]:.
Do and learn by checking the results.

 [Lean Startup]
Make minimal product quickly and learn from customer response

 How Programmers Learn:.
Write a program, run/compile it, and learn from the results.

[https://gyazo.com/d677d2db4f095246399bb5cbb5c16724]
[Learning through the exchange of knowledge] 28

  [Knowledge flows both ways].
  The burden is distributed

[https://gyazo.com/b59abada9e53f66a301393cc252ef3a5]
[Learn from someone with little knowledge].

[https://gyazo.com/25fb56047185e7d31b1fda4ce9697c06]
[Knowledge Exchange Requirement] = Knowing differently than the other party 30

Learning the same things as those around you does not allow you to exchange knowledge.
[Learning the same things as everyone else around you does not exchange knowledge].

#競争優位
 Seller's advantage Your advantage
------------------------------------------------------------
 Buyer advantage You disadvantage

ref. [Michael Porter]'s [Five Forces Analysis].

[https://gyazo.com/54b0efe45948890311b6ec769f9d9802]
Enter through the [narrow gate] 32
  Many people try to learn what most people around them say is important when they ask, "What should I learn?" and many people try to learn what many people say is important...
  Enter through the narrow gate. For great is the gate that leads to destruction, and many enter through it." *
  Investing limited time in "what many are learning" is unlikely to lead to [competitive advantage].
  ([Market development costs] have the advantage of being low.)
*Matthew 7:13

[https://gyazo.com/51184bb839b132ac631cb3dccd7ed68f]
Create an exchange partner outside the company 33

-Requisite for exchange of knowledge: "I know differently than the other person."
-Tend to share knowledge with others in the company
-It is easy to have a "knowledge exchange relationship" with people from different companies, different industries, etc., who are in different positions.

[https://gyazo.com/c84e53b6dab22c234c93281b2adfcd7f]
Participation in outside study groups 34

It's halfway realized in the form of a study group.

-Exchange of knowledge with people in different positions ◎
-Temporary groups only during study sessions x
-Presenters are doing most of the information dissemination and not knowledge exchange. x

→We want to make it more sustainable and interactive.

[https://gyazo.com/52650b9edd0174a80b6037cb319281e3]
Networking for knowledge exchange 35

-A place for interactive and sustained communication for efficient knowledge acquisition
-Want a companion in the relationship to understand each other's situation and give each other knowledge.
-The first step to that:.
Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

Here's an explanation of why this is a good idea

[https://gyazo.com/a2020042befe92b2d7733e43554b1c45]
I'll explain this first. 36

Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

[https://gyazo.com/b7e004d1e2d06e1dec78bd3438609eec]
Why a small group?　 37

-The word "group" or "community" tends to conjure up images of something big with lots of people.
-this is because the larger ones are easier to observe*.
-Being big has its disadvantages.

*There are a lot of smaller ones, but most of them are not in your field of vision.

[https://gyazo.com/33b0f7d38429a8eb12cde5fc2c2ba944]
Example of answering a question 38

 The larger the group, the more disconnected the words are from the [situation].
 If there were a myriad of questioners, I wouldn't be able to spend time understanding the questioner's situation.
 Responding to the questioner's words without understanding the questioner's situation
ref. [Learning embedded in a situation].

[https://gyazo.com/0a7455fa04e550abfb63f743caff23d8]
Benefits of Situational Understanding1 39

  Compare when respondents understand (do/do not) what and how much the questioner knows
  The cost of answering the question will be reduced, and the probability that the respondent will be able to provide what the questioner was truly seeking will be increased.
  Efficient knowledge exchange

[https://gyazo.com/c8a5b66df2b7c90064f8554b96cb41a8]
Benefits of Situational Understanding 2 40

 When Mr. A consulted me about X.
Connecting Mr. A and Mr. B, remembering that "Mr. B looked up X before."
 This requires an understanding of "Mr. B"
 This "mediation" facilitates two-way knowledge exchange.

[https://gyazo.com/60a43f3869ff7a2d1337a3784719a0f0]
Place gate 41

 One useful means of creating a small group: put up gates (limit who can join).
 What is the difference between not gated (anyone can join) and gated?
#Gated Communities

[https://gyazo.com/989bc51918c25e7535f6a2b1cec8b874]
Generation of free riders 42

 Suppose there was a beneficial group without gates.
 People are attracted by the usefulness of the product.
 Most people come to "take" and not act to "give" to the group.
 Most "takers" eat up limited resources.

Information sharing is exceptional, whether the number of people taking it is 10 or 100.
Since the cost of the informant does not increase, it can still be done in such a situation.
ref.[共有地の悲劇]

[https://gyazo.com/688afeaf9f873016eedd8022bebad377]
Duality of the OSS community 43

  [dual community] to solve this problem.
  Free to enter user community but not free to become a committer
  Only those who have engaged in "giving" activities to enrich the place within that community will be selected to enter the gate.

Let's take a look at this.

[https://gyazo.com/af0e5eeaf287508649791604faf49b89]
Description so far 44
Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

[https://gyazo.com/d9c5e840a5879a4efd52b6a33578c68d]
Description from here 45
Create a small informal group and you become the originator.

[https://gyazo.com/27b18b969c99d9b5570847ccabeb87e2]
Why create your own group 46

-a group created by someone else.
The chances of it being a "you can get in, and it's not a big group" situation are very small.
-If it takes the form of a private group, you will not even be aware of its existence.
-so you have to make it yourself.

[https://gyazo.com/b26820de5eee311eabbe6a7d52143e56]
It is better to start out quietly and informally 47

-There are many hurdles to overcome when trying to build a solid organization from the start.
-Start Small!
-If you start quietly, it acts as a gate in and of itself.

[https://gyazo.com/53fbe93a5c9cd5833c6fd9f4ac28e54f]
To make it a mutually beneficial community 48

-First, you do the "giving" side.
•Give & TakeはGiveから始まる
-First, tell other members what you saw and heard at this event, etc.
Start by "providing information that other members don't have."
-If the other members give, it's a great success!

[https://gyazo.com/f90785d6b5e8723cce2a0237dd5776ab]
The Next Step 49

-Create a small informal group and you will be the originator.
-Multiple group affiliations
-Set the recall trigger

[https://gyazo.com/ba8274cf78ad8a994be1016b060612d4]
Why multiple groups? 　50

-Belonging to several groups with different members makes you a flowing pipeline of knowledge.
-Knowledge, unlike water, accumulates in intermediaries.

[https://gyazo.com/c09ee91935040d33f2d5de8ef88407ae]
Creating Value through Intermediation 51

-Transmitting the knowledge you've gained in Group A to Group B, which is hungry for that knowledge.
Group B people are happy = customer value creation
-Practical experience in brokerage will develop your ability to judge what is worth brokering.
-Mediating information that can be googled and obtained does not lead to value.

Supplemented from the question [copying the answer is futile].

[https://gyazo.com/47ec3df31da51f32f316a83de24f7979]
Benefits of belonging to a number of organizations 52

Knowledge exchange requires you to have knowledge that those around you do not have
That there is more than one "perimeter"?

[https://gyazo.com/a915a6869326ff5adb2609b12d85577f]
Knowledge exchange is possible in each organization 53

Give me this and take this.
Repeat this...

[https://gyazo.com/d62fa810ec8f4f0cc63cfb66d4de6b50]
Human resources with knowledge of multiple fields 54
Also known as "[continuum specialists]" or "[pi-type human resources]."

[https://gyazo.com/f759dba82565e9da6daed47e46653f99]
55 
Q: But I often hear that "developing expertise is important"?

[https://gyazo.com/6af9c5d47f1e3628a07862e3637f9cb8]

[Sea level rise due to technological progress] 56

The level of "readily available knowledge" (at sea level) has increased a lot over the past 10 years due to technological advances.

We need to get above this sea level to participate in the knowledge exchange.
That's why they say it's important to develop expertise.

[https://gyazo.com/6a441f7bbbd66a9f5016b94050033610]
Level of expertise 57

But this term "expertise" is vague and it is not clear to what extent it should be done.
Need to have knowledge that is not available by Googling in order to face out of the sea surface.

 It's a much lower hurdle than the word "expertise" might suggest.

[https://gyazo.com/20870e9d64d84b13eeafa9db59b64e3f]
Like two wheels on a car 58

Act and gain knowledge
 Obtain non-Googleable knowledge through action and experimentation.

他人と知識交換
 Give them knowledge they can't Google, and they'll get different knowledge.

[https://gyazo.com/0c73c40dd3353805c448d1114ccf5f71]
The Next Step 59

  Create a small informal group and you become the originator.
  Belong to multiple groups
  Set the recall trigger

[https://gyazo.com/66919949d05a00ebdb3f709745e48ae0]
Why trigger? 　60

 Sometimes the value is known after time has passed*.
 Long-term memory is more likely to stick if you touch it again after you've forgotten it for about six months or a year.
 The group is high-spirited and active right after it is formed, but it usually becomes a three-day group.

So I'll remind you when time goes by and you've forgotten.

*I was asked immediately after I completed my MOT, "How did your studies help you?" I was asked, "How did it help you?" I answered, "It broadened my perspective," "The book I was writing helped me make different decisions than I had made before," etc. The response was something like, "Hmm.
Supplement: [word is ripe] [rushing to output results in a degraded copy].

[https://gyazo.com/7b7fbc556a9dac6f9a32f1347018c545]
Trigger after 1 year 61

 No postings, no postings, no notifications,
No one reminds me of that group, so I don't post, and so the cycle goes
 Submissions may bring it back to life again.
 Use "it's been a year" as an excuse to post

[https://gyazo.com/33d1835c3efa1c8ade8eabfccc79d539]
Filtering after 1 year 62

 When there are more free riders
 Gather [Giver] to create a new "enrichment group" after a year of activity.
 If more people think the enriched group is better, activities will take place there and the old group will disappear naturally.

Informal groups are not only cheaper to create, but also cheaper to terminate because they can die out naturally.

[https://gyazo.com/dca755d4dd307a0c16d80563492b3b89]
Opportunities for review 63

	Many things can go wrong.
 Not just forgetting about it when what we set out to do does not work,
Looking back a year later, we can learn a great deal.
 However, people forget easily, so set a trigger to remind them when you start the project.

[https://gyazo.com/c3946713f10b9e25e32802e45fe86ec7]
Summary 64

[https://gyazo.com/5c53f2ce86ca1321d3eeb6b47829dbc0]
Your own management 65

 You made a business decision to "invest time in gaining knowledge".
 You make these kinds of resource allocation decisions day after day, and this is management.
 There is also an emphasis on knowledge acquisition in business administration, and there are many discussions and findings.

[https://gyazo.com/07197986edeeb79970a8d07a14547025]
Your own knowledge acquisition strategy 66

 There are three types of learning: "taught" and "learning by doing," which many of us have probably already experienced.
 Often overlooked is "knowledge exchange.
 In order to do this, we need associates in a relationship where we understand each other's situation and give each other knowledge. How do we create this?

[https://gyazo.com/5bfd2f529bd7c538e99656ef034b4590]
First Steps 67

 First, create a small informal group and you become the originator.
 Belong to multiple groups and become a conduit through which knowledge flows
 Set a recall trigger and look back a year later
