　Some people try to judge future price movements based on whether or not the [resistance line] has been broken through.
　　Mr. A argues that "the resistance has been broken through the resistance line, so the resistance is gone and it will go up in the future.
　　Mr. B argues, "We have touched a long-term maintained resistance line, this is the peak and we will go down in the future.
　Resistance lines are often mistaken for objective entities, but they are subjective entities that vary in location from person to person
　　The "resistance line has been broken through" is also a subjective interpretation.
　　Whether you think you've gone through with it or not depends on who you are.
　　　[false dichotomy] "has it broken through the resistance line or not?"
