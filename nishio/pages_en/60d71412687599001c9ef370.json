	>According to the "Introduction" written by d'Alembert, this was an encyclopedia "that could be consulted across all areas of technology and learning, and that would serve to enlighten those who studied only for themselves and at the same time guide those who felt brave enough to work for the education of others. This book, a collection of the cutting edge of technical and scientific knowledge of the time, contributed greatly to breaking the old worldview and bringing rational and free thinking to the people. However, the Encyclopédie, which was published in the midst of tension with the regime from the planning stage, was not only meaningful for the ideas it contained, but its publication itself had a political meaning, and can be considered an achievement of 18th century France [Enlightenment thought].
