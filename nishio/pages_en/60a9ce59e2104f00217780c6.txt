Change is unequal
>When people switch from measure A to measure B, they do so because measure B is more beneficial, so saying "make A and B equal" is tantamount to saying "don't change, be stagnant.
> If this "everyone is equally inefficient" and "let's avoid change and stagnate together! will continue, I think resentment will build up, especially among the younger generation, and eventually explode. People who are now 80 years old may be able to escape from the wave of a major change in values, but I don't think people who are now 20 years old will be able to escape from it.
