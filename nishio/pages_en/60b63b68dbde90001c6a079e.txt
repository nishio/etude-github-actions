Ideas are worthless.
The phrase "[the idea] has no value" has lost much of its context and is ambiguous.

Examples of context-supplemented

　An idea that the person thinks is a good idea, but in reality has not developed at all, has little chance of developing even if it is kept in the chest and believed to be a good idea, so it is better to talk about it with others and use it as material for generating new ideas.
　　This isn't "worthless", it's "low value".
　　The [false dichotomy] of "is an idea worthwhile or not?" is a futile argument.
