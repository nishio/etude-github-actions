weak genius

Some argue that "labeling young people as '[geniuses]' is harmful."

I have certainly seen a number of cases where the label is part of the cause of the mental problems. But on the other hand, it is also an observed fact that it is a minority that does so.

If so, instead of lumping them all together as "harmful," we should consider when they become harmful and what we can do to reduce the probability of them becoming harmful.

When a person is labeled a genius, the media treats him or her as if he or she is "[a] strong person. They create a false image of the person as if he or she were a [superhuman] who is disconnected from reality and happily consumed.

However, flesh and blood people have "[weakness]". The person with the weakness is the real one, but if you think you are the false image of a "strong person" while being played by the media and the adults around you, you will be torn apart by the gap between reality and false image.

Added 2022-09-08: Media that consume young geniuses as content don't care if their target audience is torn apart and heartbroken. Because by then the new "young geniuses" will have arrived and they don't see the value in keeping the old product healthy.

Some people say that it is necessary to "beat them up so they don't grow up" in order to prevent such misunderstandings, but I think it's a little different. I don't think it should be done by an adult, an older person, or a senior person, taking advantage of the [authority gradient based on age].

I think it would be good to have "[a] push from below" where the peers, the younger ones, the juniors, are amazing.

It would be better to form a group of people who are good at what they do and are not good at what they do, and who think "who is stronger than me" with each other.
"[A] group of weak geniuses."
