Managing Ourselves
A concept equivalent to what I called "self-management" in [(7.2) Self-Management Strategies] and [Self-Management Strategies for Engineers].

>The assumption that management is for companies has already broken down. It is for organizations of all kinds. Moreover, it is for each and every human being. How we manage ourselves is now of critical importance. The paradigm shift that Drucker developed in "What Will Rule Tomorrow" (1999) confirmed the nature of management as a system and its current status. Moreover, the question of how to work and how to contribute is directly related to the question of how to live.
> According to Drucker, the content and methods of education will be quite different from those of the past. Education in a knowledge-centered society means having knowledge of computers, foreign languages, and management in addition to reading and writing, advanced knowledge of one's own area of expertise, knowledge of the semantics of other areas of expertise, and knowledge of how to manage one's own life.
