ã€€I tried to install it, but it doesn't seem to be working properly. I downloaded all the data, but only got an empty JSON.

The chain of servants hoard friendships and carry over excess money and actions at the anchorage. If you put in more money, you can use the excess over 8 money in the next turn.

It's funny how you buy a tailgater and immediately use it in a city-state.
Four tailing out and lots of draws, very stable.
I was going to acquire a town in the import trade and make it a city-state, but the other guy bought it and it withered away.
One line summary: town 4 tailing 5 pulling off deck

Plus action in town, + purchase
Import merchant to obtain imperial envoy, draw in imperial envoy.
No compression? Oh, the restoration?
One line summary: town 6 imperial 5 draw-off deck, too slow to catch up.

I was a little slow on the combo.
I wonder if the compression is too slow in the restoration.

So the draw is the hunter.
Architects get cheaper cards than those earned in 2-friendship
You can buy a 5 gold action card and a silver coin, or a gold coin and a 5 gold action card.
One-line summary: Hunter Stero

Barbarian!
I put in a herb picker to draw gold for the deck, expecting the deck to be terrible, but the barbarians killed me.
The mountain people are 5 friendlies and 3 draws, isn't that high? But because of the barbarians, I acquired and discarded a sesame that I didn't want and saved up on my own, so I changed 2 last turn genus states with a play that hit the marquis after the draw. I also had to discard 4 curses.
One line summary: barbarian shootout development in the beginning, buy gold with 6 gold while buying a capital with 5 gold you can't buy, buy a town with 4 gold, rotate the deck, put in a marquis and draw.
