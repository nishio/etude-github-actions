Classes are physical education
[********** The class is]
[********** 体育]

	This meeting is not a "lecture" but a class
 Intellectual production cannot be done by slides and other explanations of how to act and behave.
 It is the same as physical education. If you don't actually move your body yourself, you won't learn it.
 How do you learn how to shoot a basketball in physical education class?
 	It's not right that the teacher ends up just explaining things with a PowerPoint presentation at the podium.
		I'll show you how to do it, and each of us will try it ourselves.
		There is no way to learn without it.
