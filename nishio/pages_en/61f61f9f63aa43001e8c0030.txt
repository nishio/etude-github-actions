Do not lose self-esteem.
Judge yourself strictly according to your own self-esteem, not "because others will sanction it."

from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Do not lose self-respect.
l 

Do not lose [self-respect] and do not become too comfortable with yourself. Let your sense of righteousness be your true standard, and owe more to the rigor of your own self-judgment than to any external sanction. Rather than fear external authority, be mindful of your own self-esteem and avoid all unseemly behavior. Pay attention to this and you will not need Seneca's imaginary tutor.
