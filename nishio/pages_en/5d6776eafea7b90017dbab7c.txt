The Art of Communication
As a result of compiling several sticky notes in the process of [the KJ method of "interesting"], a group similar to "[scientific art]" and "[mathematical art]" was created, which included [letters], [family crest], [prefecture marks], [tattoos], [illustrations], [patterns], [designs], and so on. The term "information transmission art" was born as a result of thinking about what kind of nameplate to put on this group.
