 *1315358107*Try the 5-day photo reading test
 For those who are not sure if photoreading is effective or not, the plan "Let's try this process for 5 days" was written, so I decided to try it. ref: "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/ product/4894513692/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4894513692">You can You can read books 10 times faster than before</a>".
 
 A brief description of the 5-day plan
 - Day 1: Preparation → Photos
 - Day 2: Preparation→search for keywords→photo→write out keywords (X)
 - Day 3: Preparation → Photo → Vertical reading → X reading
 - Day 4: Preparation→Photo→Vertical reading→X reading→Consider questions
 - Day 5: Preparation → Photos → Table of Contents reading → Vertical reading → Find answers to questions
 It's a bit like that. Here, "photo" stands for photo-reading, "keyword search" is previewing, and "vertical reading" corresponds to super-reading, dipping, and skittering. The "vertical reading" corresponds to super-reading, dipping, and skittering, while the "naname-yomi" in Japanese is closest to "naname-yomi. Well, this list does not exactly match the procedures described in the book. If I were to write it in a way that it corresponds exactly, I would have to explain what super-reading is, which would be a lot of work, and it would be difficult to grasp the whole picture.
 
 And do each of them in less than 30 minutes. 2.5 hours in 5 days. The "less than 30 minutes" seems like 25 minutes (1 pomodoro), so that's what I'll do. ref. <a href="http://www. amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4048689525/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN= 4048689525">Agile Time Management: Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique</a>.
 
 Now, I am searching the bookshelf for a good book to experiment with. It's hard to choose one, because if it's something I plan to use in the near future, I might not be able to wait five days to read it, and if it's something I have no interest in at all, it would be "the right choice not to read it. Oh, I'll take this one. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4314003049/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative= 7399&creativeASIN=4314003049">Beyond Freud</a>. It's a book I bought out of interest but never read, so it's not urgent, and it seems like a good target because I'm finding it a bit interesting right now. By the way, my understanding of Freud is only "some kind of erotic old man" lol.
 
 By the way, I usually don't measure how many pages I read in a minute when I read a book, so I can't estimate how long it would take me to read a book normally. This is not good. But if I measure it with the same book, it won't be helpful. I wonder if I can at least manage to guess the rough order of the book. If the Keihan Limited Express train from Yodoyabashi to Demachiyanagi takes 55 minutes, and if one new book can be read on the return trip, a new book is said to contain 120,000 to 150,000 characters, so I would say 60,000 characters in about one hour. This book is 50 characters x 18 lines x 190 pages, so 170,000 characters. That's about 170,000 words, so if I spend 2.5 hours, I can read one book. So, I guess I can consider it as a comparison between normal reading and photo-reading.
 
 Okay, so day 1, preparation and photo reading. Particularly important in the preparation is to verbalize the purpose of reading the book. I don't know much about Freud, so I need to get a rough understanding of Freud's theories by reading something written from a critical standpoint, not from a believer's standpoint, to determine if the book contains anything useful for my life, and to make a leverage memo to post on my blog after 5 days, I guess that's it. Verbalizedone. do photo reading. I look at my watch. It's only been a few minutes.
 
 I felt that it would be a shame to finish in a few minutes, so I went ahead to the second day and did the keyword extraction, another photo reading, and even wrote out the keywords. Hehe. But still, only 20 minutes passed. By the way, the list of keywords I wrote down was "What is the death instinct? Why do we have defects? Instinct"...isn't this not a list of keywords, but a list of questions to be made on the fourth day? Hmmm, without looking at the book, I'm trying to remember another keyword now... "narcissism", "attachment to mother", "patriarchy"... I wonder. I'm not sure how much of the task of "making a list of keywords" is complete...when I wrote that, I suddenly remembered that somewhere in the photo-reading book there was a description of "20-25 keywords". I don't have it with me right now, so I can't check. I need to measure how much I can do in 25 minutes.
 
 Death Instinct, Scientific Psychology, Unconscious, Libido, Transference, Dreams, Symbolic Language, Bourgeois Materialism, Personality Structure, Eros...10 keywords in 5 minutes...it would take a little over 10 minutes to list 20 keywords. It also takes time to write. Well, I've spent 25 minutes in all, so I'll leave it at that for today.
 
 Summary: I did the day 1 and day 2 schedule in 25 minutes, which works out to about 3 minutes for a 190 page photo reading and a little over 10 minutes for a list of 20 keywords.
