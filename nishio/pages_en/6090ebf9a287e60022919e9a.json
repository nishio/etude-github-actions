 *1219478567* Fatigue conversion
 Life hacks that attempt to eliminate mental fatigue by converting it into physical fatigue and then sleeping.
 
 But lately when I get tired, I have to sleep for a long time to recover. I wonder if it is due to aging...
 
 *1219514856*I met with Mr. Kajuntk.
 I took a paid vacation to Hayama to meet id:kajuntk, whose <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kajuntk/20080819/1219103114#c'>funny entry</a> praising me recently made the hot entry list. I went to Hayama to meet him.
 
 At the very least, he has a better understanding of the workings of human society than I do. I am not very good at understanding the emotional and cognitive states of others, so his point of view is very helpful to me.
 
 First, a point about the commoditization of conferences. I thought it was "becoming available to anyone, anywhere, at any time (like commodities)," which I thought was what 1000speakers was trying to achieve. However, what he means by commoditization seems to be "the lowering of the barriers to entry (where previously only those with a certain level of enthusiasm would participate), which in turn lowers the overall level of participation by the general public.
 
 And as the level of presentation level declines, the benefit to those who give high level presentations diminishes, and the room is filled with more and more low level presentations. Even I can see that this is a phenomenon that has been repeated not only at conferences but also in many other situations.

 The GNU model that Senspy is modeling was successful because it implemented a high-pass filter in the first place: availability of resources.
 
 So, implementing this model in a conference without considering the high-pass filter would be an absolute failure.

 I've been trying to "how to lower the threshold," but that alone will eventually lead to a "conference where people talk nonsense. Well, that makes sense. However, as a policy of 1000speakers, we don't want to "filter by previous presentation experience," so we need to think of a better way.
 
 I thought it was enough to filter out the "I'm not sure what will be useful for my work at a conference of an unspecified genre, so those who still come are probably people who are willing to listen to interesting talks in different fields. However, I was surprised to see entries like "I got to see Matz live, I'm so excited! as an example, he explained that there are people who attend conferences simply out of a sense of meekness, so simply asking whether or not they would attend is not a sufficient filter. I see.
 
 But on the other hand, id:ripjyr said before, "It's easy to give a reason and cancel right before the conference. I also remember that he said, "We can't forget that they have been brave enough to attend the conference. It is not a matter of simply strengthening the filter.
 
 After all, my and id:amachang's thinking is biased toward "how to give confidence to false negatives (people who think they are not interesting when they really are)," while kajuntk points out that "simply lowering the threshold will increase false positives. kajuntk points out that "simply lowering the threshold will increase false positives". I agree.
 
 I think I understand what you pointed out. I will think about how to design to solve the problem in the future.
 
 For example:
 - Reduce the number of presenters and increase the time per presenter
 -- More time for discussion after reviewing the content of the presentation = negative incentives for content that does not stand up to discussion
 - Establish an "Ex-Participant Quota." Up to 50%.
 -- Currently, people who have attended 2 or 3 times refrain from participating, but this causes almost all the rooms to be filled with "people who are not used to study groups," which raises operating costs. It is necessary to ensure that 50% of the participants are first-time attendees, while at the same time allowing those who have attended before to participate without hesitation.
 - Establish a "phone shocking slot (introduction slot)
 -- A person who is qualified under some condition can bring another presenter. The current "keynote speaker slots" are almost equivalent to this. The current "Keynote Speaker Slot" is almost equivalent to this.
 -- This has been suggested several times, and I think it is not a bad option to improve the quality of the presentations. I think it would be in keeping with the purpose of the meeting if we set a limit to the number of slots and keep a certain number of participants without introductions.

 <body>"I got to see Matz live, I'm thrilled!" I don't think you should take this as a negative thing. People don't always express everything they feel, and I think the appeal of conferences lies not only in the exchange of discussion itself, but also in the encounter with real people and real places. I think it is also possible to consider the possibility that the excitement of the meeting will further deepen the person's activities. <br>When the late Professor Emeritus Jiro Watanabe of the University of Tokyo gave a speech at a conference held at Kyoto University, he went on and on about how thrilled he was to "come to the Kyoto University campus for the first time, where Professor Nishida (Kitaro) was. Even though he is over seventy years old, it is possible for any great scholar to be moved by the feeling of "I saw a live XXX in person. </body

 <body>Adding a misleading expression, I wrote: "I was thrilled to see Matz in person! <body>"There are people who attend conferences simply because they are meek, so simply attending is not enough as a filter.
