What I learned only after 12 hours of drawing cylinders
[I only realized this after 12 hours of drawing cylinders. It takes a lot of time to "realize" it, but everyone is taught first, right? | ■ Living Journey ■ http://izoomi-momo.jugem.jp/?eid=1243701] [archive https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/http://izoomi-momo.jugem. jp/?eid=1243701]

>Don't think about completing [the drawing]. The moment you think it, it becomes a chore.

>It's easy to teach how to draw. But the important thing is to realize it by yourself. People who are accustomed to being taught become incapable of doing the same thing on their own. To have an eye for [noticing], you need time to thoroughly confront the object.
	[with eyes to notice].

> "It doesn't make sense to fix just one part of the shape. When you think something is wrong, the whole thing is usually different somewhere. You have to correct all the different places a little bit at a time. That is the basic principle.
	> [If you think something is wrong, fixing just that part won't fix it].
	> Even the places that you think are not strange are distorted a little bit, so you have to work on the whole thing.


 I didn't think I needed to make any more changes anywhere, but when I went away and looked closely for 10 minutes, it wasn't done at all.
  [I think I've got it.]
