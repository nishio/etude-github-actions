	The canned phrase used in marriage activity, "I want to get married one of these days if I find the right person."
	This is a story about how "good people," "eventually," and "I want to get married" are all [iffy].
	In Nishio's common phrase, they are "[abstract concepts]" and lack [concreteness].
		Related: "[(6.2.3) Sense of body]" on p.192 of "[Engineers' intellectual production techniques]".
			This is a story about bringing [abstract concepts] closer to [physical sensation].
		Let's be more specific about this story itself.

What I think about when someone says, "I want to get married one of these days if I find the right person."
	The words "nice guy," "one of these days," and "I want to get married" are abstract concepts.
	We need to ask questions to flesh these out.
	Of the three, "I want to get married" is the closest to [physical sensation] in action, so focus on this.
		Related: [sensory, conceptual, symbolic].
	Also, "I want to get married" is a [remedy] in the [PRO model
	So the next question is, "If I get married, what happens [next]?" Right.
