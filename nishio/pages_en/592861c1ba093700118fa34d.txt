dialectics
[https://gyazo.com/bc0921e3e5bc20eee701f2c9b3973880]
The idea that a proposition (thesis) and a proposition that denies it (antithesis) are considered, and a new proposition (synthesis) is obtained by abandoning them and rising to a higher level (cessation: Aufheben). #comprehension
Hegel's dialectic is famous, but the concept of "conflict and its resolution" is widely used beyond it.

[TRIZ] is an attempt to view patents as "conflicts between physical performances and their resolution," and to extract patterns of what can be used for what conflicts.

The [NM method] is a method of mapping a problem to a space of analogies to come up with a solution, with the goal of resolving conflicts in a real-world problem.
