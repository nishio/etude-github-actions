People who think an unconnected addition is a good idea.

　Some people think that making an addition to A and then B makes it better.
　Some people think it's "[an] unconnected addition."
　　If the link is connected and you get a C, then it's "better than A."
　　At stage B, it feels rather worse.
　　　Because we consider a network of closely linked links to be a good thing.
　　　Strictly speaking, maybe it's not getting worse.
　　　　Because the cost of discarding the additions and returning them to A is cheap.
　　The cost of an additional "A→B" without [context] is much cheaper than "B→C" linking
　　If you're going to add something new, why not at least link to it from an existing one?
　　　So this [0s, 1s, and 100s].
　　　B is added to A, so it has increased or decreased in value.
　　　　Increased from 0 to 1.
　　　But there are "ways to get more."
　　　　There is a way to turn 0 into 100.
　Can we include it in [narrow observation area] or not?
　　You're not seeing the context.
　　What is a "pulse"?
　　　Don't you understand that there is a [network of knowledge]?

 　Simply adding without doing the latter is not very beneficial.
