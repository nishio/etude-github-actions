　Thoughts.
　　[consider in order from the smallest to the largest].
　　When the number is two, subtract the smaller one from the larger one.
　　What about when there are three?
　　　c-(a-b) is in essence c-a+b
　　That is, N/2 units are negative.
　　Then we can sort and set the smaller half to negative.
　公式解説
　　You're missing (a-b)-c when you have three.
