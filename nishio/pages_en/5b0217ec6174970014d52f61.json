Three-dimensional task list
 Lack of motivation when the task list is full is the same as [the jam experiment].
 We tend to represent the task list as a one-dimensional list without any particular rationale, and the experiment of arranging it in two dimensions on the iPad was rather good, but in the end, we cannot escape from the problem of "written but not done" tasks gradually becoming stagnant and demotivating in a system that does not erase them.
 I'm hoping the sensory repetition method will gradually make it disappear.
 I mean three dimensional.
