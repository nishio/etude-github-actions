Creation and Good
The idea that [creation] was done by a God of [good] attributes is simply a major religious view, not a necessity.
	>Plato called the creator [demiurgos] (meaning the craftsman who makes the world) and held that [good and evil] were undifferentiated at this stage. This idea was carried over into Gnosticism.
 >[Gnosticism] held that the [Creator God] [Yahweh] of the Old Testament was the [devil].
