You choose, I buy.
A bookstore and library in Shenzhen are working together to provide an interesting service. Instead of choosing from the library's inventory, readers can choose from the bookstore's inventory or from the online store. Readers have a wider choice, libraries can outsource the burden of selecting books from new publications that readers might want to read (a burden that was particularly heavy for technical books), and bookstores can attract more customers. It is a revolutionary system.

At a huge bookstore called Shenzhen Book City Central City
	[https://gyazo.com/db8a612a95b4f76cd9538241235b71de]
	At first I thought it was a book search terminal, but at the top it says "You choose, I buy (你选书 我买单)".
	There's a place to touch "reader's card."
	There's something about the system that's different from what you might imagine in a "bookstore."

Shenzhen Book City I found a detailed description of "You choose, I buy" that I saw at Central City in Nanshan City.

consideration
	In short, a system in which readers select books for the collection instead of library staff.
	One person may receive one book per month, up to five books per month, no books that are already plentiful in the library, and a maximum book value.
		The risk to the library is not great. If the program is more popular than expected and the budget line is used up, it can remain dormant until the following year.
		A portion of the original book purchase budget is allocated to this system, and the task of selecting books for the collection is transferred to the actual users.
	Limit of 100 yuan
		100 yuan is 1,500 yen, but in Japan the limit would need to be raised even higher.

			This "Chinese Philosophical Common Sense" is a book published by Beijing University of Science and Technology Press, based on a course taught by a professor at that university, 322 pages.
			I think these books would cost over 3,000 yen in Japan, but the actual price was 43 yuan (650 yen).

	Japanese libraries often only have books that are too old or not good enough, especially when it comes to technical books
		I assumed it was inevitable because library staff are not technicians.
		This system would be an improvement.
	Japanese technical books are expensive and difficult for young people to obtain.
		If the library does not have a good selection, you will read online articles that you can read for free instead of reading technical books
		Even if there are good technical books out there, they are not read.
	It would be good to collect information about this system and send it out in Japanese

	Similar initiatives in certain wards of Huizhou
		Readers can not only buy at bookstores, but also have it delivered to their homes as if they were shopping online.
		Authenticate with your library reader card.
		云书馆=雲書館= cloud library, interesting name.
		The event budget is 30,000 yuan and ends immediately when it runs out.
		One person can borrow three books.
		If books purchased online exceed 70 yuan, they will be delivered free of charge for home delivery.
			The purchase limit is 3 books, so if you have already borrowed 1 or 2 books from the library, you can only purchase that number of books online minus 3. Then, there is a high possibility that the price will not exceed RMB 70. Therefore, if you have already borrowed a book from the library, we recommend that you return it first before making an online purchase, according to the article.

	2017 Budget Report of Shenzhen's Futian District Library
	Mentioned under the name of the "Book Choice" project.
 	>(Google Translate) District General Headquarters purchased 171,000 paper books (works) throughout the year and added two new databases: the eBay Digital Cartoon Museum and the Xinhua eShop WeChat eBooks. Updated the CNKI China Knowledge Resource Pool, Knowledge-Based Reading, Longyuan eJournal, new Oriental Multimedia Learning Library, Huike News, VIP Exam Resource System, and other digital resources; 1,500 different 2016 journals, 164 newspaper types, with a total of 860,000 readers using a variety of resources throughout the year and borrowing 410,000 copies of literature (Zhang). At the same time, the district library is constantly optimizing its "library at your fingertips," adding new bookshelves to its book guide service and improving the functionality of its digital reading platform. The "Book Choice" project was initiated to create a reading promotion platform, combined with the library + bookstore model, to engage readers in the construction of their public libraries. This has not only enhanced collection resources and increased access to literature, but also stimulated citizens' enthusiasm for reading. This year, mobile self-service APP downloads increased by 1,926 and the number of articles downloaded by readers through the mobile APP exceeded 23,000. The number of visitors to the Digital Library website reached 1.93 million, the number of electronic digital resources visited reached 2.95 million, and download traffic was 66G. The wireless network "WIFI" was used 243,000 times and usage traffic was 8.5 TB.

	Explanation of the use of "South Tutu E-borrowing" by the library
	What it says.
 	You can participate if you have a "Shenzhen City Library Castle" reader card.
 	Can be used both offline and online.
 		Readers can visit the Nanzan Library and select books on-site or from the comfort of their own home.
 		You pick it out on your phone and it gets delivered to your house.
 		Free online and offline
 	How to go offline
			Readers with a reader's card can choose 5 books on site at Nanzan Book City.
			You can check if the book meets the requirements by using the "Scan Code" tool in the "Bookshelf" of the public number of the South Mountain Library.
				([nishio.icon]I think the public number is the official WeChat account, which means that there is a WeChat app, like the LINE app, that scans the book barcode to determine if it meets the requirements.)
			Lending process can be completed at the front desk of the bookstore
		How to do it online
			Log in with your reader number from the Nan Shan Library web page or WeChat account.
			Select the desired book and add it to the bookshelf, the button is grayed out when it cannot be added
				([nishio.icon]I don't know whether this list of books is maintained by the library or Nanzan Shojo, but I'm sure they use APIs or other means to make their systems work together, and I'd like to actually use them.)
			Submit your order according to the requirements of the online bookstore and enter your level 4 address and phone number
				([nishio.icon]Not sure what level 4 is)
			After your order has been successfully placed, the online bookstore will deliver the merchandise according to the receipt information you have provided.
		2. warehousing
			After ordering, the bookstore will deliver the books to your door immediately, so make sure your phone is unblocked and the courier company is easy to reach. Current express delivery service is limited to Shenzhen city limits.
				([nishio.icon]I took the liberty of imagining mailing it, but maybe it will be delivered the same day via bike delivery.)
		3. Return the book
			Bring your reader's card to the front desk in the main hall of the Shenzhen Nanshan Library to return books on time.
