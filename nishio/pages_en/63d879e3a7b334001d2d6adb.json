　[On the boundary between what already exists and what does not yet exist
　　Already exists]" is [spiked].
　　There are a lot of [gaps] in between, so there are a lot of [things] that haven't been done yet.
　　However, when [resolution] is low, this spike becomes blurry and thick
　　The "gap between" is invisible.
　　This makes the front line more distant.
