Direction of deep understanding
In Japanese, the expression "deep understanding" is used. According to this expression, the "deep understanding" axis is downward, but for the author, upward seems more natural. The higher the level of abstraction, the higher the "why" of why to do something and why it works, and the lower the concrete knowledge and "how-to" (how to do something). I also think that the "wide field of view" extends to the left and right, and the "applied object," which is difficult to see, is in the depth direction (Fig. a). I don't have a firm basis for this, though.
