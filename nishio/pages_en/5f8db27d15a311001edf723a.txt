MemoryError in AtCoder's Python results in RE
code:python
 xs = [0] * (10 ** 9)

In these cases, the Python processor throws a runtime exception before the memory limit is exceeded by actually allocating memory, saying that such an amount of memory cannot be allocated. Therefore, the display on the judge server is not MLE but RE.
