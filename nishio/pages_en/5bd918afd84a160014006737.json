Necessary and sufficient conditions
[https://gyazo.com/418952fa3ac2d2acc9628ec8416db698]

	Necessary or sufficient?" is a false dichotomy.
	If a phenomenon is caused by multiple causes AND[* only], each cause is a necessary condition
 When a phenomenon is caused by multiple causes OR, each condition is a sufficient condition
 But real phenomena do not only occur in either of those patterns.
 If it occurs in `(A and B) or (C and D)`.
 	`(A and B)` is a sufficient condition for the phenomenon
  A is a necessary condition for the satisfaction of `(A and B)`.
		Is A a necessary condition for the phenomenon? Is it a sufficient condition?" is [a false dichotomy].
			Neither.
