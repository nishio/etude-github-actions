Find the conditional maximum in logarithmic order
Given two sequences Ai, Bi, we want to find the largest Ai for which Bi does not exceed x.
If it is a single shot, it can be found in linear order, but since it is repeated with different x, we want to preprocess it to logarithmic order.

Sort (Ai, Bi) in lexicographic order and remove j such that Bj>Bi and Aj<=Ai. Because they will never be a solution.

For the columns removed, find the largest i for which Bi does not exceed x in a binary search.
