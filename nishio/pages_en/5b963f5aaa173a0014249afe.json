Bertrand's Paradox
In the classical interpretation of probability theory, "Consider an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. One string of that circle is chosen at random. What is the probability that that string will be longer than the side of the equilateral triangle?" is a story that shows how different values can be obtained depending on what exactly is meant by randomness and how we take equally certain events.

	Random endpoint" method → 1/3
 Random radius" method → 1/2
 Random midpoint" method → 1/4

In response, Jaynes proposed the [principle of maximum ignorance].
As long as the problem statement does not mention location or size, the value must be independent of location and size. Of the three above, only the "random radius" method satisfies this condition.
