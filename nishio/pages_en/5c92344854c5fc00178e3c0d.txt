Those who don't need it don't need it.
Talking about whether a certain [means] X is necessary.
Some people say "no" as to whether a certain means ([tool], [methodology], etc.) is necessary.
Means are paired with [objectives], and different people have different objectives
Not being necessary for his/her purpose does not mean that he/she does not need it for his/her own.

Means bridge the gap between goals and current conditions ([gap between reality and ideals])
People who don't have a gap don't need that means.
It is unclear from the lack of information whether the lack of gap is due to the person's current high ability or his/her low ideals
It's not useful to know that, so it's better to go through with "you don't need it.
