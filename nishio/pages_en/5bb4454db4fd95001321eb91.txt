Cybozu's Human Resources System
2018-10-03
>Cybozu today" tends to catch people's attention, but I think what is useful as knowledge is "what Cybozu has done in the past 10 years to get to where it is today. There is a book by the president himself that talks about his own naked failures, as well as a variety of information provided by employees, so you should be able to track a lot just from the public information. [Twitter @nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1047324307146207233]
Therefore, I have arranged them in chronological order with the intention of summarizing how they have developed over time.

Summary for busy people
	The system started in 2007 with two options for how to work, was expanded to nine categories in 2013, and in 2018 the options were eliminated so that each individual can set his or her own work style.
 The approach to incorporate market assessments began in 2012; in 2016, the company announced itself as "in passing."

	If you're looking for story-like readability, this is the one for you.
	Below is a summary of the material

-----
	1997-2001: Evaluation System: 1997-2001, when the company was founded, were individual evaluations, decided by the president. ([Nakane https://www.hrpro.co.jp/hrsummit/2016/stage1/sp_rpt02.php])
	2000/8: Listed on Mothers.
 	Head office in Osaka is relocated to Tokyo.
  All Osaka-based employees were also transferred to Tokyo, and the Osaka office was closed.

	2001-2002 Evaluation System: [Goal management] and [performance-based] personnel system were introduced from 2001 to 2002.
 	It didn't work."([Nakane https://www.hrpro.co.jp/hrsummit/2016/stage1/sp_rpt02.php])
  >Based on a goal management sheet, supervisors and subordinates discuss their goals, which are then evaluated once every six months, and wages are determined based on a 100-point scale. ([Yamada https://jinjibu.jp/article/detl/tonari/252/])

 2003-2005: Evaluation System: [360-degree evaluation] was introduced in 2003-2005.
 	>Employees began to worry about their own evaluations and the sense of unity was undermined. ([Nakane https://www.hrpro.co.jp/hrsummit/2016/stage1/sp_rpt02.php])
		>The score was lowered from 100 points to 60 points for goal management, and the evaluation from the general manager of another division was set at 30 points, and the evaluation from five randomly selected employees from the employee's own division was set at 10 points, making a total of 100 points.... ...Regarding the evaluations from fellow employees, which were incorporated for the 360-degree evaluation, the evaluators were randomly chosen after six months, which meant that employees did not know exactly who they were being evaluated by and how they were being evaluated. As a result, it became unclear with whom and what kind of work was being evaluated, and the sense of unity within the company became diluted, with only the scores walking alone ([Yamada http://jibun.atmarkit.co.jp/lcareer01/rensai/cybozu/01/02. html])
		>It is difficult to give a score for a process or challenge. It is not satisfactory for the individual to be told, "How many points did you get because someone else, other than your boss, said this..." A "strain" has been created between the supervisor and the subordinate. Dissatisfaction with evaluations increases, and people who have been hired quit... Anyway, we decided that we needed a personnel system that would prevent people from quitting ([Yamada https://jinjibu.jp/article/detl/tonari/252/]).

 2005-2006: Aggressive M&A activity in 2005-2006
 	9 companies in 18 months
  The company grew, more than doubling its consolidated sales and number of employees.
  >But the number of strangers in the company was growing, the ideals they were striving for were becoming disparate, and turnover was skyrocketing. ([Nakane https://www.hrpro.co.jp/hrsummit/2016/stage1/sp_rpt02.php])
		>Mergers and acquisitions (M&A)... The stock price went up gangbusters, and the market capitalization reached 140 billion yen. That's about 7 times what it is now. Even though the profit at that time was about 500 million yen! The company was sold with a bang due to the Livedoor shock. When I looked at the shareholder list, I was surprised to see that the composition had changed... We were told, "It's no good if we continue with the way we have been thinking... We changed our policy so that only those who agree with our desire to build this kind of company and create this kind of world should buy our shares. ([Yamada https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000323.html])

	2005/4 President: Takasuga→Aono

 2005/8 Cybozu Labs established; President: Hata

	2006: Evaluation system: from results-oriented to ability-oriented, "trust" and "[skill x determination]" concepts introduced.
 	>We do not evaluate results against goals, but rather the ability to do what it takes to achieve those goals....
  >Cybozu positions not only "ability" but also "trust" as an important axis of evaluation, and uses "skill x determination" to evaluate employees with respect to their goals as the key points of evaluation. The key point of evaluation is "skill x determination" toward the target. No matter how high your ability is, if you are not interested in Cybozu, you cannot be evaluated.
  >If the employee does not agree with the evaluation after meeting with the supervisor, the employee can talk to the supervisor above him or her, and even to the Human Resources Department.

			Considering the various life events that employees will experience over the course of their long lives, it is difficult to increase employee satisfaction and motivation to work only by emphasizing performance. It is important to provide both "performance-oriented" and "seniority-oriented" ways of working.
   The "career-track job system" and the "general job system" are often adopted by large companies, but they are often thought of as systems for men and systems for women. These systems should be made parallel so that employees can freely choose between them regardless of gender or type of job. Which one is chosen is solely up to the individual.

If a society does not provide childcare, children will not grow up and the market will shrink. If a society does not take care of its children, it will not nurture them and the market will shrink.
