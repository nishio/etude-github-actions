 However, when I told the receptionist that I had come to get a compress before it became painful because I was feeling some discomfort in the place where I had hurt before, she told me that I had been examined last time and that if I only needed a compress from now on, I could just say so at the receptionist's office. Then I got 10 points for medical management, etc. and 140 points for medication, which is 150 points. I got three bags of seven large compresses for my lower back for 450 yen. That's cheap. They work better than the compresses I bought at the pharmacy. There is no longer any point in buying compresses at the pharmacy.
