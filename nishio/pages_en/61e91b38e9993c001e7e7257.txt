(2.4) Summary
In this chapter, we learned how to solve the situation without motivation. The big reason for losing motivation is not to focus on one task. Also, another big reason after choosing one task is that the task is too big. There are cases in which the task is actually large, and feeling large because of lack of estimation skill. By measurement, you can increase the estimation accuracy and reduce the motivation-less state.
