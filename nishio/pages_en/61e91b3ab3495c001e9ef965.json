(Column) You may find a relationship later
Originally footnote *8 of [(5.1.1.5) Do not mind duplication].

I had two pieces and take the latter. This column explains the reason.

	Move related pieces closer
	Move pieces which may related closer

You can not know in advance whether pieces have a relationship or not. You may [find a relationship] later. 

At first, you come up with a subtle feeling. You feel two pieces may be related. However, you do not have confidence. You do not have a reason why they are related.

After that, as you gather various information, the feeling of a relationship becomes stronger gradually. 

Finally, you find the reason why they are related. Now you can explain to others they are related. 

Belief begins in a subtle shape and gradually hardens. 

In the process of the KJ method, you do not need to show evidence of a relationship. Asking for a firm relationship from the beginning is the same kind of mistake as trying to write a high-quality complete sentence from the beginning.
