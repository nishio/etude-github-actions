 What we do today
 My head hurts. I should go buy some garbage bags for now. Convenience store bags filled with garbage are scattered all over the room.
 
 Aspirin (Bufferin) for the first time in my life. Hmmm...it has a side effect of suppressing the secretion of the protective mucous membrane of the stomach wall, so if I take too much, I could get a stomach ulcer or something. Well, I haven't had alcohol for a while, so I should be fine.
 
 My head was feeling a little tired, so I went to bed for a while, and then it started to get really cold. I thought maybe I turned off the heater because it was warm yesterday, but when I looked at the thermometer, it was 22 degrees Celsius. It was 22 degrees Celsius. It's simply something wrong with my body.
 
 It's already 6:30 p.m. while I'm muffling myself and sleeping. Oh, no, I failed to pick up the key.

 *1234658229*XBox LIVE
 I was looking at the <a href="http://ikunozama.appspot.com/price_range/2000/to/4000/">price range display</a> feature I recently added to test it, and I saw "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp /product/B000B5MD3G?ie=UTF8&tag=nh06-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000B5MD3G">Xbox LIVE 2100 Points Card</a> I thought "I can't buy this card from Japan because it's related to games", but when I added it to my cart and proceeded to checkout, surprisingly I found that I could buy it. 2100 points is 2243 yen and 4200 points is 4355 yen, which is about 30% off compared to Japan where 1400 points is 2100 yen. I think it's about 30% off, but I wonder if this is a good deal. I don't have an XBox myself, so I don't know how much need there is for it or how much people are paying for it in Japan, but if anyone thinks "Oh, this is a good deal! I don't know how much people are looking for and how much they are willing to pay for it in Japan, but if anyone thinks it's a good deal, I'll put it on my top recommended products list.
