quantum computer
Good summary on quantum annealing http://www.stat.phys.titech.ac.jp/~nishimori/QA/q-annealing.html

In 1994, Shore's algorithm was proposed that seemed to be able to do prime factorization faster than a normal computer, and now, more than 20 years later, there are [59 algorithms http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/]. It depends on one's perspective whether one thinks, "It can do a lot of things," or "It took 20 years to finally come up with 59 algorithms.
