Bad Patterns of Group Formation
[Bad Patterns] in [Group Formation]
　The state of "lots of data, lots of pain."
　So, "reduce the number of pieces you see and reduce the pain by bundling them with a nameplate.
　This is the purpose of "organizing a group"
　Bad example
　　Lots and lots of labels collected from lots of employees.
　　Lots of labels regarding current dissatisfaction, let's collect these.
　　Let's put up a front called "Current Complaints."
　Why it's bad
　　If we fold that group, we'll only have abstract information about "dissatisfaction with the status quo."
　　Is "I'm not happy with the way things are" useful information? No, it's not.
　　If you want to know specifics, you need to open a bundle.
　　　It's a pain to bundle and open, and it stays open.
　　　It defeats the purpose of "compressing the number of sheets."
　What's wrong.
　　>There are a lot of labels regarding current dissatisfaction, let's collect these.
　　[" regarding current dissatisfaction].
　　I'm not looking at the relationship between the two labels, I'm collecting them by their similarity to the original concept of "current dissatisfaction" in my head.
	　　["There's a lot of them. Let's collect them."]
	　　A group with many members is suddenly being created.
　Stuck in the phase of putting up a nameplate.
		How do I put a good nameplate on it?"
　"What can I say other than 'the current state of affairs'?"
　　I'm failing at collecting labels for the front of the house, so I can't put a "good front" on it.
