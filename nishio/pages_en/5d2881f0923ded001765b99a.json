Information-Geometric Optimization
When converting an objective function defined in the search space to a function defined in the parameter space, the method of taking the expectation value was generally used in the past, but since the average is not invariant to the mapping of the objective function by a monotonically increasing function, it was changed to a definition using quantiles.

	We present a canonical way to turn any smooth parametric family of probability distributions on an arbitrary search space 𝑋 into a continuous-time black-box optimization method on 𝑋, the [information-geometric optimization] ([IGO]) method.
	[Invariance] as a major design principle keeps the number of arbitrary choices to a minimum.
	The resulting [IGO flow] is the flow of an ordinary differential equation conducting the [natural gradient ascent] of an adaptive, time-dependent transformation of the objective function. 
	It makes no particular assumptions on the objective function to be optimized.
	The IGO method produces explicit [IGO algorithms] through time discretization. 
	It naturally recovers versions of known algorithms and offers a systematic way to derive new ones.
		In continuous search spaces, IGO algorithms take a form related to [natural evolution strategies] ([NES]).
		The [cross-entropy method] is recovered in a particular case with a large time step, and can be extended into a smoothed, parametrization-independent maximum likelihood update (IGO-ML).
		When applied to the family of Gaussian distributions on [$ R^d], the IGO framework recovers a version of the well-known [CMA-ES] algorithm and of [xNES].
		For the family of [Bernoulli distributions] on [$ \{0, 1\}^d], we recover the [seminal PBIL] algorithm and [cGA].
		For the distributions of restricted Boltzmann machines, we naturally obtain a novel algorithm for discrete optimization on [$ \{0, 1\}^d].
	All these algorithms are natural instances of, and unified under, the single information-geometric optimization framework.
	The IGO method achieves, thanks to its intrinsic formulation, maximal invariance properties:
		invariance under reparametrization of the search space 𝑋, 
		under a change of parameters of the probability distribution, 
		and under increasing transformation of the function to be optimized.
		The latter is achieved through an adaptive, quantile-based formulation of the objective.
	Theoretical considerations strongly suggest that IGO algorithms are essentially characterized by a minimal change of the distribution over time. Therefore they have minimal loss in diversity through the course of optimization, provided the initial diversity is high. First experiments using restricted Boltzmann machines confirm this insight. As a simple consequence, IGO seems to provide, from information theory, an elegant way to simultaneously explore several valleys of a fitness landscape in a single run.

 	Thus it hopefully provides better robustness w.r.t. changes in the presentation of a problem.
 For continuous search spaces, invariance under translation of the coordinate system is standard in optimization.

		quasi-Newton methods (Deuflhard, 2011)
	 [covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy], [CMA-ES] (Hansen and Ostermeier, 2001; Hansen and Auger, 2014)
	These are invariants to the search space
	On the other hand, monotonically increasing transformations for the objective function

	iteratively update a probability distribution [$ 𝑃_\theta] defined on 𝑋, parametrized by a set of parameters [$ \theta]
		This probability distribution can be called a [belief] about the solution (in the sense of [POMDP], etc.).

		Method 1: The cross-entropy method consists in taking 𝜃 minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between 𝑃𝜃 and the indicator of the best points according to 𝑓
  	What is indicator of the best points according to f?
		Method 2: one can transfer the objective function 𝑓 to the space of parameters 𝜃 by taking the average of 𝑓 under 𝑃𝜃, seen as a function of 𝜃.
			This average is a new function from an Euclidian space to R and is minimal when 𝑃𝜃 is concentrated on minima of 𝑓. 
				Is it assumed that theta is one dimensional?
				If not, you can still solve it using the gradient method.

		To make f a function over theta instead of X, you can take the expected value in theta.
