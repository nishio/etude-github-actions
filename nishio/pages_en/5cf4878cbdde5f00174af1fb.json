The downside of thin libraries
code:python
 import slackweb
 client = slackweb.Slack(url="...")
 client.notify(text="Hello!")

code:python
 import requests
	requests.post(url, json=dict(text="Hello!"))

There's a problem that makes it hard to see these lower layers.
The layers below change slowly and the layers above change quickly, so in gaining knowledge that is less likely to [become] obsolete, we should dig into the lower layers, but the thin libraries in between prevent this.
