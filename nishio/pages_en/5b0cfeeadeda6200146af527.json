	is created with the title `nishio-title`.

	After three months [social triggers] reminded me of this page.
 	>I don't want to be a co-editor, but I sometimes feel like commenting a little bit when I read "Hashimoto Shokai" or "Yasukazu Nishio's Scrapbox". [Twitter @rashita2 https://twitter.com/rashita2/status/1031389566161154053]
 	The above design is a proposal to create a collaborative editing project for comments, but users do not like their writing to be distributed and would prefer it to be in their own project
  It is no different from any other page to write "what I think of the outside information", even if it is a comment, and I don't like it to be stored in another place just because it was a comment on a page of another Scrapbox project #Pocket One Principle
  Is there a similar way to make comments in my project?
  	Wouldn't it be nice if there was a service that would crawl the pre-subscribed Scrapbox projects once a day and notify you if they contain the keywords you specify?
 			Just put in ego-search-like keywords.

	Six more months after the above, [/rashitamemo/Scrapbox for output and Scrapbox for comments] reminded me
		In this proposal, we were talking about manually reprinting what we wanted comments on.
		I wrote a proposal to automatically reprint it here.
