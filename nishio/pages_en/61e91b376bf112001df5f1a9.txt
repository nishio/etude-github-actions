pattern discovery
	To find [common pattern] among [concrete] [fragment]s of information

---

	Footnote 41 for [(1.4.7.1) Generalization by pattern discovery]:
		In "[Learning methods of engineer]," I call this "pattern discovery" as "[induction]" using philosophical terms. However, many people recall the [mathematical induction] from the word "induction." Since the mathematical induction method is partly common and partly different in the concept of induction as the philosophical term, it confuses. To avoid confusion, I decided to avoid the word "induction."
		Footnote 42: [Henri Poincar√©]'s "[science and hypothesis]" is good to refer to the relationship between creating new knowledge and "[induction]" as a philosophical term.
