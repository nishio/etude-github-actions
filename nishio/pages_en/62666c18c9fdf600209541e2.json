Scrapbox Paradigm Shift
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1518167225521557505]: I think [Scrapbox] is definitely some kind of [paradigm shift], something I can't explain in one word what Scrapbox is. I've been using it alone for a long time, and this past year I started working on a multi-person project, and I feel like there's another paradigm shift. It's like "a conversation without the boundaries of synchronous asynchrony and without the linear constraints of a chat room.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1518168523918671872]: I guess you could say that the paradigm shift when you are alone is "I can save associative connections and when I am now trying to save associative connections, past associative connections are presented to you"...? Either way, it's a "increase the probability of unplanned gains" kind of thing, so it's hard to communicate to someone who hasn't experienced it.
