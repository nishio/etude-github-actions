 *1266666118*Dominion Life
 Just because your blog is all about Dominion doesn't mean your life is all about Dominion!
 
 It's just that there are Dominion stories that are easy to update when there are so many other things I can't write about, like the Unexplored Youth Boost conference and NDAs, and the blog has been slow to update because of so many other things I can't write about.
 
 I started BSW because I was invited by a community of my college classmates, but Dominion is booming in the community of unexplored youth alumni (mainly id:TOKOROTEN), and I found myself in http://twitter.g.hatena.ne.jp/retlet/20091231. I was in the state that I had joined the community. It's quite annoying because the means of communication are different in these three communities.

 Meat ranking in my brain
 >||
 Crab, mackerel, yellowtail, pufferfish, tuna, red meat, toro
 　　　Octopus, squid, canned mackerel
 　　　　　　　　　　　Shrimp Abalone
 　　　　　　　blue manna crab, Eriocheir sinensis (species of sand clam)
 　　　　　　　　　Birds Pigs Deer Cattle
 　　　　　　　　　　　　Hatsu, liver, sea chicken, bamboo shoots
 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　sea cucumber (Holothuroidea spp.)
 ||<
 Making a ranking is surprisingly difficult. It is clear what I dislike, though.
