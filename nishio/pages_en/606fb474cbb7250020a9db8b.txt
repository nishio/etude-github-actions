Is it beneficial to make the absurd visible?

[How would you like to see the constraints change?]
There is another meta-layer to this story, "Is it beneficial to visualize absurdity if the goal is to change constraint X under current constraints? Is it futile?" There is another axis, "Is it useful or futile to visualize the absurdity if the objective is to change constraint X under the current constraints?

The term "[how to change the constraints]" is [ambiguous] because it can refer to both this layer of "by what means the constraints are changed" and "in what form the constraints are changed".

[disadvantage visualization is a disadvantage].
