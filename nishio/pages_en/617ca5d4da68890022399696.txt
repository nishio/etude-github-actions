The fool calls the wise man hypocritical and does not imitate him, but he who imitates the wise man is the wise man.
　Stupid people hate smart people.
　They say things like, "You're just selling your name by embellishing the fact that you're giving away small profits for big profits."
　You say such things because your way of thinking and that of the wise are far apart
　Such a person would not seek to imitate the behavior of a wise man.
　But [the wise man is] the one who imitates the wise man.
See [Tsurezuregusa, Sec. 85].

[Hypocrisy.]
