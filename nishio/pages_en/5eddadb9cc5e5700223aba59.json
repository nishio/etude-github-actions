	What exactly does [the chewing task] entail?
		Check for documentation first.
		Next, perform a [word frequency of source code] analysis.
		Create a document that will serve as a guide.
		Read and understand the source code and write tests
		Refactoring
		Add functionality
	Having [a document to guide you] makes it easier to get back to your project if you forget what it is.
		Makes it easier for people who don't know what the project is about to participate
		It has to do with the recent "One person's project should become a multi-person project".
		Documentation is needed to involve others
 As the project progresses from the stage of coming up with the idea to the specifics, the documentation becomes more specific.
		Similar to what I wrote in [Prototypes and Proposals



[nishio.icon]Let's talk.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
What exactly is the [nishio.icon]chewing task?
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that chewing task?
[nishio.icon]Bite down on ideas and turn them into actionable actions.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that action?
[nishio.icon]How can we learn to understand this when we are in a state of not understanding it?
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that condition?
It's been a while since I've been away from the [nishio.icon]project, so I think I've forgotten a lot of things.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that project?
Not much documentation left on the [nishio.icon] project.
[nisbot.icon]What type of project is it?
[nishio.icon]A project that was left unattended after taking some shape
[nisbot.icon]Where is that project?
[nishio.icon] in a repository somewhere.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that repository?
I should [nishio.icon]document it, and maybe I'll write it.
[nisbot.icon]
>Projects that were left unattended after being shaped to some degree
Where is this project located?
[nishio.icon]NG
[nisbot.icon]What type of document is that document?
[nishio.icon]In fact, the ideal would be to have the internal structure of the project described, so that when you read it, you know where to tweak it when you make new improvements.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know about the project?
[nishio.icon]If there is documentation, you can read it, but there isn't.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that document?
[nishio.icon]I guess I'll just have to make it now while reading the source code.
[nisbot.icon]What type of source code is that?
[nishio.icon]I think it has a bizarre shape because I made it while experimenting with various things.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about that form?
Maybe we should refactor [nishio.icon].
[nisbot.icon]If there is documentation, you can read it, but there isn't.
How do you know about this document?
[nishio.icon]I heard the other day that it would be good to run a word frequency analysis on the source code and generate a model from that.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that source code?
[nishio.icon]I need to see if there is documentation first and read the source code to see if I can chew it up into concrete actions.
[nisbot.icon]Where can I find that document?
[nishio.icon]I don't know if it's there or not, so I'll check, that's the first task
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that task?
If not [nishio.icon], the next task is to apply word frequency analysis to the source code
[nisbot.icon]What type of task is that?
[nishio.icon] It's a task to make a rough model of the source code.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its source code?
Read [nishio.icon], understand the functionality, and then you can test code the functionality you understand for future refactoring.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that refactoring?
Should be done separately from [nishio.icon] feature additions. Refactoring should come first. I think there was a saying that expressed that...
[nisbot.icon]What type of refactoring is that?
[nishio.icon]To make the tangled code into a clean structure without changing the behavior of the code, so that you don't have to worry about it when you do a new modification.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about its structure?
[nishio.icon]Keep it simple
[nisbot.icon] It's a task to make a rough model of the source code.
Where can I find this source code?
[nishio.icon]NG
[nisbot.icon]
>I'll have to check to see if there is documentation first, and read the source code to see if I can chew it up into concrete actions.
What does this document look like?
[nishio.icon]It's a map. It's a rough guide that points you where to go.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]A guide will lower the cost of deciding on a Next Action. This is a value.
[nisbot.icon]What type of guide is that?
[nishio.icon]A guide that shows you where and how to fix things without having to re-read and re-understand the entire source code.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that guide?
[nishio.icon]Like a table of contents for a book
What is the relationship between the [nisbot.icon] project and the source code?
[nishio.icon]Source code, when properly updated, will continue to grow like a snake that repeatedly sheds its skin, and this living system is the project
Is [nisbot.icon] the project the same as the source code? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]To use an analogy, is a human being the same as a body? It is like saying that a dead person has the same body as a living person.
What happens to the source code when [nisbot.icon] projects?
[nishio.icon] to be updated
What happens to a project when [nisbot.icon] source code?
[nishio.icon]New ideas, user reactions, needs, and other growth sources besides the source code are created by moving the source code.
What is [nisbot.icon]between that source code and the project?
[nishio.icon]Putting that aside, "What exactly do I need to do about the chewing task?" As for the "chewing task," first check for documentation, then do word frequency analysis of the source code, create documentation that can be used as a guide, read and understand the source code, write tests, refactor it, and add functions, is that a good flow?
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that guide and the project?
[nishio.icon]Documentation that makes it easier for people who don't know or have forgotten what the project is about to participate in the project. Oh, well, it has to do with the other day's "One person's project should be a multi-person project".
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between the project and its documentation?
[nishio.icon]He said that documentation is necessary to get others involved.
Is [nisbot.icon] the document the same as the project? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]In a sense, is documentation more important than source code for a project to continue?
What happens to the document when [nisbot.icon] that project?
[nishio.icon]As the project progresses from the stage of coming up with the idea to the specifics, the documentation becomes more specific.
What happens to the project when [nisbot.icon] that document?
So [nishio.icon], the documentation is the support that keeps the project alive.
[nisbot.icon]What does that project look like?
[nishio.icon]Biological-like
What is [nisbot.icon]between the project and the documentation?
[nishio.icon]Bye-bye!
