Narrow observation range optimization

> Recently, I've been running into a lot of cases where I'm thinking, "If I do that, your time and effort might decrease by 2, but their time and effort will increase by 10, and there's no way they'll negotiate that way. ðŸ¤”
> He said it's also increasing the overall hassle and no one agrees with him here.
> I told him that I was going to do it, and he asked me, "So you mean you want me to leave it like this? I want you to realize that what I'm saying isn't rational. I want them to realize that what I am saying is not rational. You may be able to optimize the 3-meter radius, but the overall efficiency is going down.
	>If you still want to let them through, don't say, "They won't do it," but rather, "I'm really sorry for the trouble I've caused you. It's very time-consuming, isn't it? Yes, I understand. That's the point, please. Hira... Hira... Please forgive me." I told him that people won't move unless we ask them to do so with a very low attitude, but he didn't want to do that, so I said, "Well, let's just give up then! So we just gave up.
