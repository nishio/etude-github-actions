Tree or network" is a false dichotomy

　First, consider linear sentences.
　　[Reading order] is strongly prescribed.
　　Even in this form, there are [jump references] like "we'll discuss this later" or "as mentioned earlier."
　　The black arrows in this case correspond to the reading order
　The table of contents of a book is a typical [tree structure].
　　In this case, too, the order of reading is prescribed by page number, but on the other hand, it is assumed that the reader will look at the table of contents and start reading from the chapter or section that interests him or her.
　　　Allows readers to narrow their scope by interest
　　The black arrow in this case [topic inclusions].
　　　(Of course, there are authors who do not utilize the tree and give appropriate chapter titles for each appropriate amount of lazy writing.)
　Scrapbox-like [network structure] does not specify reading order.
　　I can create a pinned first page to read and link from there.
　　I don't ask readers to "read the whole thing."
　　　Read only the chapters that interest you" turns into "Read only the pages that interest you."
　　The black arrow in this case would be the equivalent of a jump reference.
　In other words?
　　I don't think "network structure or tree structure" is an appropriate cut-off point.
　　Even books with an expansive tree structure have links across chapters, anything can be called a network.
　　It may be characteristic of "the intensity of control over the order of reading."
