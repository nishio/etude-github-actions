Hypothesis that physical achievement restores MP
Hypothesis that physical attainment restores [MP
　Light work with physical deliverables
　　Mercari?
　manual or physical labor
　Is it important to be physically active?
　Is the achievement easy to observe?
　Is it good to be able to see "today's portion of the accomplishment" without crossing days?

　The counterargument that "accomplishment" simply restores
　The theory that washing dishes or cooking food has a better effect than, for example, completing a daily mission in a game.
　I think the daily missions in the game are becoming less effective as the same "achievement" is repeated over and over again, and the achievement itself is becoming tiring.
　　Similarly, people who don't usually wash dishes or cook dishes may feel a sense of accomplishment from doing so, but it may not be as effective for those who do it on a daily basis.
　　→ Isn't it necessary to "accomplish something out of the ordinary"?
　　Maybe not so much.
　　　Mental stability from doing the usual routine is likely.
