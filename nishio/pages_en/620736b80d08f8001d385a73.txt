Act only with honor.

Act only with honor.

You can trust them and they can trust you. Their honor, even if misunderstood, is the surest proof of their actions. For they always act in consideration of what they are. Therefore, it is better to argue with honorable people than to triumph over dishonorable people. They cannot be in contact with doomed people. For they have no hostages for righteousness. They have no true friendship, and their contracts, however severe they may seem, are not binding. For they have no sense of honor. For if honor does not restrain men, neither does virtue.
