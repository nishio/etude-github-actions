Belief that the strong win the competition.
There are those who believe that "the strong always win [competition]."
	My own experience of winning the competition reinforces this belief.
	Observing that the strong lose to competition through luck weakens them.
	If you yourself lose the competition,
		Thinking oneself weak -> [learned helplessness].
		I think I am strong, but luck and the world are not right, so I don't think I am valued correctly -> [lusantiman].

When this belief is strong, it creates the interpretation that "the reason we lose to competition is because we are weak."
	As a result, no matter what we observe, the belief that "the strong always win [competition]" will not be overridden
	[Positive feedback]

This is [interesting] because it is both a [human bug] that derails individual cognition and a [structural problem in the human system].
