Vicious Cycle of Problems and False Solutions
[Compendium of Problem Solving] p.389
	[FALSE RESOLUTION]
		The act of trying to solve a [problem] and instead reproducing the problem.

	situation
　　Something problem X is continuing.
　　I'm doing solution Y over and over to solve the problem.
　explanation
 　I did Y, but X continues."
 　From this observed fact, it is obvious that Y is not the correct solution (Y is a false solution)
 　　but for some reason, some people keep repeating Y as if it were a solution.
 　　　[madness of doing the same thing over and over again and hoping for a different result].
 　If this Y reproduces X, a [vicious cycle] occurs
