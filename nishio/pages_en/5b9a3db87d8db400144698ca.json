単純接触効果
>The mere exposure effect is an effect in which repeated contact (even under a threshold) increases liking and impressions of a person. Zajonc (1968).

>"Misattribution of perceptual [fluency]" theory
> "Continued contact with a stimulus increases familiarity with it by increasing processing efficiency at the level of perceptual information processing for the stimulus. This increase in familiarity is falsely attributed to a liking for the stimulus itself.
