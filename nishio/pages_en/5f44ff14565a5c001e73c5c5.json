The process of thinking about what "thinking" means
from [think].

What is "thinking" (and was asked by [Tomoya Tachikawa])?

Basic approach:.
	If you don't know the meaning of a word, you can observe how the word is used see: [the meaning of a word is the use of the word].
	→Look for examples of using "think" as a keyword on your Scrapbox.
	→Two used "think" itself, and four used keywords containing "think."

	There is already a page with "think" as a link.

			>When you get the words, you can use them to [think].
				Words are tools for thinking.
			>[Engelbart] saw language as a means for individuals to break down their perceptions of the world into "[concepts]" for modeling the world. Language is used to map [symbols] to these [concepts] and to consciously manipulate the [concepts]. Consciously manipulating these concepts, he believes, is "[thinking].
				Thinking = conscious [manipulation] of [concept].
					What is a concept?
					What is concept manipulation?
					What does it mean that the operation of a concept is conscious?

				>The diligent person who spends a day [reading a lot] gradually loses the ability to think for himself.
   myself
   	>Thinking" is a concept that corresponds to "combining" in "[output] becomes a degraded copy if it is rushed".
				In [Rushing to output results in a degraded copy], I wrote that "input merges with another input over time = the word is ripe.
	There is a link that contains "think."
		[Thinking Human]
			Name of Konosuke Matsushita's books
			Subtitled "Proposing a New View of Humanity, Seeking the True Way of Man."
			In other words, "think X" means
				"Advocating a New View of X."
				In Search of the True X Way."
		[Consider the abstract].
			This is just one specific example of an abstract I'm considering.
			Specifically, I'm trying to envision specific participants and what they would like to talk about.
			In this case, "thinking" means the following actions
				Create a set of fragmented facts and stories to talk about.
				Create pathways to connect them.
			Write it down to make it disappear, then slowly figure out how to connect it.
		[Writing and thinking]
			This links to multiple pages
			[Kazuhiro Shiozawa's [book review].
				> Write first instead of trying to write after you understand
    > Writing allows you to view your thoughts from a moment ago objectively.
    View thoughts objectively
    	Thought [objectification].
		[Consider the duality].
			This is linked to [blind spot card].
			Blind spot cards collect "[blind spot]".
			What did you want to happen by it?
				Thinking develops by noticing blind spots.
			This is [people interpreting the oracle].
			Drawing [tarot] cards is an "oracle-giving device."
				Whether or not it is actually an oracle is immaterial.
				Breaking the stalemate of thought by trying to find a connection to the current situation by considering it to be an oracle
					[Dielectric breakdown] by [associative connection]
				Just as a [placebo] can have an effect without actually having a medicinal effect.
			This "think dual" specifically means "map to the space of duals and think there".
				It is a kind of mapping to [metaphor space] by [analogy] and developing it there and then pulling it back when you discard whether it is a dual or not.

	The flow of this page itself is a concrete example of "thinking
	summary
 	Engelbart, "Thinking = conscious manipulation of concepts."
 	An input merges with another input over time = the word is ripe
 		Schopenhauer called this "thinking," interpreted by Nishio
 	Nishio interprets Konosuke Matsushita's idea that "thinking X" means "creating a new way of looking at X."
		Nishio calls it "thinking" to find the connections between the written fragments and create the appropriate story
		Writing down thoughts objectifies them.
			Concepts become consciously manipulable objects.
			Writing it out and making it indelible allows for "time to set aside and merge it with another".
			By writing it down and making it an object, you can get a different perspective on it.
		Write down your thought process.
			It does not directly solve another problem in the future, but it can be mapped by analogy
			Mapping by analogy, developing, and pulling back provides a solution to a new problem
			This realization that "the analogy holds" is "binding."
	This page actually combines a number of previous pages

To summarize in one line.
	Thinking = combining one piece of information with another
		If they happen to combine, they are called "noticed."
			Deliberately trying to cause coupling is "thinking."
			This is Engelbart's "thinking = conscious manipulation of concepts."
		There are a variety of specific ways to intentionally cause bonding.
			Write down your thoughts so that you can objectify them and view them from a different perspective
			Writing information out makes it indelible and allows it to be combined with another over time
				Nowadays, by writing it down in a digital way, it can be found in a search.
			There are ways to spread it out after the bonding has occurred.
				Use analogical binding to map the problem to another space, develop it there, and then pull it back.
				A type of coupling "[association]" can be electronically recorded and electronically explored: [2-hop link].
