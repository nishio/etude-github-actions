Writing a book

 I'm getting more and more questions and advice on how to write a book, but I sense a discrepancy in the meaning of the term "[writing a book]".
 I think people agree with the idea that it is not possible to output something that is 100% complete from the beginning, but I think they still have the image of "output something that is about 95% complete, review it a little bit at 5%, and it's done.
 Only writings of a somewhat smaller scale can do that.
 Either it's just enough to hold the whole picture in your brain, or it's a lot of it, but the content is skimpy.
 Books are the most cognitively burdensome part of the process, where you have to design a structure that is integrated as a whole, based on the premise that the brain cannot hold the entire detailed picture.
 However, I may be setting the bar too high, as there are many books out there that are like baby food, just pouring unstructured, ground-up information into one's mouth.
 I personally think that such books are not worth the effort, because the effort to write them is small but the [obsolescence] rate is also fast.
