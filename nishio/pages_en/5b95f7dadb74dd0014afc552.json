Oh, can you manage a narrowed down search of their ID and your ID?

 Apparently there is a study showing that people with autism spectrum syndrome secrete less melatonin, which may be related to less expression of the gene that encodes the last enzyme in the melatonin synthesis system: http://bit.ly/Lboc [T https://twitter.com /nishio/status/3882162346]

 Autistic children are more likely to have their cortisol circadian rhythms disrupted by stress, according to: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16005570
 	I thought circadian rhythm was melatonin, but I guess cortisol is involved too. I'll do some more research. [T https://twitter.com/nishio/status/3877878035]
	 Melatonin is a pacemaker rhythm, but it does not directly drive the sleep-wake rhythm, but adrenaline, serotonin, and cortisol do the same, and they raise and lower body temperature. Waking up is triggered by elevated cortisol secretion, apparently. [T https://twitter.com/nishio/status/3878101909]
	 If that is the case, it is very important that the light comes on at about the time I wake up. I guess I'll have to work something out so that the lights come on in the morning. [T https://twitter.com/nishio/status/3878127422]

	>kuni3344: I wonder if histamine and the following have a significant effect on arousal:http://www.coe.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/integr-life/findings/research081201.html
 @kuni3344 That URL is about clock gene resetting, so it has nothing to do with how arousal is caused by the body clock. If you have a source for the histamine-related story, please let me know. [t https://twitter.com/nishio/status/3881158700]
	>Maybe I'm missing it? It used to be on the website of Dr. Hideo Arita of Toho University: "The TM nuclear HA nerve is a third arousal system because it is not integrated in series within these dorsal and ventral pathways. In fact, there is a direct projection from the TM nuclear HA nerve to the cortex (mainly to the frontal and temporal lobes), and the nerve shows state-dependent activity changes (sustained firing at 2-4 Hz during wakefulness and activity suppression during sleep3)), which means that there is a mechanism for the HA nerve to directly activate the cortex (Figure). However, not only that, the TM nucleus HA nerves project to the dorsal pathway, the thalamic nonspecific nucleus, and the TM nucleus HA nerves project to the dorsal pathway, the thalamic nonspecific nucleus and the midbrain bridge capsule ACh nerve, as well as to the ventral pathway, the Meynert basal ganglia ACh nerve and the blue nucleus NA nerve, through their ascending brainstem reticular activating system also drive the arousal system.
 @kuni3344 I see, histamine neurons (HA) localized in the nodal papillary nucleus (TM) activate the cortex at 2~4 Hz during wakefulness. Does taking antihistamines make you sleepy because they suppress HA activity? [t https://twitter.com/nishio/status/3881785462]
	> "In other words, it directly or indirectly affects all brain structures involved in arousal, and is involved in cortical activation." I think that the modulation of HA in relation to blood flow in the frontal lobe, where HA nerves are the integrative regulators of energy metabolism, is a big part of what is involved in arousal.
 @kuni3344 Since the TM itself only drives the arousal system and does not create its own circadian cycle, I wonder if it needs to receive information from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) or pineal gland (PB) about "when to wake up", is this mediated by melatonin? [t https://twitter.com/nishio/status/3882047855]
	>I think it is leptin that activates that HA nerve, and SOCS3 of STAT3-SOCS3 that ossifies inhibits leptin, and it is TGF-beta and activin that affect it here. I am following that as an important part of autism as well.
 @kuni3344 I see, that's where the URL you just mentioned leads to. [t https://twitter.com/nishio/status/3882122519]
	>I don't know exactly, but there is also degradation of adenosine, a sleep inducing substance that is antagonized by TM, and I suspect that the degradation enzyme is involved in RNA editing, and the suppression of the enzyme by BCL-6, which I believe is downstream of STAT3, may also have something to do with it.
 @kuni3344 I've always wondered how adrenal cortisol secretion is rhythmic, but I guess TGF-beta causes transcriptional induction of DEC1, which resets the adrenal and other peripheral clocks, which in turn controls the circadian cycle of cortisol. One mystery solved. [t https://twitter.com/nishio/status/3882375437]
 >I know I am an amateur, but you have a great understanding! Also, STAT3-SOCS3 oscillations are affected by NOTCH oscillations, which are also related to the development of the left and right brain, and the difference between right-brain and left-brain types of autism is caused by the signals during the developmental period here.
