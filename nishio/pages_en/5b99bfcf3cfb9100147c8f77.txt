color bath effect
The effect is that when you are asked to "answer the red things you have seen in the past," it is difficult to answer, but if you are conscious of looking for red things, you will see a lot of red things. This effect was introduced in the article "[Kogu].

>Before I leave the house in the morning, I decide on my "lucky color of the day". Red? Blue? Yellow? It can be any color. For example, "Red today! and go to work as usual. Then, commute to work as usual. Then, you see a lot of red cars today. ...... You don't know what it is, but strangely you see a lot of red cars. You also see red outdoor billboard advertisements. This is the color bus effect.

As one of the "tools to get information into your head," the book introduces a technique that allows you to discover a variety of information in a city that would otherwise look "the same as usual" by setting a different "angle" in terms of color.

>The Color Bus is a tool that teaches us that we can expand the range of our discoveries by focusing our attention on a different genre of work.

It is often spoken of as a "psychological term" without exhibiting it, but I have researched [article http://www.kariness.com/entry/2018/02/05/インターネットで偉くなった "Color Bus Effect"] to the effect that it is a hoax.
There is no reference to the "color bath effect" on the Internet before "kōgu" and no mention of it being a psychological term in "kōgu," which appears to be the source.
