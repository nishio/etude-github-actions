A
 Thoughts.
 　having not the slightest idea
 　N=100 in a directed graph
 　Question for expected value. Expected value DP?
 　When everything is in pieces, you can have 2^100 different states.
 　Find and sum for each independent component?
 Official Explanation
 　[https://gyazo.com/b766b42c3b51dfb5c4c0a0df9f8f42c9]
 　The "number of operations" is the number of times this table is added horizontally
  　[Times are sums].
  add vertically instead of horizontally
  	[Sum of f(x,y) per x is sum of f(x,y) per y]
  　[Change order of addition]
  　[The expected value of a sum is the sum of its expected values.]

C
	Thoughts.
	　I want 0 or less for ball 1, 1 or less for ball 2, and k or less for k-1.
	　Shave off the overhang?
	　　That would be too easy.
	　Cutting off the overhang is not the shortest way.
	　　"If Robot v. exists."
	　　You can disable the whole thing if you destroy it beforehand.
	　　Just rewrite one ball to one larger value.
	　　　Call that ball and it's all null and void.
	　　　This is a sufficient condition and we can cut more.
	　No need to count up if the robot is already destined to be destroyed by another robot.
	　　Need a lightweight determination of whether the section is covered.
	　　　Sort by (tip, +1) and (tail, -1) in a list
	　　　Covered if cumulative summed to linear order and nonzero.
	　　　Related [Imosu Law].
	　　→37WA
	Official Explanation
	　I'm not sure.

	 >C:A robot with A ≤ B can either a) reduce B so that it cannot reach 0 or b) move the right robot to destroy it.
  > a is used in at most one location. b costs 1 per ball. balls used in a are reused in b
