ABC195D RE
	Typical construction of the greed method [greed from the one with fewer options].
 	The smallest box has the fewest options for the luggage it can hold.
 	Considering the case of one box, it is optimal to put in the largest value X that can be put in.
 	一般の場合、
 		If the optimal solution does not include X, then exchanging X for X increases its value, which is a contradiction
 			→ thus X is always included in the optimal solution.
 		If there is an optimal solution where X is not in the smallest box, it is optimal to exchange it for a package in the smallest box.
 		Therefore, even if we decide to put X in the smallest box, we are guaranteed to obtain an optimal solution.
　Finding the largest of those satisfying the conditions in a large-size comparison can be done in logarithmic order with Range max in a segment tree, but for this problem constraint, even 50x50x50 is not a large size, so it is done naively.
