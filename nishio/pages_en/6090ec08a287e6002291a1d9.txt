 *1322469099* Naive Bayes implemented.
 From the top, the true output probability, a sample of latent variables and outputs (5 outputs per latent variable), the training data (a pair of latent variables and outputs), the output probability after training on that data, and the latent variable guessed from another output series based on that. the top of the three is the true latent variable, the middle is the The middle one is the output from it, and the bottom one is the latent variable inferred by looking at the output alone. When the output probabilities are so neatly separated, the guesses are all neatly correct.

 However, if the output probabilities overlap significantly, a discrimination error will still occur.

 I tried to increase the amount of training data, but there is not enough information to successfully identify the output (blue and purple) from both clusters.
