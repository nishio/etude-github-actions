(Column) SMART criteria
Related to [(1.2.2.1) Clarify the goal], [SMART criteria] give us a useful viewpoint to the quality of goal settings. It appears in 1981.

It is called SMART, taking the initials os Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Time-related. I explain these 5 items briefly as follows.

 [* Specific]: Specific areas to be improved are clear
 [* Measurable]: There is an amount, or at least an indicator showing progress
 [* Assignable]: It is clear who is going to execute the plan
 [* Realistic]: Realistically achievable, given resources necessary for the implementation
 [* Time-related]: When is the result obtained

This criterion is for organizational goal setting. When you use it for your individual goal setting, it is somewhat over spec. To think you must fit these standards, setting a goal itself becomes a psychological burden. I recommend using the standards to help to understand which goals are bad.

 *2 Sometimes A corresponds Achievable (realistically achievable, given necessary resources) and R corresponds Responsible (it is clear who is responsible for executing the plan). Although A and R exchanged each other,  the concept of five factors are almost the same.
