External Links
	`javascript: '[' + document.title + ' ' + location.href + ']\n'`
  The script is bookmarked under the name sca, and by typing sca in the URL bar and invoking the bookmarklet, it creates a Scrapbox-style link.
  This is a derivative of a bookmarklet I've been using for a long time that generates HTML a tags.

	Books
 	Use the core of the book title as the title (remove the subtitle if it doesn't seem necessary, e.g. `Lean Startup`)
  Post an image of the book's shadow
  Put the full title below it, including the subtitle, etc., and [link to] the keyword-ish part.
		Put a link to Amazon under it.
