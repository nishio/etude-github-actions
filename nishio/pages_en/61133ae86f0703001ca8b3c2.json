 I hoped that if we overlapped, we would be a group.
 I was hoping that when you click on a sticky in a group, it would be a click on the sticky, not a click on the group.
 　[nishio.icon]I think this is true.

 Don't you have a click here indicator?"
 Drag and drop of groups in Windows environment is also a unique display
 It would be nice to see a video of you doing it.
