Appointments with people are compulsory.
When I heard that [personal trainer]'s job is to "support you as best I can" and "not let you skip out," I thought about how [Ring Fit Adventure] has supported you as best I can, but I've skipped out on it....

And they told me that I had to pay monthly to continue, but unfortunately, I skip it even if I pay monthly.
　Perhaps when you pay the monthly dues, you realize it's already a [sunk cost].
　　They recognize that it is something they cannot get back whether they go to the gym or not, and they ignore it completely.
　So even if I pay a monthly membership fee, I don't go to the gym because it's a hassle because it's a "go to the gym to exercise or not" comparison and it's a hassle.

Looking back, I once paid a monthly fee for a gym and only went once in three months, but I consistently went to an English conversation school without skipping a single appointment because they made me set a specific date and time each time.... Is it essentially important to make an [appointment] with a human being....

[Continuity].

True story: I'm paying for the Asuken, BookScan and Owl stuff, but I'm not using it...
　I'm not sure when you can't open the app without just thinking of the name.
　It was Duolingo.
