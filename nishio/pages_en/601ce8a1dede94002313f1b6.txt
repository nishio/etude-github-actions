Don't ask questions related to keywords you haven't dug into.
If you're evaluating a question that takes multiple keywords in a sum, when one of the keywords is dangling higher than the other, you'll get a question that takes multiple keywords before you can dig into the newly emerged keyword.

I think you should min.

Create a script that will pour in user input from the logs and take statistics,
	We can check to see if some of the conditions are met as part of that.
	When the sample log was poured, there were 10 infringements, but by setting the main evaluation to min, there were 1 infringement, and by setting the score for the sum to 0.01, there were 0.
	This last adjustment is inappropriate for some score ranges and needs to be better.
