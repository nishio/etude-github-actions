They're swapping.
A and B are discussing
 B "A is changing the subject!"

Conversation between C and D who were watching
 C "B uses the term 'switched,' but A did not intentionally switch, but simply 'switched' unconsciously because A is incompetent at maintaining logical consistency? Isn't this a case of Hanlon's Razor's 'Don't find malice in what can be explained by incompetence'?"
 D: "I think you're right, but by that logic, 'A is just unconsciously confusing the two words because he's incompetent at recognizing the impact of the difference between "switched" and "switched" on others, and he's not intentionally "finding malice" in what he can explain with incompetence. 'Na' is equally valid, so it's a boomerang for C."
 C "Indeed. By the way, the logic of 'unconsciously hurting people because of their incompetence in recognizing the impact of their word choice on others', boomerangs on both of us who use the word 'incompetent' on others without any hesitation."

It turned out to be quite a grand boomerang.
