not mind about duplicates
When it comes to information, it's better not to worry about duplication than to pay the cost and lose the opportunity.
　[May be duplicated]
　[No fear of duplication].
　[Don't worry about duplicates, just write them down].
　[Duplicate check]
but what about the physical?

When you can't determine if there is a duplicate, is [what you can't find the same as what you can't find]?
What if a duplicate is found after the fact?
