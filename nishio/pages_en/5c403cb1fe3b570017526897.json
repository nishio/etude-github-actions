Will the ability to find it still be necessary 10 years from now?
[The Intellectual Production of Engineers] p.20

Is [the ability to find] still necessary 10 years from now?
	When paper books were the primary source of information, it was important to know where in the book to find what you were looking for.
	[Search] technology has advanced to the point where the cost of finding what you need in electronic information has dropped dramatically.
	In addition, the emergence of web services (Note 1) that allow users to post issues they want to solve and other users to post their solutions has made it possible to find solutions to specific programming issues with a fairly high probability of success when searching for them.
	Advances in technology are lowering [the cost of information gathering]. Most of the books and articles I mention in this book have been digitized and can be searched electronically from a PC or tablet device. New means of [gathering information] have also been created, such as "searching in English and looking at question-and-answer websites.
	In the days of paper books, the ability to [get the big picture] and think, "[it should be] around here," was very important, and I am not sure if that will still be true 10 years from now.
	However, since "search" is a technology for finding "what someone else has experienced and written about," it is impossible to find answers for "what no one has experienced yet. If the cost of gathering information on "what someone else has experienced" becomes cheaper and cheaper, people will be able to get through it faster, and more people will work on "what no one has experienced yet.

	Note 1 As of 2018, I specifically envision Stack Overflow in English-speaking countries. So I also envision "search" as an English-language search.
