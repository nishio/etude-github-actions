　Experiment with importing content
	　I've been experimenting with that for a while now because I thought the English Dominion wiki was CC-BY-NC-SA and could be imported with impunity in a public project.

　Since the original content was a wiki, I imported it in a way that made use of its links, but there were quite a few links that said "link to X but display Y", so I couldn't import it perfectly.
　But, it doesn't feel subjectively bad in terms of working within that project.

	I had a feeling that importing content mechanically would be iffy, but maybe there isn't much of a problem with that link being somewhat broken when importing something with links.
 　When you have a link called FooBar and a link called FooBar|Baz, it is easy in Scrapbox to merge them after the fact.
 　You can also notice that there are links with similar notations in the suggestion when entering a link.
 　I mean, "no link at all" is a problem, but if you have some, it doesn't matter too much if it breaks a little.

 In light of this, it would be surprisingly comfortable to automatically generate fewer links when importing text without links.
 　If there are too many pages (like 100 pages with a certain keyword as a link), it's a problem, but as long as it doesn't happen, it may be surprisingly comfortable.
　 If you make a link to "a repeated string of text, but it appears less than 7 times in 100 pages of text" or something like that, an automatic link could work surprisingly well.

When [Kozaneba+Scrapbox] is finished, let's write a script!
