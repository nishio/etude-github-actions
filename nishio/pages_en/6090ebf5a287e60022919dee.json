 *1203646513* Rush Ride
 
 A person was caught in front of me right now. He was beautifully cut in half and Momotaro came out from inside. I'm more scared of Oel, who just stuck his hand in and let it get caught when the door was about to open and close again. He was fine.
 
 *1203651488*[1000speakers]We made the timetable for the 2nd
 Please click here: http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:2
 
 We will have IRC on one of the screens since we have two screens this time, but it would be convenient to have a non-cluttered announcement timer app to put it above or below IRC. Is there one that would be just right?
 
 *1203651961* just noticed
 1000 Speakers Conference tomorrow, lots of Java presentations!
 I mean, is java-ja about to take over? I'm scared stiff!
 
 *1203660987*Presentation method without the person in question
