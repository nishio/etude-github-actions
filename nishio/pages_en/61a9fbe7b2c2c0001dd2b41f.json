When talking to others
　Accept the whole person in that moment.
　I'll try to use their words to describe it.
　Putting other things on the back burner in order to focus on one thing.
　　We don't agree on everything."
　　Any system can be clearly expressed (formalized) in terms of a single point.
　That "point" is not the same in relation to other things.
　　There's another implication in the later part of the story.
　　The "different" is clear. So what is "the same"?
　　　What in the world can be "that point" of "commonness" in terms of moving across several clear expressions (formulations)?
　That's not a public commitment.
　　[nishio.icon]I mean it's not a common part.
　　A strange order reacting to various explicit expressions (formulations)
　　　Converting expressions is a painstaking process
　　No single consistent pattern would be able to encompass the entirety of "the point"
　When something comes to mind, wait quietly until the words come out.
　　If you get interrupted in the middle, you forget even "exactly what you were going to say".

	Eugene Gendlin: "We should be able to cross all three."

phenomenology
　Eugene Gendlin, "The Phenomenologist Had the Other Half of My Method."
　　I knew that "a point" was a clear expression (formulation) of this.
　　 [nishio.icon]I'd like to know the original text.
　　[nishio.icon]Three crossings are half the story, phenomenology is the other half.
　　Criticism that Sartre and the Hegelian school did not find what Merleau-Ponty found in "function" and "refinement".
　　hussar
　　How "conflicted approach" can "lift
　　　[nishio.icon]The "lifting" of "cessation" in dialectics.

Three.
　[nishio.icon]If you have three, that's not "half.
　Dilthey [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Dilthey Wilhelm Dilthey - Wikipedia]
 　[Understanding is creation.]
 　For Dilthey, the experiential process is understanding
 　Understanding that we are created within
 　They are examples of what it is about, because individual advances can create more of the other
 　　[nishio.icon]You're talking about the IOFI principle.

Should I also explain Hegel's story lightly?
phenomenology
[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/現象学 Phenomenology - Wikipedia]
	Hegel (1770 - 1831) published his work "[Phenomenology of Spirit]" [Dialectical Phenomenology] in 1807.
　Husserl (1859 - 1938) proposed [transcendental phenomenology].
	Martin Heidegger (1889 - 1976) [hermeneutic phenomenology].


Phenomenology is some kind of progress in the thinking stage
　Experience Process and Meaning Creation Raises Seven New Advances
　　[nishio.icon]I want to explain what this is.

Carl Rogers
　How new consciousness can be collated against organismic experience to validate emerging oppressions
　　He "searched for the corresponding truth."
　Eugene Gendlin.
　　another way
　　　Instead of looking for certain experiences prior to symbolization
　　　Several steps
　　　　It became the "Experience Process Scale."

Carl Rogers
　On becoming a Person

Steps Teaching Method
　Now called Focusing.
　Psychotherapy is failing to teach how to do it.
　Prefer to give expertise

[Szikszentmihalyi]
　For me, [Chicxentmihai] is more appropriate.
　Questions about things
  Die Frage nach dem Ding.: Heidegger,
		[The Question Concerning the Thing: On Kant's Doctrine of the Transcendental Principles (New Heidegger Research) https://amzn.to/3Em9lu4]
		　You write that Heidegger thanked you with a nice afterword.

　　　Not this way?
　　The former, from the table of contents, looks like Eugene Gendlin won't be showing up.

	Many philosophers are
　Avoiding physics for fear of bringing reductionism into philosophy
　Avoid bringing in psychology and avoid human experiential processes.
　Heidegger believed that everything had to be brought in.
　　[nishio.icon]I agree, and I think philosophers who want to create something historically valuable in our time should study programming (polemic).
　　Statehood, not emotion
　　"Dwelling," "statehood," misunderstood.
　　Difficult to understand that "investiture" has meaning in "mood."
　　Difficult to see that "home - thinking" is found and implemented
　　Heidegger left phenomenology and attributed events to "history"
　　　As a result, the "phenomenon" has become inseparable from language and history.
　　　Many people misinterpreted that as "every experience is an old idea."
　　　Heidegger believed that history occurs in "dwelling
　　　Thinking-Dwelling."
　Phenomena are not isolated; all experience is dependent
　Failure to assume that there is a neutral, uninterpreted "phenomenon"
　　It went on to assume that every experience derives entirely from an implicit assumption that can only be broken by discontinuity
　　　[nishio.icon]I'm not sure, do you have the original text?
　Overlooking illogical transitions.
　When we understand exactly the complexity of the formation, when it transcends its form
　　When you don't understand it, all you can do is quote it.
　　　[nishio.icon]That's exactly me right now.
　　To understand is to "dwell-think" "within" the form
　　　This is a more accurate understanding than "keeping" the formality
　　　I associate [nishio.icon][defensive breakdown].
　　　　When you don't understand, all you can do is follow the pattern.
　　　　When understood accurately, the mold is broken.
　"Further -movement -seeking -order."
　　[nishio.icon]No, I wanted this to be written in the original language.
　　~ is intricate and complex rather than a consistent principle
　　Has more order (order) than formed form
　　　Coercively accurate feedback
　process of experience
　　Richer and wiser than fixed forms
　　It's called disorder.
　　It means both "no logical order"
　　The [Dionysian] experience of [Nietzsche
　　　More complex and sensible than the order formed
　　　Disorganized, but working in an orderly fashion.
　　There is a higher order and a lower order.
　　　[nishio.icon]Scrapbox's apparent disorder may be a higher order
　　　　The lower order here is, for example, "that the page is in a folder that represents its classification."
　　　　Scrapbox is richer and smarter than fixed hierarchical classifications."
　　　　I have a feeling you're right.
　　Finding "internal" differences "toward a voluntary process.
　[Derrida]'s "movement."
　　It's not arbitrary.
　　Individual movements end up as motionless contradictions.
　　He believes that the overthrow of order is disorder.
　When Dionysian experience works with pre-existing kinds of experience, it creates more order than ever before.
　　Not a mere lack of pre-existing order.
　　Nor is it the product of an order implicitly imposed and formed.
　Nietzsche's Body-Knowledge, Scheleiermacher, Dilthey, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger
　　This order can think and study itself, an intermittent reaffirmation of
　　Such thinking is not just fuzzy [felt sense
　　The work of understanding "precisely" transcends disconnection and form (distinctions and overall patterns).
