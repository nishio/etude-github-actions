	Daily I Ching: Three Hundred and Eighty-Four Stories
 [Kunio Takama]
 	> As a hobby and life's work, I am continuously studying public philosophy, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism. After 50 years of familiarity with the I Ching, he understands that the I Ching has a worldview that combines the goodness of [learning organizations] and [autonomous decentralized organizations] with the goodness of [controlled organizations], and teaches a way of life that adapts the moral values of self-interest and altruism to daily situations.
　　It was not Senge's "The Learning Organization" but another book with a similar name, I misunderstood at first.

It's interesting that the commentary says "in my own way."
　The question "What should I do?" is not appropriate; "How about this?" "What is the situation?" "What attitude should I take in this situation?" is better.
　If there are two options, divine each, both good or both bad
　　[nishio.icon][false choice between the two].
　　[There is a thousand paths.]
　Do not divine the same thing twice. If the meaning is not clear after divination, reverse the divination by saying, "Well, what if I don't do this?
　　[nishio.icon]This is interesting.
　Some people avoid dice, but my experience is that they produce a decent oracle, are easy to carry, and take very little time."
　　I didn't know they sold special dice for [nishio.icon].
