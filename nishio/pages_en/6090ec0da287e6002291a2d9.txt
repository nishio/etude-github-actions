 *1390932575* Some people claim a link between Fermi Estimation and Asperger's Syndrome, but it's pretty bad.
 Someone claimed that the Fermi estimation done in job interviews is used to select people with Asperger's Syndrome. I can't overlook this, so I'll refute it.

 First of all, here is a lie.
 >>
 Asperger's syndrome (high-functioning autism, PDD) is thought to be caused by a precisely congenital dysfunction of the frontal lobe, and
 <<
 Scientifically, the situation is still "various theories have not been settled". Incidentally, the first half of this slide explains it, so if you are interested, you can take a look at it. http://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-27390660
 
 
 The next point is that "subjects with dysfunction in the frontal lobe tend to give abnormal guesses," and therefore, by recruiting those who answer with abnormal values, one can select those with Asperger's syndrome.
 
 The ability to make rough estimates is important for programmers in their work. It is difficult to get a wrong value in a phase where you need to make a judgment, such as, "If it is used ~ times a day, it takes ~ms per time, so this algorithm is sufficient or we need to speed up the process. It is not enough to say, "There is a possibility that he/she is a competent programmer. Therefore, it is unreasonable to think that "we are actively trying to hire people who generate outlier values".
 
 
 Summary. Fermi estimation has nothing to do with Asperger's syndrome, and there is no reason to actively hire people who produce outliers.
 
 
 PS: You said it was hard to see where it was terrible, so I'll put it in one word: "where the source of the 'frontal lobe is the cause' that is the basis for his claim is unknown". I gave him pointers to papers that show differences in the activity of the spindle gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus (which are in the temporal lobe), but he does not provide a source as to why he is ignoring those papers and claiming that only the frontal lobe is responsible, and whether it is based on some reliable experimental results. I suspect that perhaps his brain paper is the source.
