apply anti-aliasing
 It doesn't look like [anti-aliasing] is on, but where do I turn it on?
 	Install [Post Processing Stack] in the Unity Store
 	Turn on antialiasing by referring to [Post-processing stack settings - Unity manual https://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/PostProcessing-Stack-SetUp.html Turn on anti-aliasing with reference to [Post-processing stack settings - Unity manual ].
