Dark Thin Circle Diagram

The actual boundary is not clear [blurry circle], but if it is drawn as a blurry circle, it is not well recognized by humans, so it is expressed as an overlap of dark and light areas.

Made for the explanation of [Aspects of Experience] in ["Experience Processes and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 3].
　I think [the story's intersection with Atom] was the catalyst.

The [nested set] depicted by ["is X" and "is not X" are compatible] and so on can be interpreted as a line drawing of the boundary between the two colors in this figure
　If it is essentially [a blurry circle], then the line is not real either.

[Neither "is X" nor "is not X" is correct.]
