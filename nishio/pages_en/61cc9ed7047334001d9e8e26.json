Double (game design)
Mechanisms to end the game efficiently
 https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/バックギャモン

In a game in which winning earns the underdog 1 point, no matter how small his probability of winning p is, the underdog does not resign because the expected value of winning points by continuing the game p exceeds the expected value of winning points when resigning 0.
Allow players to "propose doubling their winnings" here.
This proposal.
	When you get it...
 	相手の得る点数の期待値 [$ 2(1-p)]
 	Expected value of the score you get [$ 2p].
	I have to take it.
		It's treated as a resignation.
			相手の得る点数の期待値1
	 	Expected score you get 0
	Since [$ 2p - 2(1-p) = 2(2p-1) > -1 = 0 - 1] becomes true when [$ p < 1/4
