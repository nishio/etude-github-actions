Möbius function
There are three ways in which they are often mentioned

[Classical Möbius function]
	[$ \displaystyle \mu (n)=\left\{ \begin{array}{l}(-1)^k & (product of k distinct primes where n is k)\\0 &(otherwize)\end{array}\right.]
 When n=1, it is the "product of 0 distinct primes", so it is 1
 When n=4, it is not a "product of different prime numbers", so it is 0

The "[integer divisibility relation]" ([$ a \prec b, a | b ]) in which a divides b is [semi-ordered].
The abstraction that we focus on here is [adjacency algebra].
The adjoint algebra [zeta function] is a function such that ζ(a,b) = 1 for all nonempty intervals [$ [a, b]], and the Mobius function is the multiplicative inverse of the zeta function.

With a concrete example of this adjacency algebra,
　1: A whole positive integer with integer-divisibility relations
　 → attributed to classical Möbius function
　2: A subset of a finite set that contains a subset of the whole set ([power set]) with an inclusion relation
　 → Möbius function defined by the difference in set size
　 Leading to the [Inclusion-Description Principle
　3: Entering a greater-than or less-than relationship for the whole set of natural numbers
　　→0,0,...,0,-1,1
　　The zeta function corresponds to the cumulative sum, and the Möbius function corresponds to its inverse. [difference operator]

[Fast Zeta Transform] in [Sum over Subsets] is 2 and [Approximate Version of Fast Zeta Transform O(N log(log(N))) - noshi91's note https://noshi91.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/12/27/121649] is 1
