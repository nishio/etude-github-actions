Three-day weekend!

memo
　Put real photos on the Pasta Logic page.
　D: Make a system that spits out the contents of txt2prompt in JSON and processes only the additional images.
　　Last time I assumed a human eye would see each line of the text file, but
　 JSON would make it easier to reuse for E and C
　E: Instagram Posting Support
　　Try to see if you can make a post with a bot.
　　If I can, I'll do something like one post an hour.
	C: Thompson sampling
	A: Ability to move to "not good" collectively
	　I'll throw out the obvious failures before my wife's review.
	　display none with delete feedback
	B: Write destination switching function
　　Make it easy to initiate a review with my wife.
　　Press the Start button to make a separate folder from the next save.
　　I pressed "month, day, hour," okay?


　Reproducibility by Seed
　　The recorded seed and the prompt give a totally different picture.
　　Try with prompt and seed immediately after creation
　　What is different and what is not different?
