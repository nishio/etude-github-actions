 *1430059628* I'm beginning to think that continuing to write on Facebook is a loss.
 The reason I'm not updating my blog as often is that I get more useful feedback on Facebook, so I tend to write there.
 
 When I write on Facebook all the time in this way, it has come to occur to me that "Hey, I think I wrote about the birth of cognitive psychology on Facebook the other day, but where was it? In the past, I usually wrote about such things on my blog, so I could easily find them by going to Google and searching for "Yasukazu Nishio cognitive psychology" or something like that. However, this is not the case with what I write on Facebook.
 
 And it takes a lot of time to unearth them, or they can't be unearthed and give up. Isn't this a tremendous loss? Isn't it necessary to crawl and store them at hand so that they can be retrieved?
 
 And the crawl is not easy either. There is an export function, but it doesn't export the sentences that I wrote in replies. Hmmm, how to escape from Facebook lock-in.... I've blogged about it anyway.

 It is much easier than this blog to post images and to add posts in replies.

 Note feedback received on this article in the order in which he noticed it, including what paths he took.
 
 - Facebook comment: IFTTT exporting to evernote and Google Drive
 - Facebook comments: I write for both Blogger and Facebook.
 - Facebook Messages: searchable through activity logs
 - Twitter Mention with Hattebu Linkage: If you just want to search, why not use Evernote Linkage?
 - Twitter EgoSearch: You can search by setting the language setting to English.
 - Hatena Bookmark Comments: You can search past articles by typing Posts about ~ by my friends, Posts about ~ by me, etc. in the search window.
 - Hatena bookmark comment: Vaguely published material is not meant to be readable over a long period of time (so I guess the argument is that we should spend the man-hours to make it properly for stock, instead of writing all over the place in the flow. You certainly have a point.)
 
 ** Summary
 
 The story about being able to search with the English UI doesn't seem to be available yet, at least in my environment, as it says "This search isn't available yet". In the meantime, I will link to Evernote so that what I write in the future will be stocked, and I will search for past articles in the Activity Log.
 
 ** Postscript
 
 I exported the Wall using Facebook's archive feature, and a search from there revealed that the desired article was dated December 30, 2014. However, the exported list of updates to the Wall does not include replies to that update. I would like to get the content of the reply, but the link to that article from the archive does not exist, so I cannot get to it. Searching the activity log for the keywords contained in the article does not yield any hits. It happened to be an article at the end of the year, so I opened 2014 in the Activity Log and found it right away.
 
 I found this: <a href='http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-backup-archive-all-your-facebook-data/'>How To Backup & Archive All Your Facebook Data</a> PS: This extension did not work in my environment.

 <body>Well, I think you could blog about it and then set up or plug in a setting or plug in to automatically post it to FB</body>.

 <body>I understand that. <br>Because Facebook is not indexed, the only way to go back in time is to go back in time, so while it can be used as a commercial, I think it would be better to write the text on a blog or website. </body>
