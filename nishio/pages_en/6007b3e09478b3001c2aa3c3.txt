People who are easily called old people.
A "People who easily call people old are much older, and those who are caught up in ageism, which judges people by their age, are much more stereotyped."
B: "Isn't the assumption that you're obsessed with ageism also stereotypical?"
C: "By this logic, wouldn't A be judged old by A's logic?"

It's a little more complicated in structure, and the cycle is built on the "people who say 'X' say X" part, but there's also a cycle where that statement of yours is a counterexample to the "people who say X say Y" that you use in the justification part of "people who say X say X".
