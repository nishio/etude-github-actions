Improved Tool selection
		I'm doing the "setState after reading Tool#activate in Paper.js" and it's a bug where I forgot to setState.
	 To begin with, "Tool#activate is called by setStateâ†’useEffect" is correct.
	 I don't remember where it was written, but the idea is "[single source of truth]".
	 React should have been the single source and the Paper.js side should have been subordinate and updated when editing there.
