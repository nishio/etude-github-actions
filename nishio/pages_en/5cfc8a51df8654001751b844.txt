Overly complicated system
 A [system] that is too [complex] cannot be designed [in advance] in the brain
 Human cognitive abilities cannot [verify] if the design on paper is [consistent
 So we need to create a verifiable computer implementation first.
 Gradually become more complex, do
 Naturally, it will be unmaintainable beyond human cognitive capacity.
 DNA of living organisms is also unmaintainable.
 Good as long as you can adapt to the environment

 Other things being equal, of course, the higher the maintenance, the better.
 However, in situations where it is unclear "whether the system can be realized" and "whether the realized system will bring value," verification of the system is the top priority.
 It is not a good choice if the verification is far from easy to maintain.
