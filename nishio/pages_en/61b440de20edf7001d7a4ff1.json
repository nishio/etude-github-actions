Scrapbox-like recall effect on Kozaneba
I want to separate them because adding more and more kozane to one place in Kozaneba is getting heavier and heavier.
I want to help you find [RELEVANCE] across this parted place.
Notifications based solely on the occurrence of common words will result in garbage notifications all over the place.
Scrapbox makes explicit bracketing with a single step, and then connects those "single steps" to each other with exact matches and suggestions for connecting them with ambiguous searches.
In the context of [the "Experiential Process and the Creation of Meaning" Study Group 1], this "one-step" is a statement that "refers to some [perceived meaning] in one or more of the words, and that it is not a 'literal' one ([parallel symbol]), but one for which a page can be created." This is a [non-parallel symbol].
Similar "one-step-at-a-time" items are, in Kozaneba, "expanded stickies" and "groups with edited titles."
Wouldn't it be nice if we could connect this across places?
