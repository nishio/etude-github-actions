 Technologists tend to assume that mechanical artifacts are tools. That is too narrow a definition. Language and other abstract concepts are also tools. p.21

 (In the past) science was a branch of philosophy and its purpose was the perfection of knowledge. To use it was, as Plato famously claimed, an abuse of science and the downfall of science. Technology, on the other hand, was focused on utilization. The goal was to improve human capabilities. P.46

 The technological revolution began somewhere in the 50 years between Isaac Newton and Benjamin Franklin

 (1720) In the era of the South Seabubble case, patents were attacked as monopolies. In 1769, when Watt obtained his patent, it was recognized as a means of promoting technological progress. p. 47

 First mining college established in 1776. One reason was the growing need for technical training of field foremen due to the increased use of steam engines. p. 49

 The lesson should not be forgotten. What was then called medicine had already become a respected entity, only medicine did not undergo such a transformation in the 18th century. P.50

The explosion in demand for low-cost labor made slave breeding the most profitable industry p.57

 Competition can no longer be local; all companies must go global; there can be no local presence in the age of e-commerce. Where to sell and how to sell may be important now, but in 20 years, they will be meaningless. p.61

 No one in 1520 predicted the eventual emergence of the secular book; no one in 1820 predicted the advent of the telegraph, photography, or sanitation.

 *1273292108* A Study on Why Train Programming is More Productive
 Reprinted from Twitter
 
 - Coding done on the train is more productive because it is coding that you want to do of your own free will.
 - Productivity is high on the train because it doesn't get interrupted.
 - The approaching deadline is clear, so the deadline effect occurs and productivity is high.
 - Because you can't do research on the train, tasks that require research are put off, and as a result, you appear to be more productive because you perform tasks that have already been pre-researched or can be done with the knowledge in your brain.
 - Since there are transfer interrupts whose timing can be predicted, outputting to a file so that I don't forget what I was thinking about during the transfer, and walking around helps me to organize the problem.
 - The moderate noise of the train and the stimulation of the hippocampus by the movement of the train may somehow enhance concentration.
 - "I have 15 minutes to get to my destination, so can I get that thing implemented in that time?" This is exactly the kind of "spontaneously set time limit challenge" that gets the dopamine flowing. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4569696791?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& <a href="" target="_blank">"CreativeASIN=4569696791">Study Methods for the Brain</a>" says it's good for the brain to do that.
 - Simply because of the habit of train coding OR reading on trains up to now, the imprinting of "on trains = strong immersion" is taking place.
 - Changing the perspective a bit, and considering why we were able to achieve high productivity at Java-ja Onsen, which is the same noisy place but has some interesting stories that are difficult to immerse oneself in, the reason may be that we dropped our progress on Twitter so that we could see what we were working on. In other words, I was anticipating a high frequency of interrupts, and perhaps it was a good thing that I adopted the strategy of "recording my thoughts in external memory at a fine granularity so that I would not lose track of what I was thinking and to what extent even when interrupts occurred.
 - Tasks that have already been broken down into smaller units to the extent that you can start working on them on the train, so they are highly productive.
 - The presence of constraints allows for a breakdown of tasks according to requirements and what can and cannot be done at the moment. A task "to implement a certain function" can be broken down into "to find out how to use bit.ly's API.
 - It is not a task that involves waiting time such as deploying because it is done on a train. Conversely, if I do a task that requires a long compile time, am I less productive?
 - I'm committing to the repository at hand in small functional units as part of the risk avoidance of forgetting what I was thinking about in the transfer interrupts. Does that give you a greater sense of accomplishment and push you back?
 - I'm on a train, so the context switch doesn't happen because all the threads in my brain, such as the company bulletin board, Twitter, Lingr, IRC, Skype, etc., are SLEEPING.
 - There's nowhere to run, so we have no choice but to focus.
