(4.2.3) Suffering of speed reading
Suppose a person who already escaped from "[quiet speaking]" challenges for the speed-reading and feels suffering. It commonly happens. Why does it happen?

If the bottleneck is the speed of understanding, the amount of understanding per unit time does not increase even if the information input amount per unit time increased.

Fig: [Even if the amount of information input increased, the amount of understanding does not increase]

	Vertical axis: the amount of information
	Dotted line: the amount you can understand in unit time
	White bars: the amount of input of information
	Grey bars: the amount of understanding of information


On the left side of the figure, the amount you can understand per unit time and the amount of the input per unit time are the same.

Suppose you wanted to understand more and doubled the input speed. It is on the right side of the figure. The amount of the input has doubled. However, the amount of information which you understand has not changed. As a result, you understand only half of the input. You may feel suffering that "I do my best for the speed-, but I do not understand at all."

I also felt suffering from this situation. From where does this suffering come? This suffering comes from inconsistency between your self-image and reality. First of all, there is a false self-image that you can understand all even if you read at double speed. If you actually read documents at double speed, your understanding goes half. This inconvenient reality and incorrect self-image cause inconsistency. This inconsistency creates stress and suffering.
