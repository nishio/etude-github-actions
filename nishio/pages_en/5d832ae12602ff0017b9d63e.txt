Asking for a definition when the definition is ambiguous doesn't work.
If Mr. A uses the word X and you are not sure of the [definition],
Often, Mr. A himself does not understand "what X is."

What is X?" If a person cannot answer the question, "What is X?" If you ask the question, "What is X?
The correct answer is "I don't know" or "I can't answer that",
Especially when asked immediately after Mr. A uses X, Mr. A often replies, "You don't even know that?
This is because Mr. A unconsciously avoids admitting that he used words he did not understand.

	[definition ambiguous].
	[I'm afraid to say, "I don't know."]
	[You don't know that?]
