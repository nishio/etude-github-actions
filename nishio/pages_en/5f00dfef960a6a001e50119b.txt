I know.
Knowing" is better than "[I don't know]". However, for knowledge that can be easily acquired through searches, there is not much difference because those who realize that they "don't know" can easily change their status to "know. Those who "think they know" and believe in false knowledge are worse off than those who "[don't know]" because they do not have the opportunity to search for and obtain correct knowledge.
