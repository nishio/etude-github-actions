Period of rapid economic growth in the still
In a situation where the country's economy was growing, things were turning fast, as investments were made with the expectation that if you put out money, it would come back bigger and better in the future. It is more profitable to give money out first. On the other hand, when the economy stagnates, that expectation is lost, so people try to force others to delay putting out money. What I noticed today is that this phenomenon happens not only to countries, but also to companies and individuals, and there are still companies and individuals in Japan who are still in the high economic growth period.
