Comparison of [Logistic Regression] and [Naive Bayes

in short
	If there is enough data, logistic regression is advantageous.
 Naive Bayes is advantageous for timing with little data
However, since it is unclear "how much data would be needed to reverse the situation for this issue" for an individual problem, "try both" is probably the correct answer from a practical standpoint.
