Natural language implementation
Writing papers and books is [implementation] in natural language, and writing programs is implementation in [programming language]. The situation is that the appropriate format of [knowledge representation] differs depending on the [architecture] of the human brain and the [CPU] of the computer.
However, just as [GPUs] of different architectures have been created on the computer side, and programming for "systems in which computing devices of different mechanisms are combined," programming for "systems constructed by humans and computers should be done by nature.
In the development of groupware, it is necessary to design and implement the system as a whole, including humans, rather than focusing only on the software implementation for the CPU.

The term "[social implementation]" is used, but there is a more detailed layer between computers and society.
