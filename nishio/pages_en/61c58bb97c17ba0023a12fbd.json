Keichobot makes language and Kozaneba makes it one-dimensional

When your head is [jumbled].
	When it's a network of "that and this are related, right?" and it doesn't become a smooth [one-dimensional] [story].
	First, you have to get that "[relationship]" out of your brain and into a "[inextinguishable] state.
	Then, by looking at it as an object, you can treat it "at a distance ([dissociate])" and "from a [bird's] eye view".
	When you are just thinking in your brain, your thoughts and yourself are merged into a unified whole, so it is beneficial to separate them from the subject by making them into an object ([objectification]) outside. ([Separation of subject and object])

in other words
	[Keichobot] encourages us to make words ([symbols]) out of [moyamoya] that have not yet been put into words.
		Clarify the "relationship" by asking questions about the relationship between its symbols.
		If there are a lot of "relationships," it becomes "[a] mess.
	[Kozaneba] helps objectify the relationship and make it a one-dimensional story

[The KJ method was a method of objectifying "relationships" that had not yet been verbalized by taking them out of the brain in the form of "Let's put it near here because it seems to be related to something.
	Bundling with a [nameplate]" was a process of looking at "things that [seemed to be] related" after the fact and putting "relationship" into words.
	In the words of "[the process of experience and the creation of meaning]," this means that the collection of [RELEVANCE] encouraged the verbalization of [felt sense] (i.e., an unverbalized feeling that something is related).
	Kozaneba can now make the existence of a relationship explicit by "[drawing a line]" regardless of proximity.
		Therefore, it is now possible to "structure the existing structure while making use of it," which was not possible with the KJ method.
