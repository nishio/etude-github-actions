Virtual Nishio Laboratory_Introduction
The Virtual Nishio Laboratory is a virtual laboratory created as a social experiment for Nishio to see if it would be a good idea to create a cross-organizational "laboratory".

The mental model of a laboratory is generally that it exists as a subset "within" a "specific university". However, if we cut out the parts that are necessarily tightly coupled to a specific university, such as the awarding of degrees and the use of lecture rooms, we should be able to create a cross-organizational type that is not tied to a specific organization, and we believe such a place would be beneficial to our members.

	Eligibility for Admission
		As the lab metaphor goes, it's not "for everyone."
  Ultimately, this is at Nishio's sole discretion, but here are the general criteria
  	A: Tokyo Tech MOT, Graduate School of Economics, The University of Tokyo, and other equivalent students and graduates
   B: Unrepeated adopters and graduates
   C: Other people who Nishio thought would benefit from the discussion.
		We do not think it is a good idea to have too many people, so the more people we have, the stricter the screening criteria will be.

	The system is a Facebook private group + Scrapbox private group.
	Participants will be asked to agree to the [Nishio Lab_Non-Disclosure Agreement
 The word "laboratory" seems to conjure up different images in different people's minds, so I will explain:
 	[Various Labs]
  [University is not a place to teach.]
	We believe the number of people should be limited to a maximum of 30. There is more than one group as the number of people exceeds 30.
 	[Management consisting of several groups].
