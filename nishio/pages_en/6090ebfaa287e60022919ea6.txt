 Appropriate notes
 - Make the community atmosphere favorable by picking out only users who behave favorably in advance and making them beta testers.
 - Become irreplaceable.
 - Adventure is scary. If you keep one foot on the conservative core and the other foot on a new landing spot, you can always go back even if you don't find it. It is much safer than jumping out of nowhere.
 - Geeks cannot be subdued by age or by being a big name. The only way is to solve the problem that he/she is struggling with in a quick and easy way right in front of him/her.
 - "It's programming in kernel land, isn't it, management?""That analogy doesn't get through to the general public at all."(audience laughed loudly)
 - "It was passing the test all along, but as soon as we did a new test and found a bug, the test wouldn't pass!"
 -- I guess a variant of this: <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%89%B9%E7%95%B0%E3%81%AA%E3%83%90%E3%82%B0'>Specific bug - Wikipedia</a>
 - If you write code, deliver it, and that's it, you don't get a sense of ownership of the code. If you release the code as open source, you get a sense that you own it, which leads to increased motivation.
 - It is much better to have technical exchanges with engineers from other companies in the same industry than to try to hide the know-how only within your own company.
 - I heard that "What are you coding?" can be used freely. I wonder if someone could make a T-shirt with "CodeRepos" written on it and "What are you coding?" written on the balloon in a round Twitter-like design. I tried to make one, but when I downloaded and started GIMP on my Mac, it crashed immediately.
 - It is one thing to use programming as a method of expression, it is another to have programming as a job.
 - It's a simulation, so it's interesting even if it's buggy. It's like a chemistry experiment.
 - It is important to move ahead as much as possible.
 - Programming is a method of expression, it should not be censored.
 - It's cold, the chair is hard, and my hips are aching.
 - I like the presentation tool, I think it's called Rabbit, looks good for LT.
 - However, when I think about it calmly, it is not a good tool if the viewer's (my) consciousness is taken in that direction.

 - Batteries are no more.
 - Kwalify: JSON and YAML schema validators, etc.
 - PositLog SaasBoard
 -- The picture is handwritten and inputted.
 - GeekLib.net
 - RetroTube
 - Libraries with technical books: due dates help prevent stacking
 - I thought you were talking about building a library, but you're talking about building a search engine.
 - I think there could be a real demand for a geek library or something like that.
 
 (Battery is dead.)
 
 get-together
 I heard that Mr. Yoshioka has rounded up to three-digit age. Congratulations!
 
 *1220618845*Mita Line
 
 I get lost because I can't find the entrance to the Mita Line. Following the arrows, I came to a dead end at the ticket gate of a station that is clearly not on the Toei Mita Line, such as Tokyu Meguro Line. I tried to enter the station by chance, but there was only Tokyu Meguro line. When I looked at the train, I found that it was a direct connection to the Toei Mita Line. It was hard to understand.
