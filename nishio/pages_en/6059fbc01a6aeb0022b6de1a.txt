Timing of ✅value question is early → excessive extraction of movement
from [pKeicho]
Is the timing of the value question appropriate?
　https://keicho.netlify.app/#talk=alUKPkDIxF4BN18b4Yoe
	Isn't it too early to ask the value question?
	Observation of what was happening
	Improved the script I created when observing [keyword appearance rate] to be able to specify a single log to [observe keyword score variation] during an interaction `see_score.py`.
	Observation: Higher scores for "do
	Re-learn [Motion Extraction
	 Past work [notes on work to extract movement].
　[✅Allow specifying the logs to be trained for motion extraction].
　 [downsampling too tight]
　This will improve on this case, but we'll see what happens in general.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I thought it might be a good idea to mention the 3As in the explanation of the good use of this chat system, so I want to sort this out before I write the manuscript.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "chat system" is that "chat system"?
[nishio.icon] A system that asks questions in response to user statements. He explained that it helps users to organize their thoughts by answering questions.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "user" is that "user"?
[nishio.icon]human, basically alone. And the beauty of this system is that even one person can "organize thoughts through dialogue.
[nisbot.icon]What "system" is that "system"?
[nishio.icon]It could be called a system that acts as a dialogue partner in place of a human being. So, 3A is a technique to enhance the dialogue between humans.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "dialogue" is that "dialogue"?
[nishio.icon]This one is human-to-human. The 3A stands for "answer, add, ask," which means that you should not just answer the question, but add information and ask further questions about it.

code::
 prev: 100:answer, 90:ask, 83:add, 75:add information and more it, 57:abbreviation, 53:add information and more, 38:human to human, 30:question, 26:3A, 24:do, 17:information
 
 total: 400:dialog, 176:system, 120:human, 106:do, 105:human to human, 100:user, 100:chat system, 100:answer, 99:mention, 99:techniques for boosting dialog, 99:to boost dialog, 99:3A, 90:. ask, 86:question, 85:thinking, 84:to enliven, 83:add, 82:technique, 81:statement, 80:is, 75:adding information to, 75:organizing, 62:asking questions, 62:opponent, 57:abbreviation, 55:manuscript, 53:adding information to, 48:for statements System for asking questions, 44:System for asking questions.

[nisbot.icon]What do you value?

I see, this means that the verbs are now extracted by [Motion Extraction], and "do" is also extracted, and I thought it was okay because the score was low on its own, but since it appears at high frequency, the score is accumulated and it is recognized as "a developed and important word".

These two.
	82:Do
	24: do

This is not good either.
	80: Yes.

Just tell them that this is not good enough because it's done by machine learning.
