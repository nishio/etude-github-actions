A series of pictures of two people saying different things
2021-10-29
I was trying to make a [tote bag], and I was arranging the pictures I drew in this Scrapbox, such as [blind spot cards], in Kozaneba, and I realized that there are several pictures in which the characters are looking at the same thing and saying different things.

	[Changing the word magnifies the misunderstanding].
	[The usefulness of defining the boundaries of a concept].
	[both "is X" and "is not X" are compatible].

There were a few things that could be redrawn to fit it.
	[Same? Different? is a false dichotomy]
	[Going in reverse, but the goal is the same]
	[different things belonging to the same thing].

After I finished making the tote bag.
　[false dichotomy] painted a similar picture.
 [I thought, "One-dimensional diagrams are easier to communicate, and if I add people to them, they will be easier to understand." So I drew a new picture.
 　Here, he realized that "these pictures are 'a series of pictures in which two people say different things,'" and he made them into a series after the fact.

　[value varies according to parameters].
　[whether or not it is acceptable to approximate].
　[Deteriorated copies spread.]
　[spread or not spread]
　Since I recognized that these are 'a series of pictures in which two people say different things,' I feel like I can find more diverse patterns than ever before.
	[I know both, but the other person only knows one].
	[People looking for rough edges of new things].
	[both think the other is an idiot]
	[There is a minority that affects more than one person and the majority disagrees.]

　[If there is a difference in cognitive ability, then there is a discrepancy in observed facts.]
　I just noticed that [6 and 9] and [a cylinder looks like a circle or a square, but it is neither a circle nor a square] are also in the group.
