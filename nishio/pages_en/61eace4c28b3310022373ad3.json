Why>How>What or Why>What>How?
[Why>How>What] or [Why>What>How
	In [Simon Sinek's] [Golden Circle] [Why>How>What].
		>hrjn: This how is the strategic element, thinking about how to reach a goal or create a social impact, which defines the what deliverable.
	[Why>What>How] has not been found so far, except in a Japanese book called "[All about product management]".
　　In this composition, "How" becomes "After deciding what to make (what), how to make it".
　Note that these two How's are completely different.

>[gabu https://twitter.com/gabu/status/1484190168022089731]: the ideal product manager is someone who leaves the how to the designers and engineers. Hence, we don't need a spec sheet? We don't need a spec sheet or screen design document, so if you can verbalize the Why and What in a way that is easy to understand, we will do the best job we can! Please, leave the How to us! Please!

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484343969421348867]: I've always been uncomfortable with the how of engineers, but I recently realized that I had confused the concept of how with the two meanings of business and how to make it.
>[Simon Sinek] is explaining the how of business and he talks about Why>How>What, but the Eng community talks about Why>What>How.

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484344707614638083]: The how of a business is a strategic element, thinking about how to reach a goal or create a social impact, which defines the deliverable what What is the how of a business?
>The Eng community's "how" is from the perspective of how to create the deliverables, and in this frame of reference, the "what" is too restrictive and Eng becomes a manufacturing machine.

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484345413599903745]: With the Eng framework, the screens and functions are decided at the What point, so all that's really left is how to make it and the architecture.
>I don't mind that it's worth it, but my personal opinion is that in a time when the cost of making things is going down so much, the specs are going to shit!

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484346148890767361]: so actually, I feel like Eng should be embedded in the business frame, and we can think why>how>what together. PdM should focus more on "why" and concentrate on business impact, while Eng is responsible for "what" = all deliverables. Eng is responsible for all the what deliverables, and the how strategy is developed based on mutual understanding. This is ideal.

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484346342315270145]: I don't think Eng or PdM can get here with the level of publicity, though.

>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484479645915308033]: I don't really understand it properly, but where does the Why>What>How come from in the PdM / Eng world?
>I actually don't know the original source.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484480802335322119]: I think it's Japanese English (straight face)

>[gabu https://twitter.com/gabu/status/1484360288321171464]: In product management, Why > What > How, so the order is certainly different from Dr. Simon's [Golden Circle].

	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484481360098066437]: sorry for the abruptness. I'm looking for the original source of this framework, where is this picture from?

>[shunsukeaihara https://twitter.com/shunsukeaihara/status/1484493972982857729]: I think the difference is that engineers' how is the last because it is concrete and consultants' how is the middle because it is a framework. I think it's a difference in the way we use our brains. I don't know about the origin, but I think it's natural that "how" comes last.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484498658586693638]: I know what an engineer's "how" is, but I'm not sure what this "what" is?
	>I'm starting to feel that the diagram is not quite right when I look at it intently. The business strategy and competitive analysis are in different places, the user experience and the paintings are disparate, and there is a great sense of blurriness.

	>[shunsukeaihara https://twitter.com/shunsukeaihara/status/1484498868163481602]: this diagram doesn't make sense
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484498922970423296]: how can you stand a strategy without analyzing the competition? I can only wonder if you're going to look at pane without doing a journey or something like that.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484500508501241857]: I was looking for the original source, but I couldn't find anything like it, so I am wondering what this is.
	>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1484501282438389764]: I guess mankind is still doing product management properly.

>[gabu https://twitter.com/gabu/status/1484503270513328134]: It's a diagram from the book "[All About Product Management]", which is probably itself the author's own framework.
