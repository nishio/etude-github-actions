 	>Once you know your strengths and how you work, you can find opportunities. It is an opportunity to use your strengths, work style, and values. At the same time, it is an opportunity to make a contribution.
  >However, in order to do so, one must know what contribution to make. Thinking about the contribution one should make is the starting point for moving from the knowledge stage to the action stage. What is the contribution to be made? In other words, what difference can we make? Answering this question will help us to know what opportunities to seize. When such opportunities actually appear, they can be seized.
  >What should be considered is what is required, what will be contributed, and what results will be achieved.
 ã€€>This is how the best careers are made. It is not obtained through planning or luck. It is obtained by seizing opportunities that match your strengths, work style, and values.
