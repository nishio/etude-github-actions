Age of Racing, Age of Games
I read something about it a long time ago and remembered only the key words "[age of racing], [age of games]" and had not been able to find the source for a long time.
I vaguely remember finding a book on [Lanchester Strategy] on my father's bookshelf, so I probably read it on my own when I was in middle school.

>In his writings in the 1980s, Mr. Nobuo Taoka, the founder of Lanchester Sales Strategy, mentioned that the era of "race-type competition" had already ended and the era of "game-type competition" had arrived.
> 
> "Racing competition" refers to competition in growing markets such as those seen during the [high-growth] period.
> There, the order is determined as first, second, and third place.
> The competition is to get a share of the prize money, like this: first prize: 10,000 yen, second prize: 5,000 yen, third prize: 3,000 yen, and so on.
> 
> In contrast, "game-type competition" does not determine rankings, but rather winners and losers.
> Winners: 100,000 yen, losers: 0 yen, and so on.
> If you don't win, you don't get a share.
> 
> In other words, "race-type competition" is where "[hard work] always pays off," and "game-type competition" is where "[hard work] does not always pay off.
