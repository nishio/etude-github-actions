And [/scrapbox-drinkup] is over 100 pages.

It appears that even if you specify more than 1,000 items in "limit", only 1,000 items will be taken.

â†’[Link Title Suggest].

What we want to know
	What is the percentage of pages with no links?
	How many links per page?
		And how is it disjointed? (Maybe [should distribution])
	How many appear per link? How are they varied?
	Percentage of 1-word links
	Percentage of links consisting only of nouns
	Percentage of links consisting only of adjectives and nouns
	Those containing verbs
		[actively bracketing the verb].
	Anything containing a particle
