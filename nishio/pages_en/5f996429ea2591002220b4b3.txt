 Thoughts.
  The problem of matching 10 parts with minimum cost by choosing some from a set of 1000 parts.
  2^1000 is too big, but 1000 x 2^10 is about 10^6, so there is plenty of room
  DP with the 2^10 subset as the definition domain and the minimum cost to achieve it as the value domain.
 ã€€Initialize the empty set with 0 and others with INF and chmin for each set

               dst = s | src
               table[dst] = min(table[dst], table[src] + CS[i])
       ret = table[2 ** N - 1]
       if ret == INF:
           return -1
       return ret
