non-degree student
For working people who want to "study at graduate school," I would like to introduce the Credited Auditors system, which is surprisingly little known.

>The Credited Auditors System is a system that allows students to earn regular university credits in order to meet the demands of a diverse range of learners, including working adults.

Many people have the image of "0% or 100%" and think "quit my job and go to graduate school," but that's a tough hurdle, isn't it? If you take one 90-minute class per week, can't you adjust while keeping your current job?

cost
 Examination fee 9,800 yen
 Entrance fee 28,200 yen
 Tuition fee 14,800 yen per credit

You need to specify the lecture when you apply. Information about the lectures can be found on these websites

Also, as a preliminary step to becoming a credited student, it might be a good idea to read the reference books specified in the syllabus.
