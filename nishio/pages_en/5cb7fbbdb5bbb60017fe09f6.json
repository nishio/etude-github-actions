status quo analysis tree
[Current Reality Tree]

[problem-solving compendium] that I read and interpreted.
	Write down in the center of three columns what is wrong (problem surface)
	Write down to the right what that problem aspect brings (results)
	Write down the causes and conditions that bring about the problem aspect (causes)
 Use arrows to represent the relationship between the items written out.
 	Add items as needed.
 	If multiple arrows are AND conditions, specify them.
 	Trying to be "logical" and thereby reducing omissions
	Often the same thing appears in multiple parts of the tree
		Like cause and effect are the same thing.
		→[vicious circle loop] can be noticed to have occurred
	Current Situation Analysis Tree and [Future Analysis Tree].
		Starting with the current "bad things" is the [current] analysis tree
		Future Analysis Tree (Future Reality Tree) is to start from the "good" ([ideal]) of the future.

It is consistent with the basic concept of [Goldratt] that taking a part of an interdependent system and optimizing it will not result in total optimization, but that we must grasp the whole, find out what needs to be improved, and make those improvements.
On the other hand, [Dr. Goldratt's Logical Thinking Process] says "find constraints." Please check it.
	→I mentioned "finding constraints" earlier, but also "finding vicious cycles" on p. 103


One interesting point is that you start with more than one problem surface.
When problems are intertwined, picking one problem at random and coming up with a solution will not work.


I had mistakenly thought the markings on the arrows were AND/OR, but apparently not.
	Cause insufficiency
		Multiple causes, any one of which can be "insufficient" to bring about a result if any one of them is missing.
		In other words, this is an AND.
		The translation reads "[sufficient cause]," not "[sufficient condition]," but "[necessary condition]."
			I think you have made a mistake in what should be "inadequate cause."
	[additive cause]? [additional cause]? (additional cause)
		>There are two special situations. The first is called another cause, and another cause itself can consist of more than one cause (sufficient cause).
			Chances are good that the person doing the translation didn't properly understand this part.
		>The second situation is quite different. This is the idea of "amplification" and intensification, where another independent cause intensifies the result.

				I'm using the word "additive" here.
				Independent (OR) conditions can be expressed by arrows without any symbols in the first place, so I think the bow-tie type symbols are deliberately introduced to express "mutually amplifying" and "additive" relationships.
	Goldratt's Theory of Constraints: A Systems Approach to Continuous Improvement divides it into three categories
		Ellipse: Conceptual "AND": complete dependency
		No Symbol: Additional Cause: complete independence
		Bow Tie: Magnitudinal "AND"
