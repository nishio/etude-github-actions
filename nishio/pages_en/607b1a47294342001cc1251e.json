	[https://gyazo.com/11d10ff87e903baa96b7c276ede6e35c]
There was some talk about how they came up with the idea, so I'm going to write an explanation.
	Let N be the number of digits in a.
	[$ \frac{10a+b}{10^Nc+a} =\frac{b}{c}] なので分母を払って [$ (10a+b)c=(10^Nc+a)b] である
	Sorting for a, [$ bc(10^N-1)+a(b-10c) = 0]
		For simplicity, we write [$ d+ae = 0].
	Divide by a prime p large enough so that the equality holds even if the remainder is taken as an arbitrary number.
		[$ d+ae\equiv 0 \pmod{P}]
	この時、aは [$ a \equiv -de^{-1} \pmod{P}]
	[$ e^{-1} \equiv e^{P-2} \pmod{P}] in [Fermat's Little Theorem].
　Therefore, if [$ b,c,N ] is determined, [$ a] is determined
　Check that it is obtained correctly (most of the time N does not match the length of a obtained).
　If we have more than one P, we can also use [Chinese remainder theorem] to find a large a

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1383431158592012311]: if b,c are prime to each other, then we know that a is a multiple of bc like this, the rest is the last equation, but since a and bc are not prime, what happens to the inverse element And...

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1383466772611796995]: Well, [Chinese Remainder Theorem](CRT)! I thought of that, and after I sorted out the equation for a, I took two prime numbers about 10^9 large enough to make a CRT, but as it turns out, there were solutions smaller than 10^9, so it's not really a CRT, but a place where if you bring in a large enough prime number, you can find the inverse by [Fermat's Little Theorem].

>5050505050505050_5 / 50_5050505050505050 = 1/10

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1383468653354520582]: you have 297 except for the 10x ones with a range of 1 digit for b and max 2 digits for c. It took 0.2 seconds for this enumeration.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1383470519895216128]: oh, I forgot to mention that I set the number of digits in a to 2-17. As you can see from the output, if you don't limit the number of digits, there are innumerable.
