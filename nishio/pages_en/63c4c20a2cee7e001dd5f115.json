However, the [natural language] used by homo sapiens, who are not good at logical thinking, is ambiguous in interpretation, so they speak in [artificial language] that can be strictly interpreted.

As time has progressed, our understanding of the natural language used by Homo sapiens has advanced, so that even Homo sapiens with poor logical thinking skills can converse with AI.
