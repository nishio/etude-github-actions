Finding the next element in a set
Given a value a, I want to find the smallest x such that a < x from the set

The set is represented by a phenic tree with a value range of 0/1.
	`sum(a)`: [$ \sum_{0 \le i < a} X_i]
	`bisect(s)`: minimum x s.t. sum(x) >= s
at this time
code:python
 def find_next(self, pos):
     s = self.sum(pos + 1) + 1
     return self.bisect(s) - 1
