Re: tightness of category
from [/unnamedcamp/category cramped].
 [/unnamedcamp/rashita.icon]I expect that if you "fit in" with those who see from the outside, it will be difficult to develop a free discussion from the inside.
 	People looking from outside = public nature -> library-like classification needed
	I feel that we need two places, a "closed" (does not mean closed) place to expand the discussion and a place to prepare it for delivery to the public, and if we "directly connect" them, both probably won't work. [/unnamedcamp/rashita.icon].
		What is the "closed" attribute of a place that is "[closed, not closed]"? [/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon].
