 3: I want to use a cover image

			It doesn't have to be this big...
   I can't jump to the key book page, so I end up writing a link.
	4: Create a book page

  The image appears in the Links below, but not here.
  That would be fine in many cases.
  You could also put your reading notes for the book on that page.

  At any rate, if you put in the Amazon Associates bar.
  	$("#amzn-ss-text-shortlink-textarea").value
   "http://amzn.to/2skOmD9"
  	$("#imgBlkFront").src

   It seems to be possible to link with an image if the image URL is placed in the order of the URL to be linked to.
