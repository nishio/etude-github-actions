Trying to make those who don't understand understand create suffering.
[Buddha's] thoughts in [Sanyutta Nikaya 6.1.1

Suppose Mr. A explains something to Mr. B and Mr. B fails to understand it.
　What Mr. A wants Mr. B to understand
　　This is [greed].
　　It is the desire [for others to behave the way you want them to behave].
　　This greed creates [suffering] for Mr. A.
　　So Mr. A should avoid it.

[desire to be understood]
