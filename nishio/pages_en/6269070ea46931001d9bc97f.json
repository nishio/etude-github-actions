Both experienced and verbalization are needed.
Even if you only have a verbalized manual, you can't understand it without experience.
　It is not possible to create a document that covers all possible cases that may arise
　What appears to be rule-like is only better in principle, and in some situations it is necessary to break the rules.
　Not knowing when to ignore the manual if you have not experienced it yourself.
　　The defensive stage in the defensive-break-away cycle.

Experienced people alone don't work.
　Experience is only "knowledge of how things have worked out in the past".
　Is there a cause-and-effect relationship between the behavior and the outcome?
　It's possible that the current situation deviates from the "past situation."
　Blind faith in one's own past experiences is tricky.
　　Insist on old-fashioned things as if they were natural.
　Self-critical types are preferred.
　　This type says, "My experience is X, but is that really enough?" and become anxious.
　　It would be nice to have a chat for consultation.
　　For example, in Unexplored Junior, there is a "consultation" channel in the mentor-only group, where you can ask for help if you have trouble making a decision.
　　　For example, "I'm about to commission a friend to do an illustration for a web service I'm trying to create, is it possible to buy an iPad and send it to the friend at this time?" or "Is it possible to buy an iPad and send it to my friend?
　　　Decisions are not made by consensus or vote, but only by the mentor after gathering opinions and advice.
　　　It is preferable to have such a forum for consultation among mentors
　　It is difficult to implement this type of consultation across projects because it requires human beings to move synchronously.
　　So the next best thing is to verbalize and share various decisions.
