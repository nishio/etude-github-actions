Conversation Log 20210121
What to talk about in the internal study group and the demo. Since there are two topics at the beginning, one of them was delved into.
I had imagined a one-way connection from the chat system to Regroup, but when asked how Regroup would affect the chat system, I realized I had made a one-way assumption.
In the past, I had imagined integrating the chat system and Regroup and using them at the same time, but thought it would be inconvenient. This time, having verbalized the image of using the chat system with a smartphone, I noticed a new implementation pattern: "I call the chat system from Regroup, take it with me, go for a walk, and when I return, the conversation is added to the map. This one seems useful.

This log is the longest one on record. It might have been better to change the topic in the middle and start it separately. I added "New Talk" to the menu, which was not there at that time. You can start a new conversation in a separate tab.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I'm hoping to get organized for what I'm going to talk about at tomorrow's in-house study session. Also, I'm talking on my phone while taking this walk, so it's also a demonstration of how to use it.
[nisbot.icon]What type of demo is that?
[nishio.icon]If I, the person who is most familiar with it, don't show them how to use it in a useful way, it is difficult for someone who is not familiar with it to understand how to use it just by reading the manual.
[nisbot.icon]What type of usage is that?
[nishio.icon]It's not enough to just explain how to operate it; it's also important to know when you're using it, for what purpose, and in what situation.
[nisbot.icon]What type of situation is that situation?
[nishio.icon]Or "taking a walk" now and then.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I'm hoping to get organized on what I'm going to talk about at tomorrow's internal study session. Also, I'm talking on my phone while taking this walk, so it's also a demonstration of how to use it.
 Is there anything else you would like to share about this demonstration?
This is not just a demonstration of the [nishio.icon] chat system. Well, I couldn't show the chat system either, because it has existed as a closed chat bot until now. The important part of this time is the connection between chat and Regroup
[nisbot.icon]Where is that demo?
[nishio.icon]Chat with them, export it, put it in the Regroup, and organize it.
[nisbot.icon]What type of Regroup is that?
[nishio.icon]A tool to promote mental organization by arranging fragments of information in two dimensions.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of fragments are those?
[nishio.icon]In this case, chat statements are a bit too granular to organize after the fact, so it's better to chop them up into smaller pieces and then organize them.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that fragment?
[nishio.icon]Not too small, too small for common keyword extraction, and what we're going to talk about in this study session includes support for division into those stickies.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]So far, I have felt that the chat system by itself is effective and effective for Regroup, but I think that combining the two will create a better effect.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that Regroup?
[nishio.icon]It was not effective until a certain number of fragments were collected. It was difficult for people who were not used to creating such fragments. So, we decided to support the collection of fragments by having the text spit out in the form of chat and then automatically dividing it into stickies.
[nisbot.icon]
 > So far, I have felt that the chat system by itself is effective and effective for the Regroup, but I think that combining the two will create a better effect.
 Where is this Regroup located?
[nishio.icon] It has existed independently until now, but this time the direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
[nisbot.icon]Where is that Regroup located?
[nishio.icon]NG
[nisbot.icon]
 > It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
 What does this Regroup look like?
[nishio.icon]Consultants who first elicit enough information from the other party and then organize it on a whiteboard.
[nisbot.icon]
 > It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
 Where does this Regroup come from?
[nishio.icon]From where...I can use my phone to chat while walking or whatever, but I need a big screen to organize, and that's hard to do while walking. It's like chatting while walking and letting it dissipate, and then when you get home, you can calm down and start organizing.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of chat is that?
[nishio.icon]Moving the human perspective by asking questions
[nisbot.icon]
 > It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
 How do you know this Regroup?
[nishio.icon]Well, that's because I am the author. If I want many people to know about it, it still needs to be easy to understand how to use.
[nisbot.icon]
 > It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
 What should happen with this Regroup?
I hope people who use [nishio.icon] find it useful.
[nisbot.icon] What needs to happen to the Regroup for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]Is it necessary to communicate the flow of usage in such a way that it is useful?
Can [nisbot.icon]Regroup do that?
It was quite difficult to do it with [nishio.icon]Regroup by itself, so we connected it with chat this time.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that chat?
[nishio.icon]That's right. In the process of making the web version, we had to turn off various functions, and there were things we wanted to improve but left out because the code was too complicated.
[nisbot.icon]
 > It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
 What is the relationship between this Regroup and the chat?
[nishio.icon]It's a heavy tool to start, so I feel like I'm getting traction with a tool that's easy to start: chat.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that chat?
[nishio.icon]It's primarily intended for smartphones.
[nisbot.icon]
 > It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
 Is this Regroup the same as chat? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]No, sir.
[nisbot.icon]
 > It existed independently until now, but the new direction is positioned as "use the chat system first, and then Regroup".
 What happens in the chat when this Regroup?
[nishio.icon]Ah, what changes in the chat would there be on the Regroup side of factors? I hadn't thought about that. At least the logs I'm outputting now were hard to use with Regroup as is, so I plan to tweak them a bit; Regroup is a heavy tool, so I don't want to make it mandatory to use Regroup, chat has to be able to provide value with chat alone.
[nisbot.icon] What happens to the Regroup during that chat?
[nishio.icon]Oh, yes, there was some talk about wanting to organize the results of multiple chats together, or having a Regroup next to you in real time when you chat. It would be nice to call up a chat from Regroup, talk while walking around, and when you return, a sticky of the conversation will be added to the map. Integration not real-time.
[nisbot.icon]What is between that Regroup and the chat?
There is a [nishio.icon]sticky note division support algorithm. That is one of the key points of this project. Chat messages often contain useless words if they are resized appropriately as stickies. Therefore, it is necessary to chop them into appropriate sizes and remove the useless words. This is what we did this time.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that chat located?
I'd like to see [nishio.icon] dig deeper into the sticky note division support algorithm. Maybe we can chat separately...
[nisbot.icon]What is that chat like?
[nishio.icon]In short, this chat system tries to delve into one topic, so when a user finishes a conversation and tries to delve into another, he/she does not understand it and sticks to the previous topic. Well, there may be unexpected connections between what the user thinks are different topics. Chat is like a person who listens and is like a hook that catches what is in the water.
[nisbot.icon]Where does that chat come from?
[nishio.icon]If you mean how users will discover this chat, a few people have expressed interest on Facebook now, so I think I should introduce it as a beta test. If the number of users increases too rapidly, my capacity will be overflowed.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its a chat?
[nishio.icon]Oh, you're talking about how we came to know this one. Where it comes from is originally a method called symbolic modeling, which was done by humans and was expensive, so they reduced the functionality and made it electronic.
[nisbot.icon]
 > If you mean how users will discover this chat, a few people have expressed interest on Facebook now, so I think I should introduce it as a beta test. If the number of users increases too rapidly, my capacity will be overflowed.
 What do you hope will happen in this chat?
[nishio.icon]It's not ready now, but after the learning data collection mechanism is in place, it can learn and become smarter if users use it a lot.
[nisbot.icon] What needs to happen in the chat for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]One of the features that is temporarily turned off right now is the storage of training data, which needs to be restarted.
Can [nisbot.icon] chat do that?
[nishio.icon]Well, I'll do it.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that me and Regroup?
[nishio.icon]Author.

 What is the relationship between this Regroup and the sticky note?
[nishio.icon]Stickies are units of information movement on Regroup
[nisbot.icon]Is that Regroup the same as a sticky? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]Different. Components
[nisbot.icon]
 > Sticky note is a unit of information movement on Regroup
 What happens to the stickies during this Regroup?
[nishio.icon]RegroupI used to use paper stickies, but it was inconvenient, so I went electronic. One good thing about going electronic is that I can make a big sticky with two clicks, and I can duplicate and back it up.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of sticky note is that?
[nishio.icon] electronic, a square area with a short text
[nisbot.icon]
 > RegroupI used to do this with paper stickies, but it was inconvenient, so I went electronic. One nice thing about going electronic is that I can make a big sticky with 2 clicks, and I can duplicate and back it up.
 What happens to the Regroup at the time of this sticky?
[nishio.icon]Making stickies bigger is good to make it clear at a glance that they are important.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that sticky?
[nishio.icon]I would like to talk about an algorithm to create these stickies from chat statements.
[nisbot.icon]What is the relationship between that chat and the sticky?
When you reply to a [nishio.icon]chat like this, the text is engraved and becomes a sticky note.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that sticky?
In [nishio.icon]Regroup.
[nisbot.icon]What is between that Regroup and the sticky?
[nishio.icon]That's quite a philosophical question... hmmm, I don't know.
[nisbot.icon]
 > When you reply to a chat like this, the text is inscribed and becomes a sticky note.
 Is this chat the same as a sticky note? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]Chat is too long a sentence, so chop it up.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the stickies during that chat?
[nishio.icon] generated more and more
[nisbot.icon]
 > When you reply to a chat like this, the text is inscribed and becomes a sticky note.
 What happens in the chat when this sticky?
[nishio.icon]Stickies are currently seen by users after the chat is over, so there is no influence from stickies to the chat. Well, of course, there is the idea of displaying them beside the chat, but this chat system is effective in that it draws people's attention by asking questions, so displaying them in such a way that they are distracted will actually reduce the effectiveness of the system.
[nisbot.icon]What is between that chat and the sticky?
[nishio.icon] Algorithm for morphological analysis of chat sentences and iteratively splitting them if they are too long.

 Where are these stickies located?
[nishio.icon]They show up after the chat is over.
What is the relationship between [nisbot.icon] that chat and the chat system?
[nishio.icon]Same

 What do these stickies look like?
I answered [nishio.icon]the same, but the individual chat and the system for it are different? Even if the stickies appear after the individual chat is over, the chat system can still understand the contents of the stickies and utilize them when conducting the next individual chat.
[nisbot.icon]Where do those stickies come from?
[nishio.icon]So what those stickies look like are fragmented memories of past dialogues. They come from past dialogues. If there is a statement in the current dialogue that matches the past sticky, the chat system can make associations by following the "proximity relationship" created by moving the sticky on the Regroup. The current chat system can display a quotation and ask a question like, "You said this in the previous dialogue, is this ~ and this ~ the same thing?" You can ask questions like.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its a sticky?
[nishio.icon]Yes, this is important. Stickies from the past are often forgotten, but the chat system reminds us.
[nisbot.icon]What should happen to that sticky?
[nishio.icon]I hope it will be a catalyst for unexpected inspiration.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the sticky for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]It's important to see it again in time.
Can [nisbot.icon]stickies do that?
[nishio.icon]We can't do paper stickies, we can't do current Regroup, we can present past stickies here if interacting with this chat system is a daily interface with humans. There may be times when this is beneficial to the user and times when it is not. No one has experienced it yet, so I can't judge if it's good or bad.
Is [nisbot.icon] its chat system the same as chat? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]Yes, this is actually something different, which is an important realization this time. Individual chats are done for individual purposes, and in the version before this port, each new start lost past memories. It was still beneficial, but with this modification, especially the fact that the logs are now stored permanently in case they are shown to others, it is now possible to have a permanent memory. So, now that each user has a persistent memory, they'll gradually figure out my vocabulary and stuff and pull up what I've said in the past.
What happens in the chat system when [nisbot.icon] that chat?
A new memory will be added to the [nishio.icon] chat system. I'm thinking we could include past blog posts, tweets, and writings, not just chats.
What happens in the chat when [nisbot.icon] that chat system?
[nishio.icon]Individual chats will help you remember the past.
What is [nisbot.icon]between that chat and the chat system?
[nishio.icon]There is an exchange of memories.
[nisbot.icon]
 > New memories will be added to the chat system. I'm thinking we could include past blog posts, tweets, and writings, not just chats.
 What is the relationship between this chat system and stickies?
Not all words that appear in [nishio.icon]chat are valuable, so some are discarded when they are made into stickies and organized, while others are made into large stickies.
Is [nisbot.icon] that sticky the same as the chat system? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]This is indeed something else.
[nisbot.icon]
 > New memories will be added to the chat system. I'm thinking we could include past blog posts, tweets, and writings, not just chats.
 What happens to the stickies during this chat system?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, on the sticky side? Can't think of that right now.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the chat system when its stickied?
The [nishio.icon] chat system can learn what pieces of past conversations the user thought were important or relevant concepts.
What kind of chat system is [nisbot.icon] that?
[nishio.icon]I've diverged a lot, so I'll end this.

 What is the connection between this chat system and stickies?
