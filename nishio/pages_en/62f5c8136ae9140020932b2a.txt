I don't find it funny." and "I don't find it funny."
For a given X, if there are two persons, A who says "[interesting]" and B who says "[not interesting]", then
　False for "X is not interesting as an objective fact.
　 As a counterexample, Mr. A is amused.
　It can be interpreted as, "Mr. B can't [find the fun in] X."
　　You don't have to find everything interesting.
　　The information that "Mr. B doesn't find it interesting" is "unimportant" to Mr. A.
　　　Just ignore Mr. B and get together with other people who find X interesting.
　　　　[like-minded people].

I think the higher [the skill of finding fun], the higher [the fun of life].
