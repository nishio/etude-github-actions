Human Inertia
	In physics, there are phenomena in which a moving object keeps moving in the same direction or a stationary object keeps stopping.
 This is called the law of inertia.
 Humans have such inertial movements and non-inertial movements that start moving in new directions that are not so inertial.
 Organizations are strengthening [inertia].
  Suppose there are three people who have a 60% chance of choosing "[status quo]" and a 40% chance of choosing "[change]".
  Individually, 40% of the time, we choose to change.
  If these three people take a majority vote...
  	All maintain status quo: 22
   2 maintain status quo: 42%.
   2 people transformed: 29%.
   All transformed: 6%.
  and the probability that the status quo will be chosen increases.
  [Majority rule] reinforces the majority option.
   It would be interesting to visualize how the increase in the number of people biases the majority #Experiment needed
   On the other hand, a majority for "change" would strengthen it.
    Call it "company culture," but dominant design in decision-making.
    Example: "If an improvement fails, do not undo it, but improve it further." Toyota Production Capability: The Ultimate Wisdom of Monozukuri.
  This calculation was a choice between "maintain the status quo or change," but in the form of a proposal and discussion, it could happen that the change proposal differs in a case where "more than one person chose change," making it even more likely that "[maintain the status quo]" will be chosen.
   We can alleviate that a bit by making the choice "first, maintain the status quo or change."

 It is inevitable that [inertia] will become stronger in an organization that has been maintained for many years.
