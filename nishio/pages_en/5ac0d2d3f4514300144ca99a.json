>By the way, this is the GAMEDOJO project entrance assignment. This is to be solved once a week and repeated 3 times.

 >This enrollment assignment will transform the fluffy freshmen into a group with clear intentions.
 >In just three weeks, we will be a group that pursues every avenue, every possibility, to carry out our objectives.
 >It would be much better for the company to stop training new recruits and camps to make slaves and make them do this entrance assignment for three weeks.
 >Only, those who have received this training will mercilessly take down their idiot bosses and retrain them, or if impossible, eliminate them.
 >When I entered GAMEDOJO, Master Shibamura told me, "When you join a company, start a war. Defeat your stupid bosses and old, old men." So.
