Parable of the Plants
from [/arpla/interesting diary(haruhi)].
[** plant metaphor]
	[Evergreen Notes] compares a notebook that grows into a lush evergreen tree, and says that by taking care of it, we can enrich our knowledge.
	Scrapbox also allows topics to grow as they wish through bullet points and communication in the form of a tree diagram, and new pages can be created as if cutting out a single branch or flower.
	On another note, the expression "trees and forests" also fits well.
		In Scrapbox, trees called pages are connected to each other to create a forest-like environment.
		To follow the link is to walk across the trees and explore the forest as [an information gibbon].
		You can look closely at each individual tree or at the forest as a whole.
	[Donald Norman] divided cognition into experiential and introspective cognition.
		However, Scrapbox, which defends a simple display, seems to have a philosophy that places relatively heavy emphasis on the former.
		One might say that when one scrolls down and sees the related page list column, one switches into an introspective cognitive mode.
		Obsidian Canvas and other features that visualize the relationship between pages were very popular in the PKM community just prior to ChatGPT.
		However, I would like to see a more overarching system of information in Scrapbox as well.
		[Kozaneba] and [Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector] by [/arpla/nishio.icon] may play a role
