 *1344943173*epubを作る
 I unzipped the sample epub, rewrote it and zipped it, but it didn't work. I checked the specs carefully, and it says that mimetype files should not be compressed. Oh well.
 So I zipped it with the following command and got an epub that can be viewed on Kobo.
 
 >||
 $ zip -r -n mimetype foo.epub mimetype OEBPS META-INF
 ||<
 
 By the way, to explain, -n <suffix> is an option that says "do not compress files with names ending in that suffix," -r is an option that recursively traverses the directory, foo.epub is the filename of the zip, and "mimetype OEBPS META-INF" is I explicitly specified the order of compression targets because mimetype needs to be placed first.
