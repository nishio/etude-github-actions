I want to give a link when no hash is specified.
This didn't work (it also comes up when a hash is specified).
code:jsx
       <HashRouter>
         <Route path="/:id" component={Child} />
 
         {/* <Route exact path="/">
           <ul>
             <li>
               <a href="/#manual">Manual</a>
             </li>
             <li>
               <a href="/#key=sandbox">Sandbox</a>
             </li>
           </ul>
         </Route> */}
 
       </HashRouter>
[HashRouter]
