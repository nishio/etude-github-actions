ABC195
ABC195 It was 4 questions, I got 2 RE on D, couldn't figure out why so I skipped it and solved E, went back, couldn't figure it out, looked at F.
I've looked at the official commentary and it's as good as the official commentary up to F as far as considerations are concerned, so it seems to be a phenomenon of not getting points due to lack of implementation skills.
ABC195D, I tested cases where N or M is 1, I tested 10000 random cases and did not reproduce RE at hand, when does it become RE?

I thought it would go down harder, but surprisingly it did okay.

B
	I'm nervous that I'm going to put in one wrong bug.
	code:py
	 def main():
      import math
      A, B, W = map(int, input().split())
      W *= 1000
      WB = math.ceil(W / B)
      WA = math.floor(W / A)
      if WA < WB:
          print("UNSATISFIABLE")
          return
      print(WB, WA)

C
ã€€Personally, I was nervous that B was going to put one wrong bug in, but this one was smooth.
ã€€If I had to put it into words, I'd say [vertical-to-vertical conversion].
ã€€Vertical length (10^15) is longer than horizontal (15), so add vertically instead of horizontally
	code:py
	 def main():
      N = int(input())
      d = 999
      ret = 0
      while N > d:
          ret += N - d
          d = d * 1000 + 999
  
      print(ret)
