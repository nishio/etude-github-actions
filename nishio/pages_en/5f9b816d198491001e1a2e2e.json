doubling
Given [$ f(x)], I want to find [$ f^n(x)] fast
　If the width of the definition and value range of f is D and the maximum value of n is N, we can pre-process O(D log N) and main process O(log N)
	pretreatment
		Since [$ f^{2k}(x) = f^k(f^k(x))], we obtain [$ f^{2k}] by O(D) when [$ f^k] is known
	　Since k=1 is known, we obtain in O(D log N) for k such that [$ k=2^m < N
	main processing
	　Just pick out the 1's in [binary expansion] of n from the preprocessing results and synthesize them.
	　The length of the binary expansion is of logarithmic order
