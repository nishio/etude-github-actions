>"I have my replacement" or "I don't have a replacement" in a project is not 0 and 1. This is about how much it costs to replace.
> 
> When the replacement cost exceeds what you can realistically pay for the project, you get the two words "irreplaceable person". It's not actually this simple, but from a momentary perspective it is.
