Information is more important than people
>Scrapbox was originally developed in a university laboratory where 1/3 of the workforce is replaced every year, so it is more [information-driven] than human. [We want to preserve knowledge.]

Certainly in this environment, the information "Mr. X, who graduated three years ago, wrote this text" isn't very useful.

On the other hand, in the context of [groupware], some people feel there is a big difference between "a text written by the president" and "a text written by a new employee"
	Whether this is preferable or not.
		I'd prefer to be clear for command and control, but there are a lot of situations where that's not the case.
		When everyone is trying to think with wisdom, the [authority gradient] based on position gets in the way.
			There was a story that "students who are accustomed to [Dr. Masui] will start to use a tamale to Dr. Masui."
		Is this concern the main reason why Scrapbox is taking the route of not explicitly indicating authorship?
		A text is not "shared material" if it is "owned" by an individual author.
			It is difficult to create a flow of improvement for others.
