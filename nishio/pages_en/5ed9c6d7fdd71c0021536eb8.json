What you thought was one concept is two nested concepts

　We were talking about a concept, calling it A.
　But it doesn't come across well.
　After digging into why, I discovered that there are two concepts called A
　　Hereinafter referred to as A1 and A2.
　These two are in [inclusion relation] in [event space
　　in other words
　　　A1 then A2
　　　A2 but not necessarily A1
　If you do not pay attention to this "A2 but not A1" event, or if it is very rare, A1 and A2 appear to be the same thing
　　As a result, one word, A, calls them both
　　This is a state where the boundary of the concept of A is blurred as shown in the lower left figure.
　　Humans can manipulate symbols without realizing that the boundaries are blurred concepts.
　　　Often overlooked unless one is trained to clarify boundaries.

　　This is a lot about organization.
　In [the relationship question], you're asking about that relationship for two concepts, but there are cases where the two concepts are [identical] in the first place.
