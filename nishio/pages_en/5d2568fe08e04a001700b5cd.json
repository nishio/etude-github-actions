iPad may ignore focus
	BUG: When adding a sticky, the focus is on the text area on the PC version, but not on the iPad for some reason.
		I'm doing textarea.focus() in useEffect.

 Well, if focus is not heard except when called directly from within an event handler, then there is nothing we can do in this case, where the state is updated in the event handler and React sees the state update and removes the display:none.
	Touchstart on buttons to display & focus directly instead of letting React do it
