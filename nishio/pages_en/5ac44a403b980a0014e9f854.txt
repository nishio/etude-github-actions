 Mr. A has a lot of knowledge.
 Mr. B's total knowledge is not comparable to that of Mr. A.
  However, because the areas of knowledge are different, Mr. B can give his knowledge to Mr. A.
  In return, Mr. A can give you knowledge in his area of expertise.

 	However, Mr. C has an area of knowledge overlap with Mr. A.
  So I cannot exchange knowledge with Mr. A.
