 They immediately shrank by half.
 â†’ Hello World in Grass - * *scrap* http://d.hatena.ne.jp/youz/20080606/1212769842
 
 I see, Grass requires a number of characters proportional to the depth of the stack to touch a value deep from the top of the stack, but if you create a function I that returns the argument as is, you can stack the deep function at the top of the stack. The technique is that if you have to touch a deep function twice, it is shorter to call I once and stack it back on top of the stack. However, I was blind to the fact that wv makes I.
 
 Also, I'm not...

 +2 = \x -> Succ(Succ(x))
 +4 = \x -> +2(+2(x))
 ...

 So I created a function to change the value significantly, but first I had the idea of creating a function dbl that applied the given function twice.

 dbl = \x -> (\y -> x(x(y)))
 +2 = dbl(Succ)

 I have a feeling that it would take a surprisingly deep insight into how to make the shortest number of moves to create a given number... I almost thought about it a bit when I tried to create a code generator for Brainf*ck...
