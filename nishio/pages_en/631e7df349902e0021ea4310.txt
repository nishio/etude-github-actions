I don't think it's limited to "the lab," but maybe "the first X a student belongs to."

What is this X?
　At first I was going to say "organization," but what's the difference between a club, a circle, or a part-time job?
　　Maybe it's different from those organizations in that, as noted in "Career Bias," "it is good to question the claims of an organization's leaders."
