Shotgun analogy
	Talk about all the content you want to communicate.
	The receiver has less prerequisite knowledge than the speaker, so the explanation that the speaker thinks "this explanation will get the message across" is often insufficient
	P1: Listeners are overwhelmed by a large amount of content that is not well explained
	Is this not good?
	The speaker is not an esper.
	P2: The speaker does not know what the listener has prior knowledge of
	It is impossible to "tell a story that will be understood by the listener" because what is conveyed depends on the prior knowledge one has.
 The strategy of "spread out a lot, and if you get a few hits, you're OK" is also possible, depending on the situation.

	To resolve P1, it is possible to check if they are following along, as appropriate
		However, the phenomenon [of being afraid to say "I don't know"] prevents listeners from sharing "I don't know" information.

			This is another case of raising and lowering the hand to match the surroundings.
	To solve P2, communication with the listener in advance could be considered
		If there are only a few listeners, yes, but not in a case where there are 100 listeners.

	There is also the problem of mismatches that occur when people come to a lecture thinking that they have to understand 100% of what is being said.
