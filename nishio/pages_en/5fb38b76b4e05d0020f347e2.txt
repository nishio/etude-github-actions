Move from the smallest to the largest
Techniques for speeding up merging of multiple sets

	When merging something of size X into something of size Y, it is assumed to hang O(X).
		code:python
		 for x in X:
		     Y.add(x)
	Repeat the merging of the elements of a set of size N into a set of size 1 with only the elements of each
		In a naive way, O(N) merges N-1 times, so O(N^2)

 If we decide to merge the smaller one into the larger one, this becomes O(NlogN)
 　Discussion:.
 　　Let X be the smaller one.
 　　Each time you merge, the size of the set will be 2X or larger.
 　　If we look at an element x, it is at most [$ \log_2 N] times the smaller of the two.
