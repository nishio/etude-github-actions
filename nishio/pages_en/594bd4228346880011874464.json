One month interval is good for long-term memory.

The relationship between the interval between the first and second study and test scores six months after the second study under the condition of only one review.
 Black marker in the figure
  The highest when the interval between the first and the second is one month.

	It depends on the question whether the higher grade is achieved by reviewing in a week or in 6 months.
 	Six months is higher for more difficult problems.
  Either way, one month is the peak, and the spacing OR one day is lower than the other is the same.
 As test delays become multi-day, the optimal ratio approaches 0.1
 Past studies have strongly suggested that a 1-day gap is optimal, but those experiments had a TEST DELAY of 10 days or less
  1 month is optimal for a 6 month TEST DELAY

The old title was [Effects of Interval Iteration Method], but the title didn't give a clear idea of what was in it, so it was changed.
