Behavior toward unfamiliar words
>hmori: Technicians use [jargon], but when they hear jargon they don't know, they always [ask for clarification]. That's not harassment. Please don't be offended.
 It seems that there are A's who ask for explanations for technical terms they don't know and B's who get angry when asked for explanations.
 When A uses his terminology, he assumes that B will ask questions if he doesn't understand it, and if there are no questions, he interprets that he understands.
 B uses a word he doesn't understand, interprets it to mean "don't ask for details," doesn't ask questions, and uses it himself.
