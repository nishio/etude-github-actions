InfoSphere
	A spherical space created by placing objects around it from a certain viewpoint
 I thought it would be more convenient to give it a name, so I decided to call it the Infosphere.
	At the center of the infosphere is the core.
 Core becomes [teleport target].
 Information in the infosphere is tied to its core.
 If the core is moved, the information comes with it.
 If the core also serves as a teleport target,
  Single click to teleport, long press to drag mode
		The reverse is teleporting if your hand stops while dragging.

	The distance when the information slide is first placed in front of you is 20, so the radius is 40 in x2
 Default interval between infospheres should be 100
