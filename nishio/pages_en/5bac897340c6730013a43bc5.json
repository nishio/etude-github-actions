>My theory is that [money has a color]. [Intellectual production] goods have a high [profit margin] and are the color of money. ï¼ˆIf the total value of [intellectual production] exports is 100, the profit reaches 40 to 50. Conversely, for manufacturing hardware exported from Japan, if the total amount is 100, the profit is 3 to 5. The color of money is light.
