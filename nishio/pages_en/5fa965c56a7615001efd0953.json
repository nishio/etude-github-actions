Grundy数
	負け状態のGrundy数は0
 The Grundy number of a state is the smallest non-negative integer other than the Grundy number of states from which it is possible to transition
		mex: minimum excluded value

　The number of stones in a pile in [Nim] matches the Grundy number

　Why is it OK to XOR?
　　Let gi be the Grundy number for each mountain
　　Let g be the one joined by xor
　	[$ g = \bigoplus_i g_i]
　Since we can prove that this g satisfies the Grundy number condition
　half finished proof
 　　Let m be the most significant bit of g. There are always an odd number of gi with m. Let g1 be one of them.
 　　[$ g_1 \& m = m]
 　　[$ g_1 \oplus g < g_1], so transition is possible
 		[$ \left( \bigoplus_i g_i [i \neq 1] \right) \oplus (g_1 \oplus g) = \left(g_1 \oplus \bigoplus_i g_i [i \neq 1] \right) \oplus g = \left( \bigoplus_i g_i \right) \oplus g = g \oplus g = 0 ]
