Four people talk about righteousness.
I think it would be easier to convey the feeling of [relativization] by making it sound like a lively conversation among four people with different ways of thinking, rather than making it a philosophical discussion about [the relativization of correctness].

Mr. M, Mr. S, Mr. C, and Mr. P. (More may be added in the future.)

Mr. M and Ms. S
	M "If you make a series of reliable inferences based on reliably correct information, you will only get reliably correct information."
	S "What, where did that 'reliably correct information' come from in the first place? (Chuckles)"

	S. "If it's confirmed by repeated experiments, it means it's right."
	M: "If you check 100 times, you might get a different result the 101st time. If you've checked all the patterns, it's a solid inference, but it's not right to make judgments about the whole by looking at only some of them."
	C. "I'm not sure there are many situations that can be repeated in the first place."
	P. "That's right."
