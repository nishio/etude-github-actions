numbness in the thighs
　I was concerned because it was a physical symptom that I had never experienced before, but I decided that it did not seem urgent, so it was not something that would require a trip to the hospital right now.
　Make a note of the symptoms so that you can remember them when you have a chance to describe them.
　Symptoms began in mid-November.
　　Sensation of cold blood running on surface of right thigh
　　It's like, "Maybe it's because it's getting colder."
　It got progressively worse and a sensation spread across the entire surface of my thighs similar to the loss of sensation in my cheeks after a dentist's anesthesia.
　I've done a lot of research on numbness in the thighs, but I can't find a good explanation.
　　What is meant by the word "numbness" is quite mixed.

　　　Location is close to this one.
　　　But "standing or walking with chest out" does not apply to this one.
　　　Most clearly when waking up and improves with walking.

 　　No pain has been reported.
 　　Walking has not been affected.
 　　>When you see your doctor, tell him or her how long you have had the symptoms, whether they have changed in severity, and whether you have any other symptoms such as pain.
 　　 so I'll write a note.
 　Symptoms always right thigh
 　100% incidence upon waking
　Looking back and thinking about it, there was a mental depression during this period, and the momentum itself was depressed.
　　With subsequent improvement in mental health, he began taking walks and his symptoms have weakened.

　2021/1/18 Today was the first day since the numbness started that I wasn't numb upon waking.
