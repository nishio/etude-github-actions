Mathematical Model Thinking

 I'll write an article when I feel like it, saying that it can be explained by a mathematical model.
 I think that if we use [mathematical models] to express [qualitative] stories that are "what is it?
 You can do a repeat experiment or [experiment] with different conditions.
 	Experiments under different [conditions] and [comparisons] help to deepen [understanding].
 Let's try this on several topics to create some examples of "mathematical model thinking" and then we can compare them to explain more about mathematical model thinking!
