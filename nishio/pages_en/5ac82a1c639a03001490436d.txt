Morning Time Use
 There are two opposing claims about the use of morning time.
 	The theory that "the brain is not occupied in the morning and should be used creatively; it is a waste of time to use it for chores."
 	The theory that "in the morning, you have to get your chores done first in order to start the engine."

  Brain memory is allocated when there is something to worry about ([zygalnic] effect).
 	Creative work is undecided on the results obtained for the time spent.
  	It doesn't always produce results.
  	If you work for a day and don't get results, you're exhausted and have no energy left to do chores.
   It is also unclear how long it will take to complete
  Getting chores done is only as good as the results you get and the sense of accomplishment you get from doing them.

   As is often said, "motivation comes after the fact when you start working" [work excitement].
 	Creative work is "heavy"
  	Takes time to start moving.
   Whoever said, "It's good to do creative work in the morning" wasn't being lazy in the morning.
  The worst thing you can do is say, "You should do creative work in the morning instead of chores," and then do nothing.
  Thinking about which task to start with is a creative process in itself.
  	So it's equally prone to sloppy procrastination.

	Conclusion.
 	You can do it from either side.
  The most important thing to avoid is to think, "I must do A first," which will cause B to be postponed.
