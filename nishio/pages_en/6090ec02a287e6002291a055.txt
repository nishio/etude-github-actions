 **1263729083*[Kaizen] Cleaning toilets
 I'm not talking about kaizen, but rather cleaning and tidying up.
 
 This time it's a bit dirty and about what to do with dried dirt on the part of the toilet above the surface of the water.
 
 I scrubbed it with a brush, but it didn't come off, so I thought, "Well, soaking dishes in hot water makes it easier to remove stains, so why not soak this in hot water, too?" I scooped up some leftover hot water after taking a bath and added it in a big splash.
 
 Unfortunately, the mechanism seems to be that if the water surface rises above a certain level, the water will flow away. I thought to myself, "No, it won't hold hot water," and as I kept pouring it in, it began to remove the dirt.
 
 Result: The dirt on the surface of the toilet bowl became sparkling clean simply by pouring in the leftover bath water.
 
 Issue: Dirt (urinary calculus?) under the surface of the water is not being removed by this. This is not taking off the dirt (urinary calculus?) under the surface of the water. It seems that if you spray 1 liter of SUNPOL, you can just leave it: <a href='http://oshiete.homes.jp/kotaeru.php3?q=154330'>Outline! HOME'S-kun about the chemical that removes urinary calculus</a>.
