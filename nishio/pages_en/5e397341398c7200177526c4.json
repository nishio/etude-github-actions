	[Scrapbox sticky] [external link sticky] to read more about it.
	When you are [displaying and organizing each page in Scrapbox as an item
		Read in detail -> scroll through Scrapbox to find the desired link -> tedious
	Should be able to jump directly from external link stickies
	　Slot a sticky note with additional information
	　`local_info.url`にした
	　I thought about making it `extra` because it's additional information, but I thought [it's better to distinguish values that are not stored on the server].
