Put it in a box or assume a model.

I'm saying that I think it's wrong to put them in the box of old people.

Nishio Hirokazu
If it's a comparison between collecting them and putting them in one box and then categorizing them, or categorizing them from the beginning, I think we should collect them first and then categorize them.

Jun Kuikei
I don't think I'm either of those things.
They think it's just a multiplication of some three or so factors.

Nishio Hirokazu
That's an interesting story.

Jun Kuikei
I think of it as multiplying x, y, and z, so that if age is in z, you are called an old man, and if a woman is in z, you are called a fucking femme fatale.
It's the previous parameters that matter.

Nishio Hirokazu
It is possible that the model is correct, but it is also possible that it is just a dogmatic assumption.
