Intellectual workers own the means of production.
[Drucker's [Drucker's] Conditions for Technologists, Chapter 5, p. 85.
>The intellectual worker owns the means of production. The knowledge they have stored in their heads [is] portable. Their [mobility] is high precisely because they [own] the means of production.
 In other words, the model "workers do not have the means of production, so they sell their labor to a company ([capitalist]) that has the [means of production] and get paid for it" does not hold true for intellectual workers.
 Now, the question is how to evaluate the value of that asset. This problem has been apparent in the hiring of programmers for quite some time now, and various methods have been proposed, such as having them write Fizzbuzz (it is surprising that people who can't even write Fizzbuzz apply for a job as a programmer) and breadth-first search problems. However, what is much more reliable than those tests, and a strong differentiating factor because there are not many people who do it, is the release of the source code of the home-made application.
 As was said in the [dramatic one-pager], you have to [output your own value]. You have to actually output what you are capable of outputting. Whether it is publishing source code, writing a blog, speaking at a conference, or writing an article for a magazine, it depends on each person, but you have to output something anyway.
