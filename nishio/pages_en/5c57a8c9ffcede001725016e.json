What is "shallowness?"
What is "[shallowness]"?
	What specific characteristics do you mean by the term "shallow" with respect to the project proposal?
	Unable to respond to [in-depth] questions.
	For "I'll use technology X," I ask, "What exactly is technology X?"
	For "I want to do Y," ask "Why do you want to do Y?"
		It would be "[shallow]" not to be able to answer such an obvious question.
