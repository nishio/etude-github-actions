Teaching Machines to Read Fast
	The input speed of machines is orders of magnitude faster than humans.
 So it never occurred to me that there is a need to teach [speed reading] to machines.
 But from a [rhetorical afterimage] perspective, there is an appropriate speed for comprehension, and reading too slowly can hinder comprehension.
 Machine reading is significantly faster than human reading, but "slow reading" that follows every word
 Maybe we should have a faster reading.
 In other words, we should teach machines to read faster.

	Read the Table of Contents
 	E-books with a table of contents as structured data are easy
  If not, the tree structure of the table of contents must be ascertained from the text data of the paper
 	The tree structure created is the output
 Keyword Search
 	Can be done with existing keyword extraction programs
  What is it about "a quick look and it jumps out at you?"
  	One line of text is entered and keywords are extracted from it.
   Repeatedly appearing keywords increase cognitive efficiency through priming and jump to the eye.
 Create a question
 	This is pretty advanced, I don't know how to make it.
  What is <keyphrase X>?"
  "What is the relationship between <keyphrase X> and <keyphrase Y>?"
 Create a mind map
 	Output [associative network] in tree structure

[What would you write in a book if a machine could freely write in Scrapbox?]
	Table of Contents of the book
 Keywords for the book
 The questions I had after reading the book and their answers
 A tree-like associative network about the book's content
