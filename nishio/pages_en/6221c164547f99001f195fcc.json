Evergreen note (evergreen note)
	Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time.
	This is an unusual way of thinking about writing notes.
	Because most people only take [temporary notes].
	Because these practices are not about writing notes, but about developing insights effectively.
	[Good note-taking misses the point; what matters is good thinking].
	Making better notes is not important; it is "better thinking" that is important.
	Hopefully, these notes will be of great value.
	Evergreen note writing is the basic unit of knowledge work.
	It is difficult to write notes that are worth taking the time to develop. This principle helps.
  [evergreen note should be atomic].
  [evergreen notes should be conceptually oriented]
  [evergreen notes must be closely linked].
  [Prefer associative ontology over hierarchical taxonomy].
  [writes notes for himself by default and ignores the reader].
 This concept evolved from Niklas Luhmann's "Zetterkasten," which he positions as an independent intellectual partner in the writing of his 70 books.
