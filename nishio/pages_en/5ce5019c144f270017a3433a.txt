conversational tone
		>Regarding the language: Seeing that you are familiar with the work of Staffan Nöteberg and David Allen, I would create a conversational tone similar to theirs. I’ve been reading popular non-fiction books (Dave Asprey, David Allen, Ryan Holiday, etc.) and their tone facilitates easy reading. This is what I will emulate in order to attract the same target market. If you want, I could edit a section, using Track Changes, for you to see how I would change the text.
	>I want to work on the tone. Your tone is very formal, whereas the tone in current publications is much more conversational. I'm thinking here of writers whose tone and style I really like, such as Steven Pinker, Daniel Pink, Cal Newport, Laura Vanderkam. So please let me know if you want me to work on the tone and style.
