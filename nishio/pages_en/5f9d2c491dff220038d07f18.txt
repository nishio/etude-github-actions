　Thoughts.
　　The problem of making a string into two substring repetitions
　　I don't know where the second starting point is.
　　There's two ways to read it, depending on which one you skip when you're in a discordant situation.
　　hmm
　　Theoretically, the second starting point could be from the second letter, but then the cost is N-2 at best, right?
　　Consider the second trio of starting points n, points of interest i, j
　　Start from (n, 0, n) and reach (n, n, N) to reach the goal
　　If Si=Sj, we can increment i,j at zero cost.
　　　If not, you can increment one at cost 1.
　　In other words, this is a [shortest path problem], which can be solved using the [Dijkstra method]. The graph is not constructed explicitly.
　　Since N is 100, the number of vertices is about 5 x 10^5. There is plenty of room.
