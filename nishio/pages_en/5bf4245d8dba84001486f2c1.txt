p.99 Basic rules for making mind maps (up to the second level is a heading in the book)
	(1) Emphasize the image
		Always place [center image] in the center.
  	Trying to paint a picture makes you aware of blind spots.
   	This rule of mind mapping is what inspired me to conduct the experiment of "drawing a picture of creativity" on p. 193 of [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers]. The abstract word "productivity," which I thought I "understood," was forcibly concretized into something "visible" by drawing a picture. After I became acutely aware of this benefit, I was curious to see how other people would draw the same word, so I experimented.
  Use a lot of images (pictures) throughout.
  The central image should be painted using at least three colors or more.
  Draw as multidimensional as possible.
  Make it sympathetic so that everyone can understand.
  	This is difficult to understand, but the intent is to appeal to all five senses.
  Vary the thickness and length of the branches, the size of the text, and the size of the image.
  Make the mind map as neat and beautiful as possible.
  Create an appropriate space between each branch.
	(2) [Associations] will flourish.
  Use arrows
  	Connecting likely relationships with arrows, irrespective of branching.
  Use colors to create a colorful finish.
  Use the sign.
  	Draw common marks on related branches to indicate association
	(3) Finish in an easy-to-understand manner.
  Only one word/image is painted on each branch.
  	>A mind map is a series of branches that grows and evolves. However, if you write long sentences or multiple words on each branch, your mind map will quickly become a jumbled mess that is difficult to understand.
			>Make it a habit to write only one word or image per branch. This, in turn, highlights the connection between one branch and the next, and the [associations] will spread from one to the next.
  Write letters neatly in block style, without scribbling.
  Keywords should be written just above the branches.
  The length of the branch and the word should be roughly the same.
  Always tie adjacent branches tightly together.
  Branches of major keywords should be drawn with thick emphasis.
  	>In the early days of mind mapping, it is easy to write more important words on the secondary branches that follow the BOI (main branch). In such cases, paint that branch thicker or surround that word or image with colorful lines to emphasize the impression.
  Group the network of major branches by drawing a line around them.
  Draw the mind map as clearly and clearly as possible.
  Use the paper horizontally and do not change the orientation.
  Write letters as straight across as possible.
	(4) Pursue your own unique mind map.
