I think there's a bit of a difference between "problem-solving options" and "life options."

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon] Talking about how to acquire [options] "[problem-solving options]" and "[life options]" are related, but I think they are a little different, so I want to dig into the difference.
[nisbot.icon]What "problem-solving options" are those?
[nishio.icon] There is a problem that has already been explicitly identified. The solution options for that problem. If you don't know, you can solve it inefficiently or not solve it.
[nisbot.icon]What "options" are those "options"?
[nishio.icon]For example, when it comes to math problems, there is a solution method that you learned in school. However, there is an implicit restriction that they must be solved with paper and pencil in the examination hall. In the real world, when that restriction is removed for problem solving, you can let a computer do the calculations, or you can chat with someone who can solve the problem.

 > There is already an explicitly identified problem. The solution options for that problem. If you don't know it, you can solve it inefficiently or not solve it.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "option"?
[nishio.icon]The more options we have, the better we can solve problems.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "choice"?
[nishio.icon]Head
[nisbot.icon]
 > The more choices we have, the better we can solve problems.
 How do you know what these "options" are?
[nishio.icon]That is an important question. Learn what options are available? This "learning about the options" is itself a problem-solving process, and you can ask people who might know, or you can use a computer to search
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "choice"?
[nishio.icon]I want to put that aside and talk about "life choices".
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]There is value in deepening my understanding by thinking about the differences and the like, and the deeper my understanding, the better I can explain it.
[nisbot.icon]
 > I'd like to put that aside and talk about "life choices."
 What would you like to see happen regarding this "option"?
[nishio.icon]Hopefully knowing your options will help you make better life choices.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "choices" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]We need to know our options. What do we need to know our options? Learn about the options, use a computer (search?), or ask someone who might know? or ask someone who might know?
[nisbot.icon] With regard to "choices," can it?
[nishio.icon]There's no such thing as a textbook to learn from, and search can work, well, sometimes it works, but it's a matter of gathering information and being more specific about the options you're aware of, and it can be hard to notice the "options you're not aware of". The ask-people style has the chicken-and-egg problem of how to find someone who can answer it first.
[nisbot.icon]Where does that "choice" come from?
[nishio.icon]That's a really important question, and I think knowing this will have a big impact on my future life. Why do you think so? Because the choices are shifting from a homogeneous, large supply to a small, diverse supply.
[nisbot.icon]What does that "choice" look like?
Like [nishio.icon]products? If there was only one type of mass-produced product, it was whether you could afford it or not, but when the products are diverse, it becomes which one to choose. But I think it's a little different.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Need to know the alternatives. What do we need to know our options? Learn about the options, use a computer (search?) or ask someone who might know?
 What "know your options" is this "know your options"?
[nishio.icon]There used to be a word "role model. However, as society changes rapidly, a 20-year-old cannot use a 40-year-old's way of life as a reference because the surrounding environment is too different. In order to use a role model as a reference, it is necessary to abstract and extract a timeless model, but this is a difficult task for human beings because we all live only once.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "person" is that "person"?
[nishio.icon]People who will have to live in the future in a situation where it is doubtful that they will be able to live well even if they refer to their role models and their parents' way of life because they are told that the pace of change has increased and uncertainty has increased.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else about that "person"?
[nishio.icon]At the very least, you're in trouble if you don't understand that situation and have options other than "do as your parents do."
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "parents" are those "parents"?
[nishio.icon]Let's say you're 45 years old, the first iPhone appeared when you were over 30, and people said at the time, "How can something like this without an input button be popular?
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "do" is that "do"?
[nishio.icon]ðŸ‘Ž.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "something without an input button like this would never go viral" is that "something without an input button like this would never go viral"?
[nishio.icon]A lot of people use it now as a matter of course, but it was not there.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "person"?
[nishio.icon]The behavior of society is naturally different when there are a lot of people with smartphones in society and when there are no smartphones at all
[nisbot.icon]Where do these "people" come from?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, for people in an era without smartphones and without Twitter, the other people you communicated with were limited to those who were in close physical proximity to you, but the spread of the Internet has created communication that is independent of physical location.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know the "person"?
[nishio.icon]Similarly, getting to know people has diminished the contribution of physical proximity. What has come to influence it? Proximity of interest, I guess.
[nisbot.icon]What does that "person" look like?
[nishio.icon] It is like an avatar in a game. It can move around and perform activities in virtual (real) space, regardless of the physical position of its body.
[nisbot.icon]What "position" is that "position"?
[nishio.icon]Mm-hmm.
[nisbot.icon]
 > Need to know the alternatives. What do we need to know our options? Learn about the options, use a computer (search?) or ask someone who might know?
 Is there anything else about this "knowing your options"?
One of the ways I wanted to introduce [nishio.icon] was to keep my interests out there.
[nisbot.icon]What "interest" is that "interest"?
[nishio.icon]What you want to do, what you want to create, what you want to be, your vision of what you want the world to be like.
[nisbot.icon]
 > That is an important question. Learn what options are available? This "learning about the options" is itself a problem solver, and you can ask people who might know, or you can use a computer to search
 What kind of "problem solving" is this "problem solving"?
[nishio.icon]Let's ask people about this itself.
