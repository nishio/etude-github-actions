 *1355838911* I went to a seminar on Practical Lean Startup.

 <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4873115914/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4873115914& linkCode=as2&tag=running-lean-22">Running Lean - Practical Lean Startup</a>, I didn't know the Japanese version was coming out, and I read the author's blog and wrote a leverage memo: <a href=' http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20121116/1353063824'>Lean Canvas: leverage memo</a>
 
 I learned quite a bit by attending. I have hacked the groupware (<a href='https://kintone.cybozu.com/jp/'>kintone</a>) that I use in my company so that I can easily draw lean canvases and share them with others. I've been drawing some of them and showing them to others, but I wasn't sure what to do with them after I drew them.

 After drawing the lean campus, we will consider "Which of these has the highest risk (uncertainty)?" and then go through a cycle to reduce that risk. We will then verify the results using quantitative indicators as appropriate, such as "Are there any issues worth solving?
 
 I haven't had a chance to read the book carefully yet because I lent it to my wife today, but I hope to make another leverage memo soon.

 My wife liked that "pricing is part of the product and defines the customer segment" and that the examples are specific. She raved that it was "very easy to understand."
