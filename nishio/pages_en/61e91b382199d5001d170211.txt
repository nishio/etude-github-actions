(5.2.4.1) Group organization is not objective
I explained about the pattern discovery from concrete information in Section 1 [(1.7) Summary]. It is similar to Einstein's thought that the axiom is born by instinct instead of logic. Your subjective feeling finds the pattern instead of objective logic.

Some people try to organize information objectively. However, this is a bad idea. Group organization is subjective.

Suppose you try to make group organization objective. Sometimes you recall the framework of organization you read in a book. You determine to use the framework and classify information into it. 

This classification is not an objective group organization. It is putting information into the frame that others made. The frame is often subjective. The choice of the frame is also subjective. 

You prioritized the feeling of others over your feeling.


On the other hand, some people mistook their subjective feeling as objective facts. It is also dangerous. When other's idea differs from their idea, they judge that they are objective and correct and the other is subjective and incorrect. If you fall into this state, your framework of thought is never updated.

There is no objectively correct criterion on how to interpret the information. At best there is only criterions which many people agree. So you do not have to be objective in this pattern discovery phase. Getting consent from other people is what you do in the later verification phase. 

Having your own subjective interpretation is important. Do not forget that it is a subjective interpretation. When others say different opinions from yourself, you can listen to it as a subjective opinion equal to yourself, incorporate it as a new piece of information, and explore whether you make new groups. It allows you to update the framework in your mind.
