	[Scrapbox] [Organizing Information] Techniques

	[The act of "organizing information" itself is classified into three categories according to its history.



	Scrapbox is a "[card]-type smooth [wiki].
 [Hierarchy] and [Flat]
 	[Classification and retrieval organization
  [Intellectual Production Techniques].
	[Information Organization 1.0].
 	[location-based organization]
  Hierarchy fits
  Not suitable for storing items that have multiple roles or whose roles are not known in advance
 [Information Organization 2.0].
  [super-organization] [bat problem] [your name syndrome].
  	[time series] [extruded filing].
  [information card] [Tadao Umesao] [Don't classify, arrange] â†’ [Search].
 [Information Organization 3.0].
 	[Hyperlink]
  [Connect by link]: Hierarchy is irrelevant
  You can follow the link.
  [Networked Organizing]
  If it is a reference by link, it can be placed on either side.
   Also related to [nishio.icon][shortcut][shortcut] and [symbolic link
  Information is relevant.
  	When certain information is used, information that is related to that information is also likely to be used.
   [The principle of "leave it where you use it."]
	Scrapbox is a
 	Project as a place to put = Information Organization 1.0
  Pages are arranged flat = Information Organization 2.0
  Pages are connected to each other by links = Information Organization 3.0

 Knowledge can change structure when added
 	Hesitant because it does not match the hierarchical structure, the hierarchy itself has to be rebuilt, and it is expensive.
  The [cost of structural change] from adding knowledge must be cheap.
  I also wrote about this in [The Disadvantages of Creating Classification Criteria in Advance] on p. 159 of [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers].

	[Information and Order] Knowledge and know-how are embodied in people and their networks.

  Meaning cannot be fixed without an array.
  [Finitizing] and [Array Fixing].
  [The latter process of the KJ method involves converting a two-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array, which is exactly what happens in the KJ method.
