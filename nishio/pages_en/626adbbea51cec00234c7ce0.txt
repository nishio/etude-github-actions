	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1388384933270331395]: school exams and such are subtractive, so if you identify the mistakes and fix them, you get 100 points and pass, but something like unexplored junior is like "A is A is great! 150 points! But B is even better! 160 points! A is not selected, it's a waste of a great score, but it can't be helped...".
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1388385593193689093]: When you pass the screening process, you are already in the 100+ point zone where there are no "obvious flaws" and the rest is like a height comparison between multiple applications to see who is taller. It's like a comparison between multiple applications to see who is taller.
　　This is a bit of an exaggeration, and there are often obvious flaws.
　　The difference between this type of assessment and a school test is that "having an understandable shortcoming" and "a score of 100" go hand in hand.

In connection with this and other related matters, the official website now includes "examples of accepted applications".
