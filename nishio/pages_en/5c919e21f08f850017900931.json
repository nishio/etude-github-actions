If you're not convinced you need it, you don't need it.
This is a bit of a generalization.
　But this idea is often useful

Discussions when the concept of [metaclasses] was introduced in Python.
 When a new concept X is introduced into a language, some people think "X is not necessary".
　New concepts are introduced because someone needs them, but that doesn't mean "everyone needs them."
　People who really need it are waiting for it, and when they see the new features added, they feel that they wanted it.
　So for those who are not convinced of the need it is not necessary
　　[If you don't feel the need, you don't need it].
　　If [you don't feel the need], then [you don't need it].
	> “Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about. If you wonder whether you need them, you don’t (the people who actually need them know with certainty that they need them, and don’t need an explanation about why).”
 	— [Tim Peters]

　[Hoge Language Paradox]
　　Language features that are not [useful] are perceived as having "unnecessary features.
