Case study of finding links between books through speed reading
Benefits of speed reading: Compression of resources (memory and time) per book allows multiple books to be placed on limited resources, making it easier to discover relationships across books.

>Speedy Reading Practice "Psychological Negotiation Techniques Taught at the FBI Academy"
>Power is colorless and transparent, just a means to an end, and good or evil depends on the end. What you assume to be unmovable "rules" are just "the product of human negotiation" and can be moved through negotiation. There are two types of negotiations: those that aim for win-win and those that aim only for your win, but you need to be familiar with both because the other party may use the latter, and so on.
>I usually live in a mutually beneficial community and have a habit of inferring that the other party is trying to win-win by default, but such people are vulnerable to attacks by selfish people. I don't feel that this book will make me a stronger negotiator, but I thought it might be beneficial to improve my ability to defend myself by knowing what kind of attacks are possible.

>Speedy Reading Exercise "Jeff Bezos Endless Ambition"
>I read this book next to a book on negotiation techniques because they happened to be next to each other on the bookshelf, but it was very interesting to see how many times examples of negotiation techniques from the book I had just read appeared in this completely independent book.
>One of the benefits of speed reading is that the resources (memory and time) per book are compressed, so that multiple books can be placed on a limited resource, making it easier to discover relationships across books, right?
