loop detection
 Given [$ f(x)], I want to find [$ f^n(x)] fast
 　The domain and value range of f are common finite sets
 　The starting point x is a single
 　If the size of the definition region is D and the maximum value of n is N, then the pre-processing O(D) can be made into the main process O(1)
	pretreatment
	　Prepare two arrays A and B
　	[$ A: f^i(x) \to i]
　	[$ B: i \to f^i(x)]
　Fill this array by incrementing i
　If Ai is not the initial value, it is a loop
　Can be determined by constant order.
　Worst case scenario, a loop is found by D
	main processing
		i, Ai to the loop and the length of the path and the length of the loop until it enters the loop.
 		loop_start = Ai
 		loop_length = i - Ai
		Constant Order [$ f^n(x) = (n - A_i) \% (i - A_i)]
