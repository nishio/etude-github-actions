The misconception that "only humans can create new things.
 Random mutation and natural selection have produced a wide variety of life
 Natural selection is a system of "make it, experiment to see if it works," "throw away the ones that didn't work well, and keep the ones that worked well.
 Supervised learning is a system that makes a part of the program "changeable parameters," experiments with different parameters, checks with the supervised data to see if it works well, discards what does not work, and keeps what does work.
  Efficiency is enhanced by the fact that "how to change parameters" is not random but somewhat contrived.
 Reinforcement learning is a mechanism in which a human gives a "degree of working well" and the machine searches for good parameters by trial and error instead of giving teacher data.
  In a subject like Go, which "can be experimented with at high simulation speeds," it can experiment and grow many orders of magnitude more than human trial-and-error.
