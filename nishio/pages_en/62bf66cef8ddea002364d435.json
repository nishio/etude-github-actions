　Center Press (example on this page)

Communication a few days ago
　Wife: "I bought one for myself because my husband's looked cooler, and I thought there would be no distinction if I bought the same one, but the ladies' was center-press."
 I said, "What's a center press?"
 Wife: "It's designed with the folds in front of the legs."
 I said, "Oh, that."

A few days after this exchange, as I picked up the dry laundry, I thought, "Oh, this isn't mine because it's center pressed."
　Then I wondered, "If I hadn't learned the term "center press," would I have made the distinction?" I thought.

I noticed the difference in shades after I took the pictures and laid them out.
　This is not an intentional difference, but one that has faded due to UV rays or something else with use.
　So if you use this as a point of distinction, eventually you won't be able to tell the difference.
