[Many people are worried that they will forget the details if they take [fragmentary notes] out of context.
Such people try to take [long notes].

[Explorations in Knowledge] p. 117 [point memo and recall] [point memo] and [recall] [union] will form [memory].

p.118
	>The point memos are not just a chronological sequence, but are cut into pieces and [spatially rearranged] to create a semantically comprehensible diagram. In other words, it is [structured]. This process, to my surprise, brought back vivid memories even after a week, or even a year or more. Moreover, even relevant details that are not written down are fleshed out to some extent.

In other words, Jiro Kawakita's subjective [memory recall] was improved when he took notes in pieces and reconstructed them spatially, rather than taking notes in [one-dimensional sentences] according to chronological order due to anxiety about forgetting details.
This is probably [Craik&Tulving 1975]'s effect that the more cognitively sophisticated you are, the more your memory will stick. The act of trying to write down as much incoming information as possible on the spot is not cognitively sophisticated. The process of taking it apart and structuring it is cognitively sophisticated because you are thinking about meaning.
