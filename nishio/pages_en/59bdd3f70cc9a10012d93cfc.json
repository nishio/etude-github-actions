programmer
If there is a situation in which a programmer can have some special insight into how to learn, what is it? I was thinking about this. The fact that they use a "language" called "programming language" as a tool to create things. The "language" is not a natural language but an artificial language, and the language itself has been repeatedly improved over a short period of less than a century, accumulating many layers of abstraction. This is a characteristic not seen in other fields.

The "creation of words and the creation of layers of abstraction" itself occurs in every field in the form of so-called "jargon.

There are examples in natural language, such as novelists and playwrights, of "using language as a tool to create things."
