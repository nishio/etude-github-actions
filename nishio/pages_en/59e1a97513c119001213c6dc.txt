Simplification of existing games

decision-making
 If there is no room for decision-making, it doesn't work as a game.
 It's not fun even when the right choices for decision-making are obvious.
 Don't make it too difficult.


Competition for limited resources

card counting
 Non-reciprocal extraction from a set of cards with known distribution

 Simple when the distribution is not changed.


brah
	In poker and other baccine games, in which the player has a cost of 1 for participating in the bet and a reward of 2 for winning, the player makes A choose "not to participate" by making A believe that "A's chance of winning is less than 1/2".
 This means that there must be a situation where A "calculates his win rate according to B's manipulable behavior"
