 I feel that my productivity will increase by about an order of magnitude if I can quickly retrieve what I want to retrieve. I can't find the Windows disk I thought I bought a while ago, so I bought a new disk and now it's missing again. I used it just a few days ago.
 
 Considering that I will probably have more trouble remembering things as I get older, I should put all the easy-to-understand procedures in one place now and look at the bottom of the page when I don't understand something.
