 *1383544532* Binary Carta is interesting.
 I am participating in Security Mini-Camp in Yokohama as an instructor. I enjoyed Mr. Sakai's Binary Carta and Binary Calendar so much that I made my own conversion script.
 
 Binary Carta: http://kozos.jp/binary-karuta/
 Binary Calendar: http://kozos.jp/binary-calendar/
 
 Script I wrote: https://github.com/nishio/binary_color
 
 This is a conversion of the script itself with this script.

 It consists roughly of red (readable area), with green (control code area) for line breaks in places. Incidentally, the dark red areas are codes that convert 0-255 into RGB colors, so there are more numbers and symbols than other codes.
 
 Here is the Python bytecode compiled from this script.

 The left-descending diagonals often appear because Python bytecode is often three bytes, one byte for the instruction and two bytes for the argument.
 
 By the way, here is a compiled Java program that just displays Hello.

 The light blueish area of the first four letters is CAFEBABE.
