Project Selection Problem
　There are N projects.
　Doing project i yields income [$ r_i
　There are m machines.
　Buying machine j costs [$ c_j
 In order to do a project, you have to buy the machinery needed for that project.
　Which project should I choose to maximize profit = revenue - cost?

　Solvable by [minimum cut]([maximum flow])

　[minimum cut is not "cut on the edges"].
　　Easier to understand if interpreted as vertex painting
　　The project painted in the same color as the start is the "selected project"
　　Machines painted the same color are "purchased machines."

	　In the figure, -p should be read as r

----
The following explanation is not a good explanation because it was written before I understood [cutting the smallest cut is not "cutting an edge"].

　There are N projects.
　There are m machines.
　Project requires some machinery
　Choosing project pi yields income r(pi)
　Buying the required machine qj costs c(qj)
　Which project should I choose to maximize profit-cost?
　Solvable by [minimum cut]([maximum flow])

	Express the constraint, "If a project is selected, we must buy the necessary machinery," with the edge of infinity
		Either the right or left side must be cut.
		View not cutting the project edge as a "project choice".
		Cutting the edge of a machine is viewed as "buying a machine".
		If you have selected a project (not cutting an edge), you need to buy a machine (cutting an edge).
		Not choosing a project = less income, buying a machine = cost, want to minimize this sum -> minimum cut

　It can be interpreted as a question of choosing between two options.
