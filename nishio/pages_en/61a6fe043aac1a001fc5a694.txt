It would be good to have an organized explanation of the special mode.
[Specialized mode]
[Purpose-specific mode]

[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[/nishio/human.icon]It would be good to have an organized explanation of the specialized mode.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "specialized mode" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]I myself prefer Keichobot's mode for general purpose use, but I have had sessions with a human coach as a Clean Language client to begin with, and I have trained on the coach side myself, I know what's in the system itself, so it's a very knowledge-rich situation. It's not always easy for knowledge poor users to do "everything is free". Oh, this is related to the [coloring book and free book] analogy from the other day. So, the story is that we created a way to initiate a purpose-specific session that compares the degree of freedom.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "everything is free" is that "everything is free"?
[/nishio/human.icon]The user must specify what he/she is going to use in the first move, and since there are no other clues, the program proceeds with the session based on that first statement alone. It is quite dependent on the user's ability to create a conversation flow that is beneficial to him or her.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "user" is that "user"?
[/nishio/human.icon]A user using Keichobot as stationery. It is natural that the quality of the results of using stationery depends on the user's ability. For example, if we imagine a magnetic drawing tool, there is a stamp in the shape of a circle for a user who cannot draw a circle with a pen that can freely draw lines. In order to reduce dependence on the user's ability, the degree of freedom of the user is reduced.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "Keichobot" is that "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon], Keichobot, which originally had a high degree of freedom, now has a specialized mode with a reduced degree of freedom.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you value?
[/nishio/human.icon]Whether this will make it easier for users to utilize Keichobot is only a hypothesis, but I hope it will make it easier to use!
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about that "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Hmmm, this question is hard to answer. Talking more about specialized modes, I think that of the three modes, this time especially the KPT mode would be easier to understand the flow

 Where is this "Keichobot" located?
[/nishio/human.icon]ðŸ‘ŽKeichobot
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > I can only hypothesize whether this will make it easier for users to utilize Keichobot, but I hope it will make it easier to use!
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "user"?
[/nishio/human.icon]ðŸ‘Ž User
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about that "specialized mode"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Yes, first of all, template-based methods in the world are often rewritten in the form of questions, and if you put a template in the form of a question on Keichobot's system, it becomes a "template that listens back to you.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "template" is that "template that listens back"?
[Keichobot asks questions about what the user has written, whereas normal templates are one-way. The user can answer the question or ignore it and enter the next item.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you hope will happen regarding that "Keichobot"?
[/nishio/human.icon]It would be nice if users could get used to using the specialized mode and then use the general-purpose mode.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What needs to happen to "Keichobot" for that to happen?
[/nishio/human.icon]To be precise, "it would be nice if users could use the generic mode," and for that "users need to get used to using it," and the hypothesis is that "the specialized mode could help with that.
[/nishio/kei.icon]With regard to "Keichobot", can it?
I've gone so far as to add a [/nishio/human.icon]specialization mode, and I haven't been able to observe if users are accustomed to using it or not.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What is the relationship between that "mode" and "specialized mode"?
