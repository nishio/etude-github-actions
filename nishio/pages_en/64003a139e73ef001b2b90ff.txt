Keichobot on GPT-3.5-Turbo
　I realized Keichobot on ChatGPT and thought that the next step would be to experiment with GPT3 ([Keichobot on ChatGPT]).
　2023-03-01 OpenAI released ChatGPT API ([GPT-3.5-Turbo])
　And at 1/10 the price.

	It would be useful enough at this point!

v2 test1
[nisbot.icon] What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon] I've changed the timing of the system prompt and would like to test it.
[nisbot.icon] Can you tell us why you changed the system prompts and what your objectives are?
[nishio.icon] Last time I did this, I forgot rather quickly about the system prompt that said "Ask a question". I had put it at the beginning, but maybe I should put it at the end? I thought.
[nisbot.icon] Okay, so it would be more appropriate to put the system prompt at the end. So, you would like to run a test that reflects that change? Please let us know what specific tests you would like to run.
[nishio.icon] Just keep the conversation going like this and keep the questions repeated.
[nisbot.icon] Your request is to continue the conversation and have the question repeated, but can you be more specific about what this is intended to accomplish? For example, the purpose or usage scenario.
[nishio.icon] I'm trying to create a system that encourages the verbalization of what is not yet verbalized in me through the repetition of questions.
[nisbot.icon] The goal is to create a system to verbalize internal things and lead to action by repeating questions, and it is expected to encourage awareness of oneself through questions.
[nishio.icon] Well, that's the story I put in the system prompt, you remembered. And you forgot to ask the question...
[nisbot.icon] Thank you. Let me ask you one question. What exactly will the system you are aiming for look like?
[nishio.icon] If we can interact with humans anytime via smartphones or smart speakers, and whenever humans feel like verbalizing, they can interact with that system, which will allow them to verbalize more smoothly than if they were to verbalize alone.
[nisbot.icon] Thank you. Is the system you are aiming for a system where people can interact with their smartphones or smart speakers at any time to facilitate the verbalization of their own inner selves?
[nishio.icon] Yes.
[nisbot.icon] Thank you. Is the system you are aiming to help you gain inner awareness and take action by making it easier for you to verbalize your inner self through your phone or smart speaker at any time?
[nishio.icon] That's the story you put in the system prompt, maybe it wasn't appropriate to use this story about the system itself for the test. The answer is yes.
[nisbot.icon] I understand. Thank you. I understand that the system you are aiming for is to help you gain inner awareness and take action by making it easier for you to verbalize your inner self through your smartphone or smart speaker.
[nishio.icon] Yes, you forgot to ask the question.
[nisbot.icon] Could you ask a question? What exactly do you want to discuss?

v1
[nisbot.icon] What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon] I created Keichobot with ChatGPT's API and want to test it.
[nisbot.icon] What would you like to test? Please give us specifics of what you would like to test.
[nishio.icon] I want to try it like Keichobot and make sure it works.
[nisbot.icon] What features do you plan to test? For example, can you be more specific about keyword-based responses, dialogue continuity and fluency, error handling, checking for API issues, etc.?
[nishio.icon] Will they dig into our input properly, will the conversation continue, how fast is the response rate, etc.?
[nisbot.icon] If you want to test using ChatGPT's API to chat in the same way as Keichobot, check the bot's response speed, ability to dig deeper into user input, and conversation continuity. Create and test the necessary test cases to evaluate them.
[nishio.icon] Ask a question!
[nisbot.icon] What operations would you like to perform using the API? For example, can you tell us specifically how you would like to verify a response as a chatbot, or measure the time it takes to generate a response from input information?
