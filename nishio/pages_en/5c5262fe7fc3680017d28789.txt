One-dimensional cheating reading
	If we compare one-dimensional [reading] to [eating without chewing], we can make an analogy that "it is better to chew and digest nutritious food than to swallow a lot of food [without chewing]".
 They don't teach us how to read in school to structure knowledge inside ourselves. On the contrary, some poor people are forced to practice "putting somen in their mouth and spitting it out immediately," like reading a novel aloud.
