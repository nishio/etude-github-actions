Right and Righteousness
What are rights?
 >That which complies with justice, law or reason. 
  > We're on the side of right in this contest.
 > A legal, just or moral entitlement.
  > You have no right to go through my personal diary.
　In the first place, the word [right] in English means both [justice] and [right].
		I don't think you seem to be able to divide the concept properly.
	　I wonder if the idea is that what is just is "right" and what is legal is "right".
　>The word "right" in Japanese does not include the meaning of "right. On the contrary, the word "right" contains the meaning of "[power]" ([force]), so "right" has the nuance of pushing one's interests by force. For this reason, it is sometimes said, "It is a problem to insist only on rights. However, if we substitute "right" for "right" in this proposition, we can immediately see that it is an untenable proposition. There should be no problem in "insisting only on 'right'".

　 This is an interesting angle.
　　The character for "right" is used for power, actual power, authority, benefit, privilege, authority...etc.
　Incidentally, the same characters are used in Chinese (simplified characters)
　It's possible that there's a conceptual discrepancy between Europe and East Asia.
