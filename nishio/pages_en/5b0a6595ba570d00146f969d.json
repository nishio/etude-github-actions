Dual organization, community-oriented and purpose-oriented
	Members who do not contribute to the achievement of objectives should be excluded from a [purpose-oriented] organization.
 A [community-oriented] organization does not exclude members.
 	We are expected to get along.
 These two "raison d'Ãªtre of the organization" are incompatible.
 So the only way is to create a [dual organization] inside a [community] oriented organization with a [purpose] oriented organization.
  Maintain a broad, community-oriented organization
  Volunteers from among those gathered there will form a purpose-oriented project team.

	[Alumni organizations] are given conditions for participation.
 	So there is no option to exclude people who meet the participation requirements.
  Thus, community orientation is the only option.
  It is a [gated community] because there are conditions of participation
 Project teams should be small for speed of decision making
 	I imagine "up to 7 people" or so.
  Don't ask for permission or approval from members outside the team every time.
  	[Don't ask permission if it's a good idea.]
  On the other hand, frustration occurs when activities are not shared with members outside the team
   Things are being decided without our knowledge
   Create opportunities for involvement in sharing decisions after the fact and returning feedback
   If you're a person who voluntarily gives input and sweat, you can add them to the team after the fact.
			This is [dual organization and legitimate peripheral participation].
