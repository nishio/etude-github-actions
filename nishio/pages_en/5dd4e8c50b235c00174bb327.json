Cannot write to Google Colab's local FS from TPU
from [日本語BERTのfine-tuning]
BERT fine-tuning ran a little and died:.

エラーメッセージ: `Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor: Failed to get matching files on /content/gdrive/My Drive/bert-wiki-ja/model.ckpt-1400000: Unimplemented: File system scheme '[local]' not implemented`

Caused by not being able to write from [TPU] to [Google Colab] local FS
>Local file system is not supported on TPU. You need to use Google Storage.
