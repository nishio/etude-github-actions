dull and uninteresting page
The [tasteless] page.
　Example: A page that is just a list of pages that meet certain criteria
　　I tend to think, "Wouldn't it be interesting to have a grouping of things that meet certain criteria," but it usually becomes a maintenance hassle.
　　　This might depend on your personality.
　　　Some people are the type of people who feel comfortable without things being tightly organized.
　　　I'm not good at "doing" anything "tight", so I feel the cost of that action is high.
　If the page plays the role of "just a list", it plays the role of the "uninteresting" person.
　　Image of inflexible, rigid, hard-headed person
　　Not so, but flexible change would be nice.
　　　Even if the original is just a list or a chronological update memo, it becomes interesting if it plays the role of "something that is written in between thoughts".
　　　 The [Blind Spot Card] page started out as just text with an update history, but after pasting it into Scrapbox, comments grew in between and it became interesting.
　　　Because it creates a story on the page?
　　　For the mechanical organization of information to be an end in itself, man must become a machine.
　　　　A being that handles everything equally without making mistakes and without getting bored.
　　　　Maybe it depends on the person, but at least it's not for me.
　　　　　Not fun.
