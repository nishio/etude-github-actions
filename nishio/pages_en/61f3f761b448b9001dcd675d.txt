Knowledge and Goodwill
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
[knowledge] and [good will].
xvi 
Knowledge and good will together guarantee continued success. A superior intellect combined with an evil will is always an unnatural monster. The evil will poisons all that is good. Aided by knowledge, it only ruins it more skillfully. Wretched superiority only brings ruin. Knowledge without discernment is double folly.
