Efficient from the start
　As systems become more complex, the idea of "[if only] we had done this from the beginning" arises.
　Starting over from the beginning only creates another "if only we had done it this way from the beginning".
　Why do these phenomena occur?
　Optimal design is situation-dependent
　The situation after the system becomes more complex cannot be observed in the early stages of the project

 Optimal design is known [after the fact
 Later, it's "[hindsight]" to say, "I should have done this."
