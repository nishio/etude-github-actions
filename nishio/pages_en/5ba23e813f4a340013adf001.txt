Slack to Scrapbox
From [Slack] to [Scrapbox

The [granularity] is too fine when converting [chat] logs with one line per page.
The export from Slack is organized [per day], so I decided to make it one page per day as it is.
The page name is a combination of the channel name and date. Tagging with the channel name and date is used to get a related list.
Maybe a page with channel names and a page with dates would be good to have the index generated on its own.

Maybe there could be a link to the day before and the day after.
