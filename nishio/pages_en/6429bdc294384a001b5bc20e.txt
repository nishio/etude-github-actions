Kranzberg's Three Laws
>[https://twitter.com/rkmt/status/1642526460438257664?s=20 @rkmt]: chatGPT, I feel that Kranzberg's (a historian of technology) three rules about whether AGI is good or bad to come are all-encompassing. Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral. Invention is the mother of necessity.Technology comes in...

 The first rule is that "[technology] is neither good nor evil, nor anything in between." In other words, you cannot give a value judgment to technology itself. Technology can be good or evil depending on how it is used.
 Second, Kranzberg's second law is that "[invention is] the mother of necessity." In other words, technological development stems from providing solutions to problems and needs.
 Finally, Kranzberg's third rule is that "[technology] comes as an aggregate of large and small." In other words, technology can come in many forms, both large and small. Technology exists not as a single invention or discovery, but as a combination or aggregation of multiple technologies.
What is [nishio.icon]Kranzberg?
[gpt-4.icon]Melvin Kranzberg is an American historian and historian of technology. He is a highly influential figure in the field of history and has made important contributions to the study of the social impact of technology.Kranzberg was one of the founding members of The Society for the History of Technology in 1975, serving as its Kranzberg has written extensively on the interaction of technology and society, most notably his "Principle of Neutrality toward Technology.
What is the [nishio.icon][Principle of Neutrality to Technology]?
The [gpt-4.icon]The Neutrality Thesis for technology is the idea that technology itself is neutral. In other words, technology itself cannot be assigned a value judgment of good or bad, and its value is shaped by the context of its users and society.
 Kranzberg advocated this principle and emphasized his neutrality toward technology. He argued that technological developments are not necessarily good and sometimes have adverse effects. However, he believed that technology itself is not bad, but that its use determines good and bad.
 This principle is treated as an important concept in discussions of the social impact of technology. The principle of neutrality toward technology itself may be considered when assessing how technology affects society and people's lives.
What is your relationship with [nishio.icon]AGI?
[gpt-4.icon]
 The phrase "invention is the mother of necessity" implies that technological development advances in response to what people need. In other words, new technologies are created because there is a need for that technology to solve; since there are a variety of needs and problems that people want AI to address behind the development of AGI, we can assume that this concept applies to the development of AGI as well.
 The phrase "technology comes as an aggregate of large and small" indicates that technological progress does not occur through a single invention or discovery, but rather as a combination or aggregation of various technologies, since the development of AGI also requires a combination of various technologies and algorithms, This concept can be said to apply to the development of AGI.
