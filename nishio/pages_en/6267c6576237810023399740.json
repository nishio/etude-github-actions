intentionality
>Orientation (German: Intentionalität) or directionality is a phenomenological term from [Etmund Husserl], which describes consciousness as always being about something. This concept was inherited from Franz Brentano, whom Husserl studied under, and Brentano used the term when dealing with the ontological and psychological status of the object of orientation.
