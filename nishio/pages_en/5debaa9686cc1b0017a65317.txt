Move the text input field to the top of the screen

	Auto zoom in on text area when entering sticky mode on iPhone
		That can be avoided by setting the font size to 16px
	When I try to enter text, it scrolls to the text area by itself.
		I don't know how to work around this.
	When I think about it, I realize that Scrapbox also had a modal text area at the top of the page when it was served.
		Could this be unavoidable behavior?
	Do you want to design a text area around the toolbar?
	I tried.
		There was a hypothesis that it might be better not to afford multiple lines of text input, so I made it look like a single line of text.
			(actually textarea)
	I feel like this is the right thing to do.
		I tried once to put it right under the toolbar, but that would put the text bar over the sticky.
		I wonder if it would be better to put it right over the toolbar, so that it would not be an unnecessary operation while entering text.
			I hid the UNDO, but...
	It is strange that the arrow on the icon meaning OK is pointing up when the input field is in this position.
	To begin with, I'd like to change the behavior to [add sticky on new line].
		[more and more stickies should be added on new lines]

	The following problems seem to have been almost eliminated by moving the text area, so we'll see how it goes

 	Rotate the screen on iPhone and iPad so that the display does not go haywire.
	 	When in sticky note input mode on iPhone, the text area size designed for iPad is too large
 			I lose track of the toolbar because of that.
		The menu bar is hidden when the screen is rotated, for example.
		TODO: Tap on a white area with no canvas to reposition it to the proper position!
			Or Shake
		I don't want to have to hide in the first place.
