The story of the introduction of Sentry
The story of the introduction of [Sentry
　I put it on the client side this time, but I thought it would be better to put it on the server side as well.
　I realized I should send an additional dialogue ID, both server-side and client-side.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I want to talk about the introduction of [nishio.icon]Sentry.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "Sentry" is that "Sentry"?
[nishio.icon] This function tells the developer when an error occurs in the user's browser.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "user" is that "user"?
When [nishio.icon] user is me and operating on a PC, I can see the error log without doing anything, but not at other times, so I needed a system like this.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "user"?
[nishio.icon] When an error occurs, the system does not always transmit the contents of the error, so we put a function in the system itself to tell the user about the error.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "error" is that "error"?
[nishio.icon]For example, I recently added a function to resume the previous conversation, and I'm having a problem where it doesn't cause an error on my development machine, but only on the user's machine where the "previous conversation" doesn't exist. I wish the system would help me to notice such a problem.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "error"?
[nishio.icon]What kind of operation caused the error is also recorded, so debugging is in progress.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "error"?
[nishio.icon] in the hands of the user
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its "users"?
I don't know who the [nishio.icon] user is exactly, but I do know the browser, OS, and other information.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "user"?
[nishio.icon]So you're so far away from me that I can't observe you directly.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon] I'm just saying that detailed and prompt notification of errors that occur at a user's fingertips at a distance will make it easier to find and solve problems.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its an "error"?
[nishio.icon]Be notified by email
[nisbot.icon]
 > I'm just saying that detailed and prompt notification of errors that occur at a user's fingertips at a distance will make it easier to find and solve problems.
 Where is this "error"?
On the [nishio.icon]user's handheld browser, oh, yes, we can have errors on the server notified in the same way, so we should do that too. For the value of noticing quickly.
[nisbot.icon]What should happen regarding that "error"?
[nishio.icon]Hopefully this will be resolved quickly.
[nisbot.icon] What needs to happen to the "error" for that to happen?
It would be nice to be notified with a set of information needed for [nishio.icon]resolution.
[nisbot.icon] With regard to the "error", can it?
[nishio.icon]It's unknown what would be sufficient as far as necessary information. It would be better to send the dialogue ID for those on the server.

 Where do these "users" come from?
[nishio.icon]I'm not getting a specific user, so I guess I'd better send the dialogue ID in the client version as well.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "user" located?
