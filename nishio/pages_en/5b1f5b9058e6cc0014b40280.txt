VR and Design Patterns
I learned it in the context of what [design patterns] (architecture) and [patterning] are in the original house, and I thought I would never use my knowledge of architecture in my future life, but I never thought I would realize in [VR], "Hey, isn't a design pattern what kind of virtual space should I create so I don't get lost?" I didn't think I would realize that.
