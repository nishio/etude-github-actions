Not "don't" but "do."
I was reviewing [attacking something unfamiliar without looking at it properly] and wondered why you chose the title "attack" instead of "don't attack".

if you break it down
　There's a phenomenon called "~ing."
　I think this phenomenon is [* I think] a bad thought pattern.
　So [* I'm] thinking about being careful not to do it.

I guess it is.
So you are not writing to tell others not to do this.
That's unconsciously in the title.

relevance
　[Should" is detrimental.]
　[Insistence that "should" be done].
　[should→why?]
　[Thought that should be done]
