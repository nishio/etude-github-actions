✅Improved log formatting dialog for Scrapbox
from [✅Make log sharing a dialog instead of opening it in a separate tab].
　It won't open in a separate tab.
	　Currently, the log formatting dialog for Scrapbox can only be accessed from the log display screen.
 　What should we do?
 　　Opening a new tab unconditionally is still not a good idea.
 　　Adding an open button to the dialog just adds one more click.
 　　We did that and improved the flow of exporting for Scrapbox separately.
 There are issues that should take precedence over the one-click increase.
　There is a button below the large text area.
　　On an iPhone, the buttons are hidden by a virtual keyboard.
　　Move the ✅ button up
　Copy text, open Scrapbox, title and paste.
　　Obviously, it's a hassle.
　　✅Add button to open Scrapbox with first remark as title
　　The text is also copied at this time, so you can just paste it.
　　Create pages directly with Scrapbox via API -> Don't
　　　I did not want to pass the entire content to the API because it would have resulted in URL Too Long, even in a normal use case.
　　　Content interrupted in the middle is more disturbing than nothing.
　　✅Memorize the project name
　　　Right now, the default project name is nishio, but users will of course want to use their own project
　　　Do it as part of [✅Save Keicho settings

Current Flow
　Conversation Mode→Share→Open in another tab→Open Scrapbox dialog→Open Scrapbox button
