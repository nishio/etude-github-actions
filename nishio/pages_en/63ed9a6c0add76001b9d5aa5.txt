　　A: One who focuses on what is in the old and not in the new ([one who focuses on the lack]).
　　B: People who pay attention to what is in the new one and not in the old one ([people who pay attention to additions])

　When you fill in the missing pieces, you're just getting closer to "[what's already there].
　A new [future] is created when people who pay attention to [additions] [inflate] the additions.
