Parable of the mustard seed
A metaphor for a small thing growing large.

>Then Jesus said. What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? It is like mustard seed. When a man takes it and sows it in the garden, it grows and becomes a tree, and in its branches the birds of the air make their nests." And again He said. What shall we compare the Kingdom of God with? It is like the seed of bread. If a woman takes it and mixes it with the flour of the three satons, the whole will swell up."
> Luke 13:18-21

Comes up three times.
>It appears in Matthew (13:31–32), Mark (4:30–32), and Luke (13:18–19).
