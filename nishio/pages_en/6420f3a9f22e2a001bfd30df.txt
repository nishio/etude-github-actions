I feel that search has evolved over the last 10 years or so as a mechanism to provide interpretation of information, and perhaps this is a result of the excessive expectations that have been placed on it.

I think Barners-Lee's semantic web is the best example of this, and it is rather mainstream of WWW to think of the web as a big knowledge base and to let people interpret information.
