Zoom with two-finger gesture
	Refactor for future implementation of [save previous center when moving screens].
	[two-finger gesture to move parallel].
		Implemented in conjunction with
	>Zoom is reset to 1x at the start of zooming because it does not remember the amount of zooming just before
		The value is saved when zooming or translating is completed, rather than just before.
		Now TwoFingerGestureManager has it.
		In the future [make position and zoom URL parameters].
			It's a STATE LIFT UP.
