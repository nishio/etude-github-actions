Do you write the release notes in Japanese and then translate them into English, or do you write them in English and then translate them into Japanese?
　Now I write in English and then translate it into Japanese.
　Writing directly in English in the English section of Deepl, if the translated Japanese is wrong, the English is also wrong, and the translation is used as a casual check.
　I think checking is a chore compared to using Grammerly.
　　The tutorial text was Grammerly applied, but I didn't think it was necessary to go that far.
