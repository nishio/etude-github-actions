The more people who have never completed a project, the more "great ideas" they generate.
The more people who have never completed an idea, the more "great ideas" they create. The idea is worthless because it is not feasible, but because they have never completed it, they do not understand it and it will always be a "great idea.


>It may sound strange, but I believe that "people who have never created a finished product can create the most wonderful ideas," and you can finally realize that the work you thought was great was unrealizable when you create the finished product, but if you don't complete it, it will always remain that work will remain great.
