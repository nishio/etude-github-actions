Munchausen's trilemma
	No [reliable basis] of knowledge, logic, etc. can be obtained.
	German philosopher [Hans Albert].
	[A Treatise on Critical Reason]" (1967).
	Modern epistemology [foundationalism] assumes [justification] based on [the law of sufficient reason], but it is only a type of [dogmatism], and [critical rationalism] is developed.

	In order for ground B to be correct for A, we need ground C for B, and so on ad infinitum ([infinite backsliding]).
	If you use "[axiom]" that does not provide a basis for correctness somewhere, then there is no basis for its correctness ([axiom-setting aporia]).
	If the chain A -> B -> C -> D -> ... comes back to A somewhere [circular argument].

Infinite regress] was sometimes written as [infinite regress], but [infinite backward], [infinite backward], and [infinite backward] are correct.
