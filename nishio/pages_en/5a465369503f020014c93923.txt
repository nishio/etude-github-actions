Need a human resource enrichment algorithm
We need not only a [human network building algorithm] but also a [human resource enrichment algorithm].

The [human network construction algorithm] is
	Wide information search range
 Prevent exploitation by selfish players
The purpose of the project was to

After the network is established, information on good human resources should flow through that network, and an algorithm is needed to naturally generate a "high concentration community" with a concentration of good human resources.
 It should not be a centralized system, because the center will be corrupted.
  Power corrupts.

 This mechanism itself could serve as an incentive.

  This is because they gain greater benefits by belonging to a more concentrated community

	Instead of explicitly banning people who are not beneficial, create a new group with only beneficial people.
  I thought this was the basic approach.
			[natural extinction instead of explicit destruction].
			[move the good stuff].

	How [dual communities] work in the open source community
 	Open, low-barrier-to-entry organization that allows anyone to sign up for mailing lists, etc.
  Be an active member of the community
  Gradually becoming well-known within the community for the results of its activities.
  Then recruited by organizations with high barriers to entry, such as committers and other "not everyone can be one" organizations.
