It takes study to tell the good from the bad, but [the youngest] and [the first ever] don't require knowledge, and are easy to explain.
That's why some media cover it that way.

This is often seen not only in the field of chess.
There are often articles like "junior high/high school students did something, wow."
It can be written without thinking about what is great about it, and readers can read it without using their brains, which is probably why it gets by so well.

Such media only use the fact that they are "the youngest" or "junior high school students" as content, so when that fact is lost, they discard the subject.
It's [slash-and-burn agriculture] that burns young people, so to speak.

Young people will spring up one after another, so businesses that profit while eating away at the young will be sustainable, but society will pay the cost.
