books are not honorable (honourable)
	We tend to discriminate between books by great authors with bulky hardcovers as "great books" and those sold in convenience stores as "not so great books".
 The value of a book to you is determined by what you can produce by applying the knowledge you gain from reading it.
 	Even if you read a famous book by a great man and memorize the entire text, it is not useful unless you can apply it and make it useful in your life.
  	[Knowledge must be proven by deeds.]
 It is not the only book [that should be chewed and digested].
 	Reading is [getting others to think about things], and the important part is thinking about it after reading it and [applying it] to your own situation.
