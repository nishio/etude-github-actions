Revise your own judgment.

Appealing to your inner revisionist court makes things safer. It gives you time to confirm or improve your judgment, especially if you are not clear on a course of action. It gives you new grounds to strengthen or support your judgment. And if it is a matter of a gift, the gift is obviously more highly valued by being well considered than by being given immediately. And if it must be denied, it gives one time to decide when and how to let it mature to make it palatable. Besides, after the initial heat of desire has cooled, the backlash of denial is less felt in the cold blood. However, it is best to postpone a response, especially when a man is urging you to respond. This is because it is often just a feint to divert attention.
