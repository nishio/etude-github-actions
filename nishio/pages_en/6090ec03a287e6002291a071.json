 *1267177578*IQ Test

 I took the OUR MOST DIFFICULT IQ TEST, as the sales pitch said, and it was indeed difficult. *Especially in English*.

 Well, it was not so bad, although it was lower than the questions that did not test my English ability, so I guess it is good. I was about to think, "Well, that's not so bad..." but when I read it more carefully, I realized that 124 was the passing mark, but I got 123.

 How economical am I to eat 105 yen squid and get good and drunk before I finish a can of 5% chuhai!
