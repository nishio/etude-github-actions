First, 100 books

100 additional sheets

Usually, about 100 sheets is the cognitive limit. I am wondering if it was the right thing to do to make the addition.
I don't know if I should repeat the grouping in the first 100 pieces.

Information is flooding in due to cognitive limitations

Eleven (11) groups of contributor science.

14 sheets by the Mathematical Sciences Group.

Bottom right: Machine learning Bottom left: Data analysis and mining Middle right: Probabilistic models

The philosophy group (works of famous philosophers, philosophers' works, philosophical commentaries, autobiographies), the intellectual creation group, and the what is learning group are the next big groups, but they are so interrelated that I think it would be better to tear them into separate papers.

I thought it was paramount to structure these three, even if it meant putting the other ones on hold.

First, we should collect all the stickies that fall under "Philosophy," "Intellectual Creation," "What is Learning," and "Psychology" from the remaining 400 stickies.
It is said that top-down classification is not good, but if the overall volume is too large to bottom-up the whole, we should first divide it by what seems relevant and what does not, and then bring it inside the cognitive limit.

You're blurring the boundaries of the "knowledge management," "knowledge creation and organization," and "collective knowledge" groups a bit.

Chaos is in progress. It's the fault of adding cards when they are beyond the cognitive limit. We should quickly eliminate those that have nothing to do with the current issue.

This is a book that bridges "groupware" and "design studies" [Tools that make people smarter - the psychology of software and technology].

The "philosophy" group is too big.

The "Knowledge Creation" is the center of the project, with a base in the direction of organizational theory, a base in the direction of psychology, and a base in the direction of philosophy.
Philosophy is too broad and should only be picked up if it is relevant to knowledge creation.

Okay, now that we've opened up the middle, let's deploy knowledge creation here.

Knowledge Creation Group, 28 sheets

I don't see any books that I should have and definitely should be classified here.
I thought I was a bunch of sticky notes short, but I guess I forgot them at work.
Oh well. It's the compression of data volume by random sampling.

Ikujiro Nonaka] "[Methodology of Knowledge Creation]" in the middle, "[Knowledge Creation Company]" and "[Knowledge Enabling]" on the top by the same author.
The five butterfly-shaped pages directly above the center are a series of books by [Peter Senge] and [Otto Scharmer] on the themes of [organizational learning], [learning from the future], and [emergence of the future] (and Nakadoi's commentary).

To the right of it is knowledge management.
Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge enabler is Masakari, who says that knowledge cannot be managed in the first place.
Next to it is an IDEO case study, which happens to be on the side.
Below that is here in relation to the book when Osborne advocated brainstorming.
Beside them are [Art of Community] and [Disengagement, Speech, and Loyalty].
After all, to make [brainstorming] work in an organization, it is important to "[elicit] statements.
The book talks about what it takes for a statement to be generated.
From here, connect to the "Questioning Techniques" group as an adjacent area.

The top left six are organizational patterns, Apprenticeship Patterns, and other pattern language related.
The six sheets on the bottom left of that are related to the collective knowledge. Below that is the analysis.
The bottom is not very structured: clusters of TOC and TRIZ, Yotaro Hatamura, KJ and NM methods, and organizing methods.
On the lower right is a cesspool that did not fit into any of those categories.

Compression.

What is Learning?" connected on top of "Learning from the Future."
Connect "How to Ask Questions" via "Need to Elicit Statements" to the right of "Brainstorm."
Under the brainstorming, we connected the "KJ method" as a methodology for how to structure the large amount of information gathered by those methods.
This is also a sort of "organizing method" so place that to the right.
The NM method was placed under the KJ method, which is also a companion to TRIZ in the sense of "knowledge creation from conflict," so it was put together.
Also, even though there is no group yet, the NM method is a method of knowledge creation by focusing on analogy/metaphor, so "metaphor" is connected right from here.

Let's clear the area and develop "What is Learning?", "How to Ask Questions", and "Metaphors".
How to ask questions and metaphors would make clean language related books a bridge.

The messy upper right corner doesn't seem to grasp the differences well enough to be structured.

Well, I can do a light re-reading, but it makes sense to write that the map is not yet known.

Gochattered zones, at least separated by counseling and marketing interviews and interviews for the purpose of writing an interview article

The "marketing interview" is directly connected to "marketing."
The Power of Questions to Motivate Connects to Carnegie's "Motivating People."
Would "The Art of Asking Questions" connect to Otto Shermer or something via organizational theory since the author is a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management?
The remaining three interviews were with high performers.

Today's Summary
[https://gyazo.com/b9e06fb11c3e243dd259ee892a3feab4]
consideration

With the normal KJ method, the cognitive limit comes when the number of sheets exceeds 100. In this case, we are doing it with 500 sheets.

With the KJ method so far, "I" am in a place where I list "a desk lined with sticky notes" and I don't move from there. In Clean Space, the "I" fixes the issue and moves. From this point of view, it is OK for there to be another "I" than the "I" in the space where I am listing; the map of the KJ method can be literally interpreted as a "map," and the other "I" is exploring that map.
	Related [Clean Space Experience].

Starting from a certain point (in this case, Ikujiro Nonaka's "Methodology of Knowledge Creation"), we explore the map by walking along paths that look good. When I was looking at the map from above, I couldn't see the details, but when I walked around, I could tell that "this door leads to that world. You can choose which way to go, just like mapping in RPGs.

From the viewpoint of mathematical science, it is correct that "relationships cannot generally be embedded in a plane. From the perspective of cognitive science, however, it is also true that "relationships that are too complex cannot be recognized anyway.

The metaphor that "the KJ map is a map and you are walking through it" naturally leads to [mind palace].
