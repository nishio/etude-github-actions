Scrapbox is not for writing.
 Using Scrapbox for "high-intellectual-productivity-intensive" writing, you can understand why Scrapbox is not suitable for this purpose.
 	It's like doing a load endurance test on a chair or something and observing where it breaks.

	So the topic of "Scrapbox and Writing" is gaining momentum among those who are familiar with Scrapbox
  [Writing in Scrapbox]
 However, it would be unfortunate if someone unfamiliar with Scrapbox sees this and makes the mistake of thinking that Scrapbox is suited for writing.
 Don't use tools with extra overhead when doing a cognitively demanding task like writing

	Be clear about the intent of the phrase "Scrapbox is not for writing."
 	Scrapbox is,
 		[finite time],
 		Paper books with a finite number of pages,
 		Build in a tree,
 		To be completed in neat and clean handwriting.
 	Not suitable for

	finite time
 	Writing has a deadline set by the editor.
 		Or there is no deadline and "if you don't set your own deadline and move forward, you'll never get published".
  Scrapbox, on the other hand, "[is] always unfinished" and "[is] not a warehouse for dead text."
  Scrapbox is a way to keep text alive, writing is a way to kill text

	Finite number of pages
 	[Books are tools of finitization].
  Scrapbox is creating more and more unconnected links and spreading more and more.

 	The [Scrapbox Information Organizing Technique] describes the history of information organization in three phases.
 		The [tree structure] of books is a tool oriented toward [information organization 1.0], while Scrapbox is a tool oriented toward [information organization 3.0] with a [network structure].
  In the process of transforming Scrapbox data into book form
  	Attaching pages that have been divided into small parts again.
  	I'm going to remove the links I've put there.
  This is a torturous process, like "[filling in the hole you dug yourself]".
  Nowadays, it is a little easier because of the "Copy plain" function to remove links and copy them, but Mr. Kurashita did not have that function, so he removed them by hand.
  The final editor receives it in text format and typeset it in InDesign.

So what is it suited for?

	A [collection of essays]-like book that does not need to have a tree structure
 	Specifically, for example, to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Ootaki Radio [/ootaki], 50 selected articles from the past 500 will be published in a paper book.
	No deadline or specific project yet, and you want to write something but have not yet decided exactly what you want to write.
 	If you keep writing things that come to mind in Scrapbox and do "[do not erase the manuscript]", gradually some things will accumulate.
   It makes it clear after the fact what you want to write about.
  You may share that project with more than one person.
  If you feel embarrassed to do it publicly, you can do it privately.
