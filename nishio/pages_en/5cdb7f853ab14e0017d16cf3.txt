Is accuracy lost when you reduce the level of abstraction?
	[All models are wrong.]
	Abstract descriptions of real events are incorrect because the information is reduced from actual real events.
	On the other hand, mathematical concepts are abstract in nature.
		To illustrate with a concrete example, the "generality" that the original model had is lost.
			The characteristic that a model can explain the behavior of a wide range of objects.
		That's because more information leads to more restrictions.
