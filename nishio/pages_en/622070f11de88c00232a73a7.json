 　I felt it was the other way around.
 　When thinking, create a personal metaphor and think about it, and then convert the metaphor into something non-metaphorical before communicating it to others because it cannot be communicated to others.
 　It was this process that I associated with the title, "Using Metaphors to Advance Thinking."
 　I'll summarize the similar content below.
		>Metaphors are not conceived with a purpose in mind, but are images that are already there when you think of something.
		>In order to convey to people the image that descends as a metaphor, we are forced to put on the clothes of "common standard phraseology" and put it on the surface.
