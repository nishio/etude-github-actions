 *1406116695*I turned 33.
 I said, "Not a multiple of 10, not a prime number, not a power of two, a boring year with nothing of note..."
 My wife said, "It's the first time in 11 years! You did it!"
 
 
 By the way, according to my wife's recommendation <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4872904664/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN= 4872904664&linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Yukari Ishii</a>'s horoscope says that this year I "have reached a stage in my 12-year story, and this is the time to begin a new 12-year story.
 
 Oh, some of you may be surprised that I read horoscopes. When animal horoscopes were popular in the past, I read the descriptions of all the animals carefully. Every animal's description would somewhat apply to me. It's called the <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E3%83%A0%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C'>Barnum Effect </a>. But on the other hand, if you read the descriptions thinking, "This is not for me," you will find points that do not apply to you. For me, divination is a random number generator for random sampling. I think of it as a system that allows me to obtain a set of useful descriptions for myself by selecting and discarding randomly selected descriptions based on my own judgment of whether or not they are useful to me.
 
 So, according to my horoscope, it is the completion of a 12-year story and the beginning of a new 12-year period. Is this a useful description for me, what is the 12-year story, and what was I doing 12 years ago?
 
 Twelve years ago, I applied for and was accepted to the Unexplored Youth Program. Many things have happened in the 12 years since then, but the majority of them have been stories that have continued from the Unexplored. This story has now reached a new stage, and a new story is about to begin. What is the story? I am beginning to get a dim picture, but it will be some time before I can clearly verbalize it. However, as a result of my efforts to break out of the shell of my self-image, a number of unexpected connections and developments are occurring. I feel that there must be something interesting ahead.
 
 We will continue to be a mystery as to what you specialize in, and we look forward to working with you in the future.
