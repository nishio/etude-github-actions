multiple working hypothesis
	[Integrative Thinking]
 Thomas C. Chamberlain
 Proposed the "Multiple Work Hypothesis" in 1980.
 When one is chasing a single hypothesis, it is inevitably easy to come back to a simple explanation for a phenomenon.
 But since many phenomena are the result of the combination of multiple factors in various proportions, multiple factors must be involved to properly explain them.
 Thus, the correct explanation is necessarily complex.

 A thinker who can contrast conflicting ideas to arrive at a new solution will have an advantage when tackling difficult problems over someone who can only follow one idea. The ability to deal with multiple opposing options simultaneously is always valuable.
