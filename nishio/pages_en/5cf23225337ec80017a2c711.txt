It was rather crunchy, so it was very good for the purpose of "observing my thinking process."
I took a record of the thought process.

--- Summary
	Enhancing working memory by drawing information
	Faster search by modeling
	Writing it down so it doesn't disappear and repeat itself.
	Working backwards from the goal
	There must be something we're overlooking. Explore.
	After finding an oversight, search through past records

--- Details
	Purchased in the evening, tinkered a bit, then went to bed because the migraine was so bad.
		I tried to see if I could solve it without using my eyes, just by feel, but it was too difficult.
		At this point, a rough mental model of how things should behave was created.
	After dinner, start solving again.
		Prepare an iPad and draw a diagram
	[https://gyazo.com/17277fbaaba90ac6fee72e23698ed9de]
		Look at the front and back and illustrate where the grooves are carved.
			Made it possible to check at a glance without having to physically turn it over.
			"Enhancing working memory by representing frequently accessed information in a form that can be viewed at a glance."
				The truth is, it's most efficient to put it in your working memory so you can remember it without looking at anything.
				But the human brain can't just go, "Okay, I'm going to put this into working memory."
				So "writing in an easy-to-read form" is a substitute for working memory.

		I'm running it on the iPad without trying to physically move it.
			"By creating [models] of the real world, we can experiment more efficiently than by directly manipulating the real world."
			In this case, after moving it around for a while, I found that when the wheel is "protruding on the front side", you can go through the red passage with a groove on the front, and if you turn it 180 degrees, you can go through the blue passage on the other side with a protrusion on the back.
			So the "ring" is modeled as "a combination of two dots, red and blue".
			Can be tried and tested faster than physically moving it.
			But when I got to the diagram on the right, I felt confused and "lost."

	[Lost] = I feel like I've come to the same place.
		Need to be able to verify if this is the "same place"
		The way the diagram above is written, it is not clear where red and blue are respectively at each point in time
		Also, switching between red and blue colors is a hassle, so I'd like to use one color.
		Circles represent the shape of a projection from top to bottom
		[https://gyazo.com/365e620896c8f780b75b2952cc6706bd]
		When I went on, I could see that I was "in the same shape as before" (1).
		So you can quickly determine that there is no point in moving on from there.
		I'm going back and finding a place where I can branch out and go another way (2).
		But still, I can't find a path that would bring me closer to the goal (continued in next picture)
		About this work
			"[Writing makes it] indelible."
			I can't remember in my brain what the state of the wheel was at each point in time.
			So we record it there to keep it from disappearing.
			Also, by making it a "form that can be listed", we are able to notice that "the same form has appeared in the past".

	Working backwards from the goal
		[https://gyazo.com/88ac660ce1da87e8e38204253ee4957f]
		I didn't know which path would bring me closer to the goal, so I worked backwards from the goal.
		Write down the states that can be transitioned from each state.
		But it doesn't merge with the path I've written so far, I'm missing something.
		(Red arrows are written later)
		(I'm writing the black arrow to consider "we're on the straight and narrow here, right?")

	I looked at the physical puzzle again and discovered a pattern of movement that I had missed.
		Figure I just wrote to illustrate:.

		In this puzzle, basically, "only the passage on the far side of the same color of the adjacent square is passable".
			This is because the other side of the ring (blue circle) will hit the frame if you try to go through the near side.
		However, if the other side of the ring is out of the puzzle, this is not the case, and close passages can be passed
	The "blind spot search" and "the power of 'there must be'" that "[there must be] something [that's] being overlooked, [there must be] a blind spot."

	Look at past records and check if one side of the ring is out of the ring and this transition can be used to create a new state.
		It was easy to find, and it was easy to return to the road that led to the goal.

		I was able to remove one ring.

	Consider the other ring.
		[https://gyazo.com/cf1fc2d8f009a67305d78f932f4274f7]
		Perhaps because I had already given this much thought, I was able to get to the goal easily.

So, to rearrange how to remove the two rings, it looks like this: 1.
