Easier to write for LLM than to write for humans.
>[__gfx__ https://twitter.com/__gfx__/status/1643561940848091136] You'd be surprised how often we get extremely accurate answers when we ask GPT-4 about TypeScript. I think this is probably because there are so many good TypeScript texts in the world.

> It is more efficient to use old languages with AI support for development,
> I don't like the idea that this would put a brake on the evolution of the language...

> I wonder if the AI is smart enough, even if the text is only about the official specs, if it can help us understand and use new concepts from it.

When that happens, authors of new languages will create knowledge packages for LLMs, and people who want to use those languages will load them into LLMs and use them.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643813597792071680] Creating knowledge packages is actually easier than creating documents for human readers. Because humans have limited short-term memory, it is necessary to provide knowledge in a "good order", and this is very hard for the author.
