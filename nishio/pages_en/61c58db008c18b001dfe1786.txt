Why are lines essential?

	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468454613347364866]: [why lines are essential]. Without [line], stickies can only have the relation of [proximity]. Since stickies can only have [one place], an element of [hierarchical classification] comes into play, albeit without clear boundaries. [The equivalent of the "Which should I put it in?
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468455136519667712]: This is a [driving force] when [finding structure] for something that has no structure at all yet, "I can only put it one way or the other, so I'll put it [ayah]" and "I'll put it down and then think about the reasoning for having put it down. After placing it, think about the rationale for placing it" [drive force].
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1468455841154334720]: but this constraint gets in the way when it comes to things like "reading a book and understanding it". Because books are already structured by the author. You swallow it whole without distorting it first for understanding, but then [the existing structure] gets in there and there is no room for [additional structure].

[Which way should I put it?]
	[Where shall I put it?]
	[where to write]

Think about the rationale for putting it down after you put it down.
	[somewhat acting and then thinking about why].
	[Linguistic after the fact].
		[Structured after the fact].
