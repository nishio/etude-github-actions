How to make an afterimage mashimashii video
[https://youtu.be/SPOjMbB67-Q]
	Explanation of how we made the previous [RoboMasterS1 running in the dark video with afterimages
		Comparative brightness composition in Premiere Pro
	This itself is an experiment in "how to make a commentary video from a PC screen recording.
		Experimenting with [recording on Mac] video editing in [Premiere Pro] and using it as a source material.
		Recorded at 3360 x 2100 at 52 FPS
		Osmo Action is 3840 x 2160 at 30FPS (16:9)
		YouTube is 16:9, so 3360x1890 when combined horizontally.
		Often freezes for about 5 seconds, even though there shouldn't be much difference in resolution.
			Is it the FPS that is suspicious?
			Should I have rendered the video at 30 FPS first?
				Or [proxy video].
				I'll experiment next time.
		[I spun the RoboMaster S1 at high speed!] when I used the iPad recording, but this one did not have that problem!
			This is also 59FPS, but it was an iPhone, so 1334 x 750

	Audio is recorded
	[Keep Frame" is useful.
		Or that an important scene is only on video for a moment.
		You have a long audio explanation, so you want to stop the video during that time.
		Retain specific frames of video in such cases.
	Conversely, the [Rate Adjustment Tool] is useful when you want to shrink the video to fit the audio.

	I couldn't figure out how to duplicate the video selection elsewhere.
		I'll give you a quick rundown of what I'm about to explain first" in the beginning of the video, and I'm using some of the latter part of the video.
		I thought that if I set up an in/out and copied it, that area would be copied, but it wasn't.
		I thought I could set up an in/out and drag-drop it onto the timeline from the preview screen, but not so.
		I had no choice but to cut it with leather and copy and paste that area only.
		If you do this, you will have to be aware of the separate clips when you apply effects or duration settings to the range later, which can be a hassle.
