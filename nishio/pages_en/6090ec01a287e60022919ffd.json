 **1251969588*[Midterm] Midterm API version 2
 About a day before yesterday, I gave a presentation on version 1 at a programming symposium and found various problems, so I made a revised version 2.

 Also, the previous ML was lost because it was set up to disappear without flow, so I created a new one with Google Group.

 Now I just need to make a game win/loss indicator or something...

 form = cgi.FieldStorage()
 query = form["query"].value
 if query == "available":
     if form["version"].value == "2":
         print "2OK"
     else:
         print "NG"

     hand = [
