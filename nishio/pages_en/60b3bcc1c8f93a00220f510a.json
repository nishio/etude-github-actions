The rational path in the short term is scorched earth.
The rational path in the short term is [scorched earth], so there is merit in taking the path that is a little more "[irrational in the short term] but [rational in the long term]" than the rest of the world.

To benefit from a situation that is "reasonable in the long run," it needs to continue over the long term, so it probably needs to be something that caters to personal preferences, such as "I like that."
If you look at it quantitatively, "irrational in the short term" means "loss in the short term." The reason why we can continue to do something that is a loss is because there is a non-objective benefit in it. There is a "benefit that is different from the general public," such as subjectively liking it and feeling enjoyment from it.
