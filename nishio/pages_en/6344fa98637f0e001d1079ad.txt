	>I feel that when you start something new, hardships always follow. For example, when we switched from [contracted development] to a business that utilizes our own products, there were various waves. In the case of contracted development, the client has already validated the business model, so [work that turns] 10 into 100 comes in handy.
	>On the other hand, in the business of our own products, we are required to work to turn 0 into 1. [* No one can guarantee that the business will become 1, and even if you do your best to create it, it doesn't necessarily mean that users will pay for it.] It took me some time to understand the difference between a job that turns 10 into 100 and a job that turns 0 into 1. I think some employees were also confused by the change in work methods.
