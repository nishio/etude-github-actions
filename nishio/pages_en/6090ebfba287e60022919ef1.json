 This is a pretty good puzzle. If you think logically, you can solve it properly.
 
 *1227873943*Bags and headaches
 My backpack is falling apart, so I have been carrying my handbag on my shoulder, and now I have a very stiff shoulder and migraine headache. I need to buy a new bag to carry on my back. I also need to buy a new pair of jeans.
