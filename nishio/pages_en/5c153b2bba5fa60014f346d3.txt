I am the target of the backbiting.
Derivation of [the tendency to take unconditional criticism of others as criticism of oneself

When some criticism is made about a particular person X, the hypothesis that "a good percentage of the human race has characteristic C that is the target of criticism" is more certain than the hypothesis that "only person X is unique among the human race and is therefore the target of criticism".

If the size of the target set of humans is N, the larger N is, the more likely it is that we can observe it, so the size of the set of humans with characteristic C is likely to be large, given the fact that we can observe it now.

Then there is a good chance that you will be included in that set.

[You don't see people as individuals?

[Shady talk] is for [myself].
