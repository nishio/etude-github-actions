 *1317432699*GTD Leverage Memo as Mind Map Part 2
 I redrew the <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20110930/1317394083'>GTD Leverage Memo as Mind Map</a> I drew yesterday after a night's sleep.
 
 The line through which the information flowed was unified in red, and the questions to it were changed to light blue because pink would not stand out. The "places to store information" such as lists were made into a picture of a box. Also, when I was organizing it, I thought it would be hard to connect the fourth "review" on the bottom line with everything else. I thought it would be better to put "Planning" here, and "Natural Planning Model" which is mentioned in this book but not in the previous diagram, and so on.

 It is important to think about the process of mind mapping, not the result of drawing. The reason why my task list is overflowing and salted tasks are being created so quickly is because of the questions I have clearly stated in the speech balloons, such as "Why do this task? or "Is this task concrete? and "Is this task concrete?
 
 Also, in my weekly review, I started reviewing the "Someday" list first and lost heart halfway through, but the order of priority was "INBOX of all the things in my brain, bag, and purse that are bothering me," "remaining tasks not done on the 'next action' list," "tasks not done on the 'calendar' list," and "waiting for reply list," "project list," and "someday. I guess my priorities were wrong, since they were "Waiting for reply list," "Project list," and "Someday."
