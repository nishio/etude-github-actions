> MIT researchers tested 444 people to see how productive they were at work (especially writing) using ChatGPT
> As a result, the group using ChatGPT finished their work 37% faster and the quality of their work improved by 20%.
>The output by ChatGPT is messy, so the time taken to edit it seems to have been more, but the benefits of lower beginning writing costs far outweigh that.
