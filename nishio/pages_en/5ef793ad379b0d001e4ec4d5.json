principle of inclusion
When the number of cases of an event is difficult to count directly, it is solved by dividing it into smaller and simpler counts [problem division]. When the partial events are the exclusion, they simply add up, but even if they do not, the inclusion-division principle can be used if the common part can be found.

[$ | A \cup B | = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| ]

It can also be interpreted as expressing a combination of [binary feature].

	When you want to find 000 but it is difficult to find it directly, calculate *** - (1** + *1* + **1) + (11* + 1*1 + *11) - (111)
	In particular, if the size f(k) of the set is determined by the number k of 1s

  > Pi = (the event that Ai=Bi), we want to find #(¬P1 ∧ ¬P2 ∧ ¬P3), and #(P1) or #(P1 ∧ P2) can be easily computed. #(¬P1 ∧ ¬P2) is not so easy to deal with, so it is easy to use de Morgan to convert it to #(¬(P1 ∨ P2 ∨ P3)) and think of it as the inclusive divisor principle.
