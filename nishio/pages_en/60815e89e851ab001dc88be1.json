We must break the law.
>Tim Romero
> "In Japan, you can't break [the law]."
> "In the United States, individuals who break the law get fined or imprisoned, but corporate [compliance] is different. There are people in Western society who believe that if the penalty is less than the cost of compliance, then it is not okay to break the law, but rather the CEO owes a fiduciary duty to break the law."
> The idea is that if the development of technology has simply not kept pace with changes in the law, and CEOs are convinced that there are only positive benefits for the company, its users, and society, they are allowed to ignore current laws and put them into practice. This is especially true in Silicon Valley.
