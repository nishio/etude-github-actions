I read volumes 1-3 of the documen saga. When I read it before, I probably only read the first story on the publisher's website and some of the stories in volumes 2 and 3. I read from volume 1 again, but there is a scene change between volumes 1 and 2, and the stories in volumes 2-3 start from a place hundreds of years back in time, so it feels quite different.
I think it is a science fiction book from the point of view of one of the demons. I think I can start reading it from volume 2.
