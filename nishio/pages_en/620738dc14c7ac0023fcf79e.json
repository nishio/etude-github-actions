Seeing inside things.

Things are generally not what they appear to be, and the ignorant who do not look beneath the skin are those who cannot be believed when shown the nucleus. Lies are always first, dragging fools down with irrevocable vulgarity. Truth is always last, limping in the arms of time. Therefore, the wise save for truth the other half of its power, which the common mother has wisely given doubly. Deception is very superficial, and the superficial easily fall into it. Wisdom lives quietly in its depths and is visited only by the wise and the sages.
