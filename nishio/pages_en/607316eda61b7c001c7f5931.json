There is no universal truth, and what is true for you depends on what is beneficial to you.
> "There is no universal truth, and the truth for me is determined by whether it is beneficial to me or not"... This concept is very useful in avoiding sterile disputes.

There is a proposal to rename Coq, a programming language of French origin, regarding the issue of its pronunciation being the same as a slang word that means something bad in the English-speaking world.

　>[qnighy: https://twitter.com/qnighy/status/1380816037214515201] Coq is software from the French-speaking world, and as a Japanese speaker, I am annoyed that it is being renamed because of English language problems. On the other hand, if many people are actually troubled by it, I would like to support the pragmatic point of view to deal with it.
