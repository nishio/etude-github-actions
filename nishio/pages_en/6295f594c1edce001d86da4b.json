People who have never wanted to make it and have never made it.
There are people who say "[I want to make it]" with their mouths but do not act on it. It is not that they want to "create," but that they are just longing to become "[the creator]. In reality, they do not "want to create," so they have not "created" anything.

　People who want to be game creators but have never made a game and only play.
　People who want to be cartoonists but have never drawn cartoons.

　>People who have never made anything because they wanted to, or have never done research because they wanted to, are only "longing for [evaluation of results] and [self-realization]," and are not interested in or fond of the results of experiments, the implementation itself, or the process.

One of the things that can make a difference is, "If you want to do that kikaku, you already have some [progress] regardless of your application for the Junior Unexplored Program, don't you?" is a big factor.

 	>I want to get to the goal, but I don't feel like breaking it down into NEXT ACTION.
		I want to get to the goal = [I just yearn for the result].
		I don't feel like breaking it down into next action = [I'm not interested in the implementation process].
