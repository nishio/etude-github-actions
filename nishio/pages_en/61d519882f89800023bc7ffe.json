No Mr. Tech.
There is no "Mr. Technology" as well as "[no Mr. Company]."
　Sometimes "technology develops" is described as if the technology itself were a person or an organism.
　In reality, there are "people who are interested in the technology and are active in it," and these "individuals" are developing the technology.
　　The composition of the company is the same as that of the individuals who belong to the company, rather than "the company acts.
　　Unlike a company [an organization with no clear boundaries], it's even harder to recognize.
