Keichobot's value question may be a prelude to fireworks to think about
[Keichobot's [Value Question] may be a preliminary stage of [Thinking Fireworks

Keichobot asks the question, "What do you feel [value] is?" asking the question "What do you feel [value] is?
　It is the role of the "[middleman]" to ask this question and elicit the answer.
　　In the first half, we [drill down] into the keywords used by the user.
　　Let the user's [values] [verbalize] in the middle closure.
　　In the second half, we will ask for [association] between keywords

  >[nishio.icon]Ultimately, I hope that human civilization will advance to the next stage, but even if I invent a great method, it will take time for it to spread throughout the human race, so I want to use a so-so method myself first to strengthen my own intellect. I feel the value of a method that I feel is strengthening my intelligence, and that is Scrapbox, Keicho, and KJ legal methodology (Regroup as a tool).
  [Chatbots also have the effect of focusing them].

The question and answer session at the [KJ method study group review study session] led to a discussion about setting a theme for [fireworks to think about].
　An example was given of the theme, "What is valuable to you?"

　At the time, I thought, "I see, it's important to be [personal]."
　In retrospect, I realized, "This is Keichobot's 'value question.
　Keichobot's asking about the relationship after asking the value question and also corresponds to creating a net by connecting lines between the relationships of the labels written out regarding the question in the thinking fireworks.

In other words, Keichobot (and the [symbolic modeling] on which it is based) is a technology that occupies an "overlapping and slightly preliminary stage" to thinking fireworks
　[KJ method study group review study group#63a159e0aff09e000071597e].
　KJ Method ← Exploration Net ← Thinking Fireworks."
　I talked about the gradual emergence of preliminary technologies over time.
　Keichobot could be positioned as such.
　KJ method←Exploratory Net←Thinking Fireworks←Keichobot
　In fact, here he says, "If it's one-on-one (= if you have time to spare), I'll dig into it with symbolic modeling questions."
　　[KJ method study group review study group#639abbe4aff09e0000bb77b1]
　　The reason we use "Keichobot" instead of "symbolic modeling" for the preliminary technology is that Keichobot is a chatbot, so it is important that it can be used by one person.
