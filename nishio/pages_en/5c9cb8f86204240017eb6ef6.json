 Reviews are an end, not a means.
 So if the purpose of the review is to successfully turn the daily tasks around, then there's no need for a review.
 There is no need to ritualize the unnecessary, and there is no need to feel guilty about not being able to perform the ritual.
 	Related [Ritualization of Means].
	Just do a review when problems arise in your daily routine.
	We call this an abortive review, a metaphor for an abortive medication taken when symptoms arise.
