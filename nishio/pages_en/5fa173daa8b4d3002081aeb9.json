Thoughts.
　In short, the problem of tracing a directed graph
　The number of steps K to follow is 10^100000
　The tracing part can be solved by [doubling], but I'd rather not do the binary expansion of K
　So, instead of doubling the doubling, we multiply it by 10 so that the decimal notation can be handled as it is.
Official Explanation
　[Loop detection instead of doubling]
　I was thinking maybe 3 x 10^5 with doubling, but not because you have to multiply the word count 10^5 as well.
　I thought I was being asked about doubling huge numbers, but [huge number remainders] was gross.
