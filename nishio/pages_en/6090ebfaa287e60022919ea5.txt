 *1220491239* Hunger
 
 I am not hungry, probably because of the cabbage I had for dinner last night. Eating indigestible food at night may not be a good idea. I should take carbohydrates for energy in the first half of the day. The question is whether you should take it even if you are not hungry.

 This bowl was too big for miso soup.

 The question is "Answer the smallest integer that is equal to the given integer N and the number of 1's standing in binary notation and is greater than N." First I think vaguely of 1000 or 1111 and think, "I'll have to double the number to 1000, so I'll have to find it while +1 and time out. Next, I think, "Next to 1111, I thought it would be 11110, but it's 10111. It's not easy.
 
 I'll ramble on for a while and it won't clear up, so I'll write it down until I understand the regularity.

 Hmmm. In short, I understand that "find the lowest sequence of 01 and change it to 10" and "collect 000111 and 1 in the last digit since the digit below the changed position is greater than N, no matter how it is numbered.
 
 I first calculated how many 1's stood for N, but that wasn't necessary.
 
 >|cpp|
 class NextNumber {
 public:
   vector<int> vecize(int N){
     vector<int> buf;
     while(N){
       buf += N % 2;
       N /= 2;
     }
     return buf;
   }
   int getNextNumber(int N) {
     vector<int> input = vecize(N);
     size_t KETA = input.size();
     input += 0;
     int diff = 0;
     for(size_t i=0; i<KETA; i++){
       if(input[i] == 1 && input[i + 1] == 0){
 	diff = 1ULL << i;
 	break;
       }
     }
     int LOW = N & (diff - 1ULL);
     vector<int> lower = vecize(LOW);
     int wlow = accumulate(lower.begin(), lower.end(), 0);
     return N + diff - LOW + (1ULL << wlow) - 1;
   }

 And my rating dropped 7 points...tough. I solved the Easy problem in 22 minutes, but I heard it was too late.

 <body>I made a mistake in a rush. <br> mask = (upper ^ (upper-1)) >> 2<br> lower = (1 << (count(mask&x))) -1<br> is true (though the result is the same)</body>
