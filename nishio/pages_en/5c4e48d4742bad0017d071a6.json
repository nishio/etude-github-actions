Wiki is not a dictionary
	Taking [Wiki] as a metaphor for [dictionary] is harmful.
	　It would increase the limitation that "the text is a description of the words in the title"
	Dictionary headwords have more noun forms than the actual frequency of occurrence
		So to think of it as a dictionary reinforces [the preoccupation with the noun form].
	Wikipedia is a service designed to create an encyclopedia
	　It became very visible due to its great success.
	　Some people even call Wikipedia a Wiki.
	　But that one has a strong restriction on the content: "appropriate as an encyclopedia article.
	　　Clear constraints on the cooperation of an unspecified number of people would have been useful.
	　If you assume that a wiki is meant to be used like Wikipedia, you're needlessly putting yourself in a position of constraint.
	A personal wiki is something you create for your future self to enjoy reading.
 	The "[page title]" should be something that triggers the desire to read.
		Writing dictionary-like explanations for words I already know is not fun for me to read.
	If you keep it open to the public, it sometimes gets mentioned on social networking sites ([social trigger]).
	　I'll read it back to myself then.
	　Reading it again after a period of time allows you to view it from a different perspective
	　Rewrite immediately, rewrite expressions or add new ideas
	　This is how content grows.
	Maybe not when you're using it in a groupware kind of way.

　　>Writing a dictionary-like explanation for a word I already know is not enjoyable for me to read.
　　　It is better for me to write a one-line explanation of a word that I know but that other members may not know, than for each of them to Google the word and read the official website to understand what it means.
　　　Less information, with a link to the official website
