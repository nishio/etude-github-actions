Oblique Strategies
>One of the most interesting projects in [Brian Eno's] work is "Oblique Strategies," a collaboration with composer Peter Schmick in the mid-1970s. 115 white cards in a set, each with a sentence or phrase written on it, are used to draw from a well-cut stack of cards to get ideas and inspiration away from old thinking when you hit a wall during your creative process. When faced with a creative challenge, one can draw a card from a set of well-cut cards to get an idea or inspiration away from old thoughts.

>The goal of the cards (per Brian Eno) is “not final, as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident”; personally I find it best used to “trust” the card even if it is unclear. Let it drive you down a different path that wasn’t initially evident.
(DeepL) The goal of the cards is (according to Brian Eno) "not to be final, but to present new ideas or make other things self-evident". Personally, I believe the best use of the cards is to "believe" them, even if they are unclear. The cards will show you another way that wasn't obvious at first.
