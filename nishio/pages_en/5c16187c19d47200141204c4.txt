	Some people are afraid of [negative] [feedback] and feel
	I think there are many things to be afraid of, about some of them.

	[There is] nothing that all people admire.
	No matter what you make, there will always be people who are unhappy with it.
	[It's as natural as cicadas chirping in the summer.
