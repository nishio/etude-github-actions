 Thoughts.
 　I wonder if it ever doesn't exist.
 　　If A1 is determined, A2 is A1^B1 from the condition
 　　 A3 is A1^B1^B2
 　　If all B's are XORed to 0, they exist.
 　　Once A1 is determined, all the rest are determined, so the minimum dictionary order is to set A1 to 0.
 　It shouldn't be this easy...am I missing something?
　Official Explanation
　　That's right (used when recalling forgotten information, etc.)
