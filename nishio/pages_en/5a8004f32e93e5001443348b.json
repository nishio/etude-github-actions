Regarding project continuity
Causes that undermine continuity
	Continuity of Funds
 	May we abandon projects that have no prospect of obtaining funding during the unexplored period?
 Career design of the individual
 	I'm going for a master's degree, and I got a job at an unrelated company."
  Pattern in which a project is likely to be awarded if it moves to obtain funding, but the time available for the individual to devote to the project disappears
  There is an option to change it into a form that you don't have to devote your time to, but not everyone can do it smoothly.
 Deadline effect will be lost.
  There are a certain number of people who are the type of people who can't be productive unless they're on deadline.
 Challenges of the unfamiliar
  We are all unfamiliar with starting a business or figuring out how to make a profit.
   The mental model is different in the first place than presenting and getting it in the form of a salary.
   We need to encourage a switch in mental models.
		Legal, tax, contract, etc.
  	You don't have to learn and understand everything yourself.
			If we can get funding, we can outsource to lawyers and tax attorneys.
   The hurdle is that we don't know how much funding we need to do it?
  My hands are held back by feelings of not knowing exactly what to do.
