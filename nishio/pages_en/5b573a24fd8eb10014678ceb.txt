Difference in resolution between near and far goals

 The more distant the target, the greater the range.
 [even if] of the typhoon's projected path.
  I've drawn a circle for clarity, but the situation at a certain point in time would be a line segment orthogonal to the time axis in this diagram.
 The more distant the future is forecasted, the more uncertain it becomes.

 Trying to predict the distant future with the same resolution as the near future requires a higher degree of accuracy.
  If that were possible, we'd be able to predict the near future more accurately in the first place.

 The further away you go, the more likely you are to encounter unexpected obstacles.
 Even if you force yourself to set detailed goals, you will encounter unexpected obstacles and need to change course.
  A change of policy is not a bad thing, so go ahead and do it.
   But people feel a lot of pain when their plans are disrupted.
   So you shouldn't decide on so many details in the first place.


 Predicting the near future with the same resolution as the far future is too rough.

  So I sometimes get feedback to be more detailed.

The result is [feedback in both directions]: more detail, and less detail.

 Feel like you're getting conflicting instructions and are confused
 Or, instead of a directive to "make it more vague" for a goal that is too detailed and far in the future, the feedback is, "Is that really going to happen?" but rather "Is it really going to happen?
  At this point, the main problem is to gather and detail information in an attempt to show that this is really the case.
