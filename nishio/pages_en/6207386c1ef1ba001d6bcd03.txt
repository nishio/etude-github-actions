Recognize an unlucky day.

Unlucky days do exist: nothing goes right on that day. Try it twice and you will know if you have good or bad luck today. Everything changes, and so does the mind. All perfection depends on time. Even beauty has its time. Even wisdom can fail by doing too much or too little. For things to work, they must be done on the right day. So, for some, everything goes wrong; for others, everything goes right and they have no trouble. They are all well prepared, resourceful, talented, and the lucky stars are in ascending order. At such times, one must seize the opportunity and not throw away even the slightest chance. However, a shrewd person does not decide the day's fortunes based on a single piece of good fortune.
