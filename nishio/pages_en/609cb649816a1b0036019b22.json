The fact that there are barriers ahead is not a reason not to proceed.

story
　As we move forward, we get a better view of what lies ahead.
　Suppose you see a wall ahead.
　If you can't find a way around the wall at this point, that's no reason to stop moving forward.
　Because as we move forward, we will have a better view of what lies ahead.
　　What looks like an impassable wall from afar may actually be a crumbling wall that can be avoided with a slight detour
　If we don't move forward, the wall will remain a wall.

discussion
　Is it true that "if you don't move on, the wall will remain a wall?"
　　Not really, even if you just wait, it can happen that the walls come crashing down for causes other than yourself.
　　Just looking at it from afar, it's hard to tell if it's going to collapse if we wait a little longer or if it's not going to break in the foreseeable future.
　You can't always find a loophole when you get close.
　　that's so
　　If you can think of a more promising path than "going up against the wall," you better do it.
　　When you can't think of anything, it's better to walk into a wall than to choose to stay.

　[pessimistic misconception that "it can't be done"].

　　This seems to be related in terms of language, but I'm not sure how it connects yet.
