Changing words magnifies misunderstandings.

　When human A says X, he often uses it in a narrower sense than the dictionary definition of X
　　Strictly speaking, it has to be narrowed by adding various words, but it is vaguely spread out by human beings saving that effort.
　Often, person B, who hears it, interprets it differently from what A assumes it means.
　　It tends to happen when the context or the premise of the story isn't shared well enough.
　At this time, B interprets the word "Y" as "in short, Y" and uses the word "Y" without permission.
　For B, he may feel that "X=Y clearly from the context so far," but if Y does not overlap with his idea of X for A, then it is natural to interpret it as "B brought up the new Y as a different concept from X."
　B's use of the new word Y magnifies the problem.

　[Semantic range]
　[both "is X" and "is not X" are compatible].
