Motivation and Choices
>The Nishio Family Today
> I "don't want to go out in the rain, but I have to."
> Wife: "You don't have to go. You can send a message saying, 'My stomach has exploded and I will not be attending. Or 'I have a stomach headache.'"
> I "I see!"
	In other words, "I have to go" is a [policy constraint] and can be changed through negotiation!
	Instead of going because "I have to go," I thought, "It's my choice to go or not to go, but which would you choose?" I thought about it and decided to go lol.

>I don't want to go out in the rain.
> Tachikawa: "The game I'm going to ask you to play now is a game in which hit points are reduced when you get hit by rain.
> You are free to think and act on your own ways to protect yourself from the rain.
> Even the route to your destination is at your disposal. You can even craft tools with what you have around you.
> 
> "Come on, let's go out."
	I had a little trouble figuring out how to craft, so I went out normally with a large umbrella lol.
	First, negative feelings were generated about "going out in the rain" as a vague [abstract concept
		It was redefined as a means-free game, which turned into "something you choose from a wide variety of [options].
		I thought for about 10 seconds about a giant cardboard umbrella or armor to wear on my legs and concluded "no, I'll just use a regular umbrella" lol.

In short, it's important to "have a choice" in "[motivating]"
	(Tachikawa) "There is no choice. Wouldn't it be useful to create a situation where "we have no choice but to do it"?

	[nishio.icon] "If you don't do it, you'll die" situation is necessary.
		Also, isn't that "being made to do" and not "motivated"?
		Does not meet the "interesting" criteria.
		Definition of "motivation" by Mr. Tachikawa: "The emotion you feel when you are [acting] in a direction you find [interesting].

	And what makes it interesting?
		That's an option.
		The bodge in the example was not well-balanced at first, so there was practically no choice.
			You could choose to invoke the command or not, but there was practically no choice because there were no cases where it was beneficial not to invoke the command.
		Huh? There's practically no choice this time either, right?
