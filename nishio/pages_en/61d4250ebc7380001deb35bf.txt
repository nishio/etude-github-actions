	>Leriel appears to be a floating sphere with a distorted black and white color pattern that suddenly appears in the sky above the three wards of Tokyo. However, Leliel's entity is actually a shadow that appears on the ground. Leliel's body in our dimension is 680 meters wide and 3 nanometers thick, and the sphere is merely its "shadow.

basic policy
　We have a beautiful material image, so we use this as the original data and generate it programmatically.

I know how long it takes to rewrite.
　I thought about making a video shoot of the rewrite of the gun because it was interesting, but when I checked the original, it was more like it moved slowly and then suddenly came to the sky, rather than rewrite.
