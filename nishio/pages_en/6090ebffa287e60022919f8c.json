 *1242038452*Disadvantages of invoking the Tara-Kiri in the original rules of Gokiburi Poker.
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090509/1241884073'>Gokiburi Poker should be "You win when all the cards in your hand are gone" - Yasukazu Nishio's Hatena Diary</a>.
 >>
 id:tyoro1210 This best move, the risk aversion of turning is not taken into account. / In the first place, I think the original condition for losing is a four-card pool, and there is a cut loss for when the cards are exquisitely dispersed and not finished, and if you win by running out of cards, you just hub the person with zero cards left.

 id:trashkids I guess you are not using the basic rule of Gokiburi Poker, which is that when a player is handed a card, he/she can check the card and hand it back to another player.

 About the disadvantages of playing Tara-Kiri with the original rules of Gokiburi Poker, i.e., a tool where the more you are taken, the closer you are to losing. I skipped it because I thought it didn't need to be explained, but I got stuck, so I'll explain.
 
 <hr>
 
 If X attacks Y, let p be the probability that Y will answer Yes or No and reject the attack. p is greater than or equal to 1/2. This is because even when there are no clues at all, a random Yes or No answer is 1/2, and when there are more clues, the probability of rejecting the attack is higher.
 
 Next, suppose that Y gives Z a toss-up: the probability q of Z repelling the attack by answering Yes or No is greater than or equal to p. The probability q is greater than or equal to p, because the cards cannot be exchanged, so the clues can increase but not decrease.
 
 Now, the probability that Y loses when the tossing is done is 1 - p, and the probability that Y loses when the tossing is done is q. These two probabilities are 1 - p <= q, because 1 - p <= p <= q. Because 1 - p <= p <= q.
 
 <del>Taraiba is therefore always "a move that increases the likelihood that I will lose this card exchange."</del><del><strong>Taraiba is always "a move that increases the likelihood that I will lose this card exchange. </del><strong>P.S.: This argument cannot define q in the first place if Z is the player who does 100% of the tossups. Therefore, if there are 5 or more players and all but one of them is a player who plays the TARAWAKU, the expected value of 1/4 per turn without TARAWAKU is higher than with TARAWAKU, and the result is "it is better to play the TARAWAKU"</strong>.
 
 <hr>
 
 Suppose that player Y's probability of triggering the trudge is p and player Z's probability of triggering the trudge is q where q < p. If the probability of hitting the target by answering Yes or No is the same r for Y and Z, then "the probability of losing when X attacks Y" r(1 - p) is smaller than "the probability of losing when X attacks Z" r(1 - q) is smaller than "the probability that X loses when Y attacks Z" r(1 - p). Therefore, other things being equal, attacking the player with the higher "chance of losing" is the move that "increases your chance of winning this card exchange".
 
 <hr>
 
 If I understand correctly, the above two explanations indicate that the player who invokes the "lazy turn" in the original rules of Gokiburi Poker is the "weak player" and the "target to be beaten up to win".
 
 *1242041401* I read "Angels and Demons".
 <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4042955010?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& creativeASIN=4042955010">Angels and Demons (Top) (Kadokawa Bunko)</a>. Before I read it, I thought "It's divided into three books? What a pain in the ass! It may be the first non-SF novel I've read that I found so interesting.
 
 The riddles were interesting. There were people, buildings, and works of art that I knew. I felt like checking a map or travel guide later. After solving the riddle, I thought it was just going to end, but then I got a surprise. It makes me a little sad.
 
 If I had read it out of the blue, I might have been distracted by the poking and prodding about the scientifically implausible points, but I was able to concentrate on the story because of the right and wrong points already made by "Professor Ryugo Hayano, University of Tokyo, leader of the antimatter research group at CERN Institute". Also read: <a href='http://nucl.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/hayano /angles_and_demons_fact_vs_fiction/ FACT.html'>Fact and Fiction of "Angels and Demons" with Physicists 50 points </a>
 
 *1242063422* hot
 I changed from the thick pajamas I had been wearing to thin pajamas for summer, and when I covered myself with the futon, I slept without it because it was too thick, and I still woke up because it was too hot, NOW.
 
 I checked and the minimum temperature was not much different from yesterday. I wondered why it was so hot, but it was because I did the laundry and hung it indoors! It's the humidity! It must be! Naw.

 <body>Is this a logical objection? <BR><BR>If everyone works under the perfect establishment calculation, then I guess it is as written. <BR><BR>I don't know if it is fun to play with that assumption. <BR><BR>But of course not all players will make the best move. <BR><BR>I suppose the players who don't make the best moves are the weak players, but if all the players don't make the best moves, then the theory of the player who makes the best moves falls apart, and he or she is no longer a strong player. <BR><BR>For example, in the game of Gokiburi Poker that I participated in, there were no players who would play immediately after receiving their cards, and everyone would turn in their cards. <BR><BR>In this case, it is often better to pass the cards to the next player than to play yourself, because there is a higher probability that the next player will not play. <BR><BR>In such a case, you can take the risk of letting your opponent take your card, or you can turn a card that you want to give to another player, hoping that the player who already has two or three identical cards in the hand will turn it last. <br><br>This side is the essence of the fun of the game designed by Jacques Zemet. <BR><BR>I have nothing to do with logical objections, so you can ignore them if you think they make no sense. <BR><BR><BR>As long as the fun created depends on the non-logical behavioral tendencies of other players, though, if everyone played on the establishment, it might take the form you say. <BR><BR>If we consider how interesting it would be if everyone logically calculated the establishment and made the best move, then we might have a different answer. <BR><BR>But if that is the case, I would recommend playing a different game. (I know it's none of my business. <BR><BR><BR>After that, since I didn't receive a response to my mention, I'll explain the supplementary rule about "if you win when you run out of cards, you only have to play with zero cards left". <BR><BR>If you win by running out of cards, then no one will turn in cards to those with only one card left, right? <BR><BR>Because the winner is determined as soon as the player turns in his or her card and the opponent receives it. <BR><BR>And finally, when everyone has only one card left, either the player with the last card or the player to whom he or she gave a card will win. <BR><BR>(If you play this game, your opponent may turn and destroy your chances of winning, so you will not play this game. <BR><BR><BR>Well, the original condition for losing in Gokiburi Poker is "when four identical cards are accumulated", and if you play with the right number of players, I don't think you'll see a pattern of cards being used up until the end. <BR><BR>As I mentioned in my comment, I think that using up all the cards is a supplementary defeat condition for the structure that if you play with a larger number of players, even if the cards are dispersed and the game does not end, the player who continues to receive cards will eventually lose the game. <BR><BR>I think the key to Gokiburi Poker is that it is a game to determine the basic loser, not a game to determine a single winner. <BR><BR><BR>Sorry for the long post|n'omega'|</body>.

 <body>Well, I don't think I can read any more into your text, so if you mean that you don't understand my point of view, then I guess I don't understand it, so I'll just give up. <BR><BR>After that, it's fine to talk about the best move, but I wanted you to at least answer the second part of the question about the lack of fun in the game of "win when all the cards are used up". <br>If that is included in "not understanding our point of view", I give up. </body>

 <body>Well, are you responding to the opinion that "I don't think the 'use up all your cards and you win' rule is interesting for this and this reason"? <BR>"If a player has three cards of one type or less and only one card is left, no one turns the card over to that person" is correct. <BR>"If there are two types of cards in a deck of three and there is only one card left, no one will turn the card to that person. The latter is wrong, because there are two choices. Whether or not to play immediately will be determined by the cards that have been revealed by then. In the first half of the situation, it is decided that the person will win. Therefore, you should use your head and think ahead, and attack so that there are more than two types of cards with three cards in a hand with two cards left, and attack so that it is easy to do so with three cards left. <BR><BR>There is a more strategic rule than "There is a guy with only a few cards left! Just attack! <br><br>If you think that rules that allow you to just say, "There's a guy with a few cards left! However, as far as I am concerned, I prefer games with a high level of strategy to those with a strong element of luck. </body>

 <BODY>I think that the rule of "win when you run out of cards" may be a good strategy in the late game when there is a player with a reachable card, as Nishio-san said, but if not all players play with a cool-headed calculation of probability, it would be a great pity if they just eliminate that player to avoid a 100% win. <br><br>I think it would be a shame if the players were simply eliminated to avoid a 100% win. <BR><BR>Personally, I think it is not elegant game design to introduce the concept of winning into a game that is designed to be played to lose, and I think that overly complicated tactics are a waste of time in this simple game. <br><br>There are many board games and card games with a high level of strategy, and I like such games very much, so I would like to play them with you if I have the chance. </body>

 <body>Oh, yes, my two previous comments were a bit unkind. The point that has been misunderstood, in a nutshell, is that nowhere in this discussion have I made the assumption that "everyone plays their best move". The fact that there are people who play completely unpredictable moves and that there are people who play the turn does not refute this in any way. Since you think that "if there are many people who play by turns, it is advantageous to play by turns," you should think carefully about it again. In reality, it is just that "if there are many people who play by turning, the disadvantages of playing by turning become difficult to understand". </body> </body

 <body>If there were more people playing to turn, wouldn't the cards naturally gather to those who always have a little more than a one-half chance of winning, pushing the bugs to their disadvantage? </body>

 <body>Thanks for your answer. <BR>I understand that there are different ways of perceiving the fun of the game in terms of 'you win when you use up all your cards'. <br>I think Gokiburi Poker is a game with a high level of strategy, and I don't think it's a game of chess based on logical reasoning, but rather a strategic game where players use conversation and facial expressions to both attack and defend while reading other players' thoughts and feelings. <BR>So, to begin with, "There's a guy with a few cards left! Just attack! <br><br>(Well, it's a game with a finite and fixed number of cards. <BR><BR><BR>I don't dislike games with the type of strategy you describe, but if I wanted to play that type of game, I would choose the right one from the dozens or hundreds of other board games available. <BR><BR>I think it's fun to play with variants, and I think that's a good thing, but it took me a long time to understand it because it was so far removed from the original fun of Gokiburi poker (which is what I think it is). <BR><BR><BR>I think Gokiburi Poker is one of the lighter games among the many Bodoge, but if you want to play a heavy game where you have to use your head a lot, it might be interesting. <BR><BR><BR>And I agree with nagakura_eil about spinning, but if 4 players spin in a 5-player game, the one who is sure to win all the time is at a disadvantage. <br>I wonder if this is just another apparent illusion. </body>

 <body>I see. So when the percentage of those who don't turn in is less than 1/4, it is to the advantage of those who do. So that was the cause of the misunderstanding. If you repeatedly play in an environment where there are many people who don't turn, everyone will think that it is natural to turn. I had overlooked this because I did not start my thinking from that situation. </body> </P> </P> <P></P> <BLOCKQUOTE

 <body>Ah, I see, so there was a difference in assumptions there. <BR><BR>I didn't notice that either. I thought it was just a matter of probability that it would be a natural thing to do. <BR><BR>I'm not that good at this game, so I don't usually try to play it that aggressively, but it's a lightweight and popular game, so I play it at board game events and other places where people play board games, but I've never seen a place where the game is basically played without turning the board. <br><br>I had assumed that the game was usually played in a round-robin fashion. <BR><BR>At the midpoint of the game, you can read the intention of the owner of the card you received and think, "He wants me to turn this card to him last," and attack as a team. <br><br><br>The atmosphere of the game is very pleasant, and the players are always looking for the right moment to play. <BR><BR>I think the atmosphere of the game is also a part of the game, and I think that is the best part of playing Gokiburi Poker, but even in the same game, the way you play changes dramatically when you change the scene or the players. </body> </FONT> </FONT> </FONT

 <BODY>Maybe I should have been taught in a "it's natural to turn" kind of way when I was first taught this game. I wasn't, so I perceived it as a "boring game" where some people didn't turn in any cards at all by the end of the game. I'll have to write another entry for this one! </body>
