>Chizu-no-Tsukubai - A washbasin is a water basin used to cleanse the hands and mouth before entering a tea ceremony room. It is located in the open area of the Zorokuan tea ceremony room, and is said to have been donated by Mitsukuni Tokugawa, lord of the Mito domain. The stone wash basin on the north side of the Hojo on the tour is an exact replica. At first glance, the characters at the top of the stone wash can be read as "go, old bird, hiki (but without the horizontal bar above), arrow," but the square in the center of the puddle can be recognized as the radical of the Chinese character "kuchi," which means "I only know enough. The Zen saying, "If you know enough, you will be rich, but if you do not know enough, you will be poor, but if you are rich, you are poor.
