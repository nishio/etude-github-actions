		How should the "overwrite value" range action be defined?
		The range action doesn't know which is later, whether the node is above or below.
		So I made the value timestamped, and propagation downwards is a binary operation that "takes the one with the newer timestamp".
		Alternative solution [propagation down the dual segment tree].
		code:python
		 def main():
       N, Q = map(int, input().split())
       depth = N.bit_length() + 1
       set_depth(depth)
       action_unity = (-1, INF)
       table = [action_unity] * SEGTREE_SIZE
   
       for time in range(Q):
           q, *args = map(int, input().split())
           if q == 0:
               # update
               s, t, new_value = args
               range_update(table, s, t + 1, lambda x: (time, new_value))
   
           else:
               # find
               print(down_propagate_to_leaf(
                   table, args[0], max, action_unity)[1])
