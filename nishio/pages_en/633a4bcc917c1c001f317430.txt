Let your men do what they can do.
Don't let your boss do what you can do.
Delegating allows for greater work.

Don't feel like you've worked with your hands and feet.
Only when you use your head and create added value can you say you've done your job.

being professional
Professionals take responsibility for results and do not make excuses for not being able to do so.
Never give up, think about what you have to do.

If you have time to think [why you can't do it], think [how you can do it]. [Excuses for what has been done are a waste of time.
Future-proofing.

There are things you want to do, things you can do, and things you should do in your job. Prioritize what needs to be done.

Never give up.
[Failure is determined when you give up.]

There has never been a faster time than now.
[Now is the earliest time].
Think about what you can do now, no matter how late it is.

Be accountable for your results.
The work you are doing is part of the whole.
[Take an interest to see if everything is complete].

person who tends to find most things bothersome
Ingenuity is born out of trouble.

Take an interest in everything.
Whatever it is, it will eventually come in handy for you.

[Oni Jissoku]
