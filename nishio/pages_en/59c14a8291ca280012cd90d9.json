People who make ends a means to an end.
Among those who insist on Objective X, there are those who act to realize Objective X and those who make "acting to realize Objective X" a means to another end (money, votes, publicity, etc.).

How to distinguish this. The former is about achieving objective X, so they will try to work with people who think alike. The latter's goal is to use impressions, so people with similar ideas become enemies who compete for common resources (money, votes, name recognition). Therefore, they will be enemies with those who have similar claims.
