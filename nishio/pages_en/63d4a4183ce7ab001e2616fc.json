I'm sorry you think I don't know.
Regarding one person saying, "I am very sorry if you think I might not know X."

from [/villagepump/ sorry you think I don't know].
Suppose that for something X that you A know, Mr. B assumes that "A does not know X" and acts to teach X[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　I can understand being miffed and disappointed in A's position.
　　I can get miffed myself[nishio.icon].
　　　I took some time to think about it, and I don't think I'd ever say to someone, "It's too bad you don't know that I know X."
　　　　I can't help what I don't know, even if you told me that.
　　　　I have a feeling it's just going to come down to, "Oh, you're sorry."
　I think it's reasonable to assume that from B's perspective, "we don't know what A knows and what he doesn't know."
　　B doesn't know "I know X" because it's about A's inner life.
　　　Unless A has stated in advance what he knows about X...
			There was a similar story just the other day.
