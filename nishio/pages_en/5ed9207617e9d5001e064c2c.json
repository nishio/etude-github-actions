Software Growth Period
[https://gyazo.com/4220768990aa56b7302f7f813cb68e62]
　In humans, size increases during growth and does not change much thereafter
　After the growth spurt, work hard to control your physical condition and size to live a long, healthy life, not to get bigger.
　Isn't there a similar growth period in software?
　Shouldn't a program that has passed its growth phase be refactored or its functionality gradually ported to a new system to maintain a "functional and flexible body" and live longer, rather than "fattening up" the code by adding new features?
