Exchange of value range and definition range
When the value domain is narrow (narrowed by problem constraints) or the definition domain is excessively wide (such as the whole subset 2^2000), there are cases where [problem transformation], which exchanges the value domain and the definition domain, is effective.

　[Fenik Wood]
　　Represent a set of values as an array where the subscripts are the values and 1 stands for 1.
　[Dynamic programming]
　　When the value range is narrower than the definition range, instead of finding the largest value in the definition range, find the largest subscript in the value range that satisfies the constraint
　　　[DP E]
	gcd for a subset of a set of 2000 elements, the domain is 2^2000, but the value range is smaller with a set of 2000 divisors
