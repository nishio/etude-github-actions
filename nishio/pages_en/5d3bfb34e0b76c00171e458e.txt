Exclude some tests with pytest
I wanted to exclude execution of only tests that use server connections.

Mark only tests that use server connections with decorators (`server` in `mark.server` can be determined freely).
code:python
 @pytest.mark.server
 def test_server_io():
 	...

The -m option at runtime can be used to specify marks to be executed, and logical operations such as not can be used for this.
$ pytest -m "not server"

[pytest] [software testing].
