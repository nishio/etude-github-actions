[Related Sticky Suggest] instead of [Auto Place Sticky].

	For me, the position of a sticky note is "data I produced intellectually," so I don't want it to be overwritten by a machine without my permission.
		It's the same as "I don't like it when people move things from where I put them" when it comes to physical objects.
		Human input "location" is an intellectual product
			You shouldn't overwrite it without permission until you explicitly delete it.

 On the other hand, there are things like stickies that have just been imported, where "location doesn't mean anything."
	 In other words, it should have a "human located or not" flag

 It would be nice to see suggestions for "stickies that have not yet been placed on the map, but are in the stock, and if they were to be placed on this map, they should come to the side of the sticky I am currently focusing on.
	 "Placed nearby on other maps" is one of its rationales.
	 Strong rationale for "belonging to the same group."
	 Not so much "belonging to the same map," but a positive rationale.
	 I want to be suggested in order of recommendation when I select stickies.
	 In maps with imported lecture materials, if the "before/after" relationship is recorded at the time of import, then the "before/after" is a strong basis for the map.
		 There are several slides used in different lectures, so it is possible to have more than one back and forth relationship.

	Text stickies with the same text string are the same sticky
	When multiple past lecture materials are imported, it is not possible to tell which are identical.
		If the images are an exact match, they are the same sticky, but there are differences in page numbers, etc.
		Stickies that are image stickies and look similar are stickies that should be placed nearby,
		A human being gives the instruction, "This is identical," after placing it nearby.
		Except for the blank slides?
