Angle distribution
[Talk about spikes standing out when displaying the frequency of angles from the origin of integer grid points https://twitter.com/abee2/status/1347785348315713536] (Twitter @abee2)
I'll try it in Python.

N=100

 　You can see the spikes standing on multiples of 45 degrees as well.
 　　Not only that, but there appears to be a small spike in 15 degree increments as well.

N=1000

 　When I made the ticks finer, the 45 degree and other spikes were less noticeable, but the 0 degree and 180 degree spikes were more noticeable.
 　Interesting that it makes a large dent at 180 degrees.
 　	atan2(1,1000) == 0.0009999996666668666, atan(1, -1000) == 3.1405926539231266
 　Is it influenced by the fact that the number around 0 degrees is a "good number" and the number around 180 degrees is a "bad number"?
　Ah, I'm starting to get it.
　　The value range of atan2 is -pi ~ pi
　　int(-0.1) == 0 i.e. rounding to zero
　　That's why they congregate at zero.
　　When changed to rounding (floor) in the -inf direction

　　　Now we only have "spikes in multiples of 45 degrees" of equal length.
　　　　Spikes anywhere in multiples of 90 degrees and of the same height
　　　　Otherwise, a slightly longer (perhaps twice the root) spike in multiples of 45 degrees.
　　　　　Maybe this one just looks longer because it's pointed to begin with?
　　　　Spikes in multiples of 90 degrees decrease "one degree less" by the same amount.
　　　　	code::
　　　　	 87 8751
      88 8737
      89 8243
      90 9243
      91 8737
      92 8751
　　　　The same phenomenon may be occurring at other multiples of 45 degrees, but it's hard to tell because it overlaps with the original peak.
	Limited to the lattice points inside the circle.

		 (1000, -1): -1
   (1000, 0): 0
   (1000, 1): 0
   ---
   (1000, 1001): 45
   (1000, 1000): 45
   (1001, 1000): 44
		There are a non-negligible number of points that are just on the boundary of an integer bin.
		　If you add the slightest bit of noise, it could be sorted into two bins, say 44 and 45.
		　Because it all goes into 45, there are fewer 44s and more 45s.
		Is there anything other than a multiple of 45 degrees where the tangent is a rational number?
		　And it's not just a rational number, it's 1/8, which is a nice binary number.

 from math import atan2, pi
 from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
 
 N = 1000
 count = [0] * 360
 for x in range(-N, N + 1):
     for y in range(-N, N + 1):
         if x == y == 0:
             continue
         theta = int(atan2(x, y) / 2 / pi * 360)
         count[theta] += 1
 
 for i in range(360):
     print(i, count[i])
 
 plt.bar(range(360), count)
 plt.show()
