Cognitive dysfunction
	Some people's cognitive abilities have gone haywire.
 	The sentence you cite as the basis for your claim is not the basis for your claim.
  You're overlooking only the parts of what's written in the title, etc. that are inconvenient to your argument, which I would normally expect you to notice.
 It may seem malicious.
  Do not assume malice.
 Whether it is due to temporary stress, fatigue, anger, etc. or chronic, just a malfunctioning device
 Pointing out a malfunctioning device to a device that is malfunctioning is pointless
 	Recognizing yourself is more advanced metacognition than recognizing anything other than yourself
  There's no way you can do that with your cognitive function broken.
