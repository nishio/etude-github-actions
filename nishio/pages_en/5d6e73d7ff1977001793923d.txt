You can choose four of the following for placement
	subscribe button
	Link to the latest videos
	Links to recommended videos
	Link to video selected by author

It would be better to have a screen to provide links to related videos, since it is disturbing to put a link over a video that explains something.

		Can be put in the last 20 seconds.
		I have to work on YouTube Studio, so if the posting time is sensitive, it's a pain to find the starting point on the browser.

			subscribe
			Recommended Videos
			Latest Videos
			"English or nonverbal" playlist
