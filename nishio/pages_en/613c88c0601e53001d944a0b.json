I've been thinking about ways to improve the motivation system, but I'm starting to think that it might be difficult to save the "negatively labeling myself," "exhausted from exposure to intense stress," and "chronically depressed" types that are now being left out of the system with questions and advice.
In the end, that system is supposed to encourage people who have lost motivation in the short term to move in a different direction, not to sit there and goof off. Showing another direction to someone who has sat down is not going to make them get up.

		I'm of the stance that, "If you don't want to put it out there, you don't have to put it out there (end of story).
	>Masafumi Ohtsune: Tired or negative people are not eligible for this service. So you can write.
		Maybe add two options early on, "I'm tired" -> "Rest" and "I'm not motivated for the long term" -> "Go to the hospital".
	>Kohei Okubo: I'd like to make the first question "Are you motivated?" and if you press no, it will take you to yahoo top or something.
		Great idea!
