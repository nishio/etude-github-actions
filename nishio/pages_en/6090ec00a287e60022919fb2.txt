 The story of the early business model of "Tanomikomu" in Chapter 2 was an eye-opener for me. I had been completely deceived until now.

 The bread is absorbing the smell of kimchi...
 
 
 Yesterday or the day before yesterday, I tried to implement a+b*sqrt(5)+sqrt(c+d*sqrt(5)) lightly and tested it and found that the results did not match. The code for just a+b*sqrt(5) worked fine. This is because there is no complex structure in sqrt.
 
 
 Overgeneralization takes you off the hard path and you fall into the swamp on the side of the road.
 
 The original purpose was to multiply or divide the golden ratio by sqrt(10-2*sqrt(5)), add or subtract the multiplications, etc. without error. The order of R does not increase. In addition, the order of R is always 1, because all of the objects in this calculation contain R at the start.

 I considered the option of not being open about the fact that I was laid off, which is generally seen as negative information, but I decided to write (omitted).

 Whether you read it or not, I have written the following entries in the past few days with the aim of exposing as much of myself as possible.

 It all depends on how much I can offer and how people can see what I continue to offer, so I will continue to put everything I can on the web.

 It will be very interesting to see if Guevara's ideas will work in the Far East island nation. If it does work, it would make it easier to explain the benefits of blogging. Like, "creating a safety net against unexpected layoffs by continually communicating what you have to offer."
 
 *1245223342*elephant
 I have been wondering if I could reduce the size of SVG by using some elegant method such as "a + b * sqrt(2) can be calculated without error if it is treated as a two-dimensional vector like a complex number," but it turns out that it is simply a matter of dividing the region I have been wondering if it is possible to reduce it by using an elegant method, but all I had to do was simply to divide the regions and render them separately and then attach them together. This way, even if the size of the area gets even larger, it will not be a problem because the size of the area can be reduced. Elegant loses to elephant.
 
 *1245227479* I created a portfolio.
 In the art industry, a "portfolio" is an A4 booklet that describes "what I have made so far. So, I decided to make a portfolio for the exhibition on Saturday and Sunday, since I thought it would be better to have one.

 I have no idea which one is the top and which one is the front. (Laughs) He mistakenly put the seam on the back edge, but it came on the front edge. It's not very friendly as it is, so I'll try to make it clear which is the front.

 Oh, it's kind of stylish. lol
 
 
 By the way, the contents are sometimes 10-pocket files bought at a 100 yen store. A business card costs 30 yen, and this A3 print (front and back) costs 20 yen. That's 175 yen in total. If I print the contents in color on the Internet, it costs 60 yen per sheet, so that's 1,200 yen. Color prints are expensive. And the paper is paper, so the quality is not that great. Maybe I should make a photo print of only the part of the work and put it on the wall.

 This is my first time to participate in a group exhibition, so I can't quite imagine what the environment is like.
 
 <a href="http://www.tagboat.com/ngs/award/summer/2009/about.html">The previous photo? </a>, it looks like there is a person talking with a desk and a microphone in the upper photo, while in the lower photo, it looks like there is not even a space to stand in front of and talk with the works hanging on the wall. I wonder where this portfolio will be placed. Where will I, the author, stand? Or perhaps I won't even be able to stand. I imagined that I would be standing next to the work, answering questions, and when I'm not in my seat, the portfolio would take the place of the commentary, but there doesn't seem to be any place to put the portfolio next to the work.
 
 Well, I filled my portfolio with the same pattern as the work so that I would not have to worry about being placed apart from it. If I myself am going to be separated from the work, I should wrap myself in the same pattern for the same reason. Hmmm.
 
 *1245238156*Re: The instruction manual of "a person who achieves so and so in an extremely short time" and its weaknesses
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/yura_saito/20090616'>The People Called Rational ADHD - Yura's Hatena Diary</a> via <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Hash/20090611/ 1244717057'>The Instructions and Weaknesses of "People Who Achieve So Much in an Extremely Short Time" - Waiting for the Meme Carcass</a>.
 
 Hmmm. If I were to use a photographic analogy, the subject matter is very interesting, but the composition is not. There are things in the picture that don't really relate to the subject. If you want to depict the transition and overconcentration of ADHD, you should not have included it in the frame. Also, in terms of composition, the ambiguity of the position is not good. Is the goal to make non-ADHD people aware of the characteristics of ADHD or to make people who are unaware of their ADHD aware of their ADHD? I think it's the former, but if that's the case, you're glorifying ADHD too much. I think "achieving a certain amount of success in a very short period of time" is a very positive expression, but it is inextricably linked to "inability to achieve results through hard work" like a twisted rope, and the person is aware of this, which is why he/she "cannot achieve mental fulfillment for any length of time"?
 
 
 Well, but it was an interesting text.
 
 <hr>
 
 Well, now I know what I was offended by. If you think you can achieve a certain amount of results in a short period of time, you start to rot. The curse is to keep running without mental satisfaction, always thinking, "Oh, if only I had started a little earlier, I could have done this and that. It is a curse that requires us to keep running until we die, and we die with regrets, saying, "Oh, if only I had started sooner, I could have done this and that.

 I tried to make 4200x6000 data and output it as PNG, no problem. I concluded that it was better to create my own rendering engine than to use a tricky SVG rendering engine. But when you have to output 100MB SVG and preview it directly to the rasterizer because it is difficult to do so, SVG is no longer useful.
