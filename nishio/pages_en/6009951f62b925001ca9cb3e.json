	I've been working on putting a WebUI on it and publishing it since the beginning of the year.
	　With a closed chat bot, you can't offer it right away to people who say they'd like to use it.
	　I finished the work on 1/29, so I wrote the commentary page.
	　I didn't assign a specific version number, but it's like a 1.0.0 release, if you will.
	　　The server and client are deployed by pushing, so we will continue to update as soon as we think of something new.

 Around 2014, I was working on a chat system that would ask me questions.
 	If there is a system to listen to people and ask questions, even one person can deepen their thinking through [dialogue].
 	Example: [Experimental log where I was explaining a new feature and ended up going for a new world - Yasukazu Nishio's Hatena Diary https://nishiohirokazu.hatenadiary.org/entry/20150126/1422276973]
 	Use KyTea for keyphrase extraction, UI is a choice between CUI and self-made WebChat

 I left it for a while after that, but in 2019, I decided to connect to [Mattermost].
 　Convenient to talk to someone anytime from your smartphone as long as you are connected to the Internet.
 　The phone is now waterproof and can be used from the bathroom.
