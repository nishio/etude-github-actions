 *1257134769*[Python] Listing Comparison

 Python, is there any way to check if the contents of a list are the same?
 >>> a = [1, 2]
 >>> b = [2, 1]
 >>> a == b
 False
 How this returns True
 ||<
 
 And my reply:.
 >|python|
 >>> set([1, 2]) == set([2, 1])
 True
 ||<
 
 If you want to distinguish between two or more identical items by their number, i.e., you want to consider [1, 2] and [1, 2, 2] to be different, you can use SORTED.
 
 >|python|
 >>> set([1, 2, 1]) == set([2, 1, 2])
 True
 >>> sorted([1, 2, 1]) == sorted([2, 1, 2])
 False
 ||<
 
 Well, but if such comparisons are done frequently, it is possible that it is not reasonable to have a list as a data structure. Especially when the list is large, the cost of converting it to a set and sorting it each time is high. This is not such a serious problem in this case, though.

 There are people who say bad things about doing something, and there are people who say other bad things about stopping doing something, and it makes no difference whether you continue or stop doing it, so I think you should do whatever you want. People who say positive or negative things about this matter, including myself, are all just saying irresponsible things, so you don't have to follow the voices around you too much in what you do with your life.
