Expression, coupling, and internalization
[https://gyazo.com/41666605f52dc668881e4ee0ba0d1dfe]
An expression of my experience as a book author of the processes called [Expressionization], [Combination], and [Internalization] in the [SECI Model].
　In the process of writing a book, the author's [experience] must first be output as word fragments
　　Books do not have the volume to convey the entire experience, and most of the information of the experience is lost in writing.
　　[taken out of context].
　Combine its fragments
　　To create [a story] to convey a higher, abstract, concept that is located away from the experience that we want to convey.
　　Stories are stepping stones placed in small leaps to take the reader from low to high
　Readers read written books and correspond what is written to their own past experiences or gain experiences that correspond to the content of the book by referring to it and acting on it.
