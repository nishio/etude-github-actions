When you're lucky, move on.
I'm not sure about the first half, but you mean "slow".
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Whether you act or refrain, weigh your luck in the balance.
xxxvi 

Much more depends on it than on being aware of one's own temperament. If he who, at forty years of age, seeks health from Hippocrates is a fool, then he who first seeks wisdom from Seneca afterwards is even more of a fool. It is a great skill to know how to guide one's luck while waiting for it. For luck has cycles and offers opportunities, but its steps are erratic and cannot be calculated. When you find your fortune, go boldly forward. She favors the bold and, if female, the young. But if you are unlucky, stay back, lest you multiply the influence of the unlucky stars.
