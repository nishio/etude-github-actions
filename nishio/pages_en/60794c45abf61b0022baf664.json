Link from top to bottom
A few interesting things happened with the recent Scrapbox behavior changes.
When there was a page with a top concept, until now there was no significant difference in behavior between "link from top to bottom" and "link from bottom to top". The reason is that in both cases, it jumped to the top of the page.

This would change the behavior depending on the scroll after the jump in the link.

The fact that the behavior of links and links to links is no longer symmetrical creates a debate about which is appropriate to link from which to which.
Specifically, the [container metaphor] is considerably suppressed and the [road metaphor] becomes stronger.
Specific examples of container metaphors. A type of usage where the notes of reading a book are on individual book pages, with a "book" tag at the end. When this is done, the individual book pages are lined up in the form of a list of links on the empty "book" page.

This usage means that in the future, when you follow a link from the "Books" page to an individual book page, you will scroll to the "Books" tag at the end of the page
In other words, there is an implicit assertion that if it is natural to read from the top of B when traversing from one page A to another page B, then there should be a link to B on A.
The emphasis on "how to follow" was described as a "road metaphor. On the other hand, he called the idea that "if you put the same tag on the page, you will enter the 'list of things with that tag' page" a "container metaphor.
I thought the change from this time on was quite a strong message, even though for some time now there have been things on the edges of various announcements that made me feel that they were more concerned with the metaphor of the road than the metaphor of the container.
