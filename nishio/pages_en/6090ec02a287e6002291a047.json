 **1260550568*[Kaizen] Cost-effectiveness of tidying up.
 The space gained is not large enough for the time cost of looking through a document binder and throwing away unwanted receipts and such.
 
 It's nice to feel a sense of accomplishment to move what you don't need from a cardboard box halfway full of stuff to another already existing box and crush the cardboard and throw it away. The more space there is, the easier it is to get rid of the stuff, and it is pleasant to know that the room is now more spacious by just one box.
