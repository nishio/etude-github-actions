Right and left inverses do not match for infinite dimensional matrices
In thinking about [what understanding is], it seemed useful to observe the process of [understanding] what I did not understand, so I experimented.
Examples of [the process of understanding

	I heard that for infinite dimensional matrices, the right inverse and left inverse matrices don't match.
	I think in finite dimension you were talking about left and right inverse coincidence based on the fact that there is only one unitary source and the coupling rule, but why not in infinite dimension?
		(p1) For any A, "X=Y since X=XI=X(AY)=(XA)Y=IY=Y when X, Y such that XA=AY=I"
	Counter-example (taught)
	　Let B be the operation of adding leading zeros to an infinite-dimensional vector and C be the operation of removing leading zeros.
	　BC=I but CB!=I
	(p1) is talking about "X=Y when there are X, Y such that XA=AY=I", not "X=Y when there are X such that XA=I and Y such that AY=I"
		In this counterexample, there is no Y such that CY=I
　In other words, the proposition of the form "P,Q then R" was misunderstood as "Q,R if P
　　Reasoning on the basis of that misconception caused an inconsistency in the body of knowledge.
　　　'There's only one unitary source in infinite dimensions, so the join rule holds, right?' I was thinking.
　　This inconsistency must have created a feeling of "not understanding."
