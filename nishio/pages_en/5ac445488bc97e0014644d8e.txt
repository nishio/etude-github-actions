Online Salon vs. University
	Online salons are open to those who can pay 10,000 yen per month.
 Universities are only open to those who pass the entrance exam, prove they are smart, and pay tuition (about 500,000 a year?). and who can pay the tuition (about 500,000 a year?).
 	Some people think that someone around 18 years old is supposed to enter, although "young" is not important because there is an entrance for working people.
