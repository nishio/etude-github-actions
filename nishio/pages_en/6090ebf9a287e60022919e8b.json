 <body>I figured it out when I laid it out myself, but in the case of a figure, I'm solving it spatially. <br>In the case of the equation (3x+1) * (2x+1), I am solving symbolically. <br><br>They are using different parts of their brains and could not come to the same problem. <BR><BR>I guess some people feel the same and some don't. I couldn't feel it myself. <BR><BR>I think it's because I already remember how to solve the equation one. <BR><BR>If you are a student who has not yet learned how to factorize, this approach may be possible. </body>
