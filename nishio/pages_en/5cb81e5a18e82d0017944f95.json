Public Offering with an emphasis on spontaneity
	It is counterproductive to give a lot of advice to people who are trying to apply for a type of open call that emphasizes [spontaneity].
	[Dare to write about the obvious] series
	For those who are planning to apply for a type of public call that emphasizes spontaneity.
		You may seek advice from those around you.
		But you have to [discard] opinions on your own, not just do as you are told.
		You must be able to explain in your own words for the choices you make.
		The worst is "I did it because I was told to."
