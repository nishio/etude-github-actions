inverse mapping table
Given [$ f(x) = y] make [$ g(y) = x
code:python
 for x in all_x:
     g[f[x]] = x

Linear-order preprocessing, y to x mapping is of constant order

important point
　Arrays can cause memory errors when the y value range is large.
　　Hash table is one option
　　There is also the option of sorting and dichotomous search
　　　The preprocessing would be NlogN and the acquisition would be logN.
　Cannot be restored if there is an x that takes the same y value
　　Must be [monofire].
　When it is not [all projection], a value to express "there is no corresponding x" and a check to see if it is that value is necessary.
