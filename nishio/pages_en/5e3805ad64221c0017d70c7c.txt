Deploy with Netlify
I tried to deploy with Netlify, but there was something wrong with package.json or something.
I was not in a position to npm run build easily.

memo just in case
code::
 Could not find a declaration file for module 'paper'. '/Users/nishio/foobar/regroup/regroup/node_modules/paper/dist/paper-full.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
   Try `npm install @types/paper` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'paper';`ts(7016)

code::
 $ npm install --save @types/paper
