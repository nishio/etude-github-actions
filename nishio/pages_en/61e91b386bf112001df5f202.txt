(4.1.1.6) Gradation between "Finding" and "Assembling"
[Gradation] between "[Finding]" and "[Assembling]"

We can not separately think about two things: finding useful information and building understanding based on the information. It is a continuous gradation from the reading focused on finding information to the reading focused on assembling information to build understanding. Either is not superior. It is a choice. You should choose based on what you want to do and the quality/content of the book.

British philosopher [Francis Bacon] compared the book to food. There are foods that you just want to taste a bit, foods that you want to swallow, and foods to chew and digest. 

> Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts,  others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly,  and with diligence and attention. --- Francis  Bacon. (1625). "Of  Studies"

Think about the book which you are going to read. Do you only need to taste? Or do you need to chew and digest?
