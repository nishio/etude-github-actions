Forget to bring books
	Forget to bring your own books to events, etc.
	People often say to me, "Why don't you just bring it and sell it by hand?"
 	I have a rather large inventory at home.
  To give to others, not to sell.
  	Something to give to someone who should read it but would not buy it themselves if I recommended it.
   I handed them out to the creators of Unexplored Jr. This is a typical use case
 Why forget to bring it?
 	I'm not unconsciously focusing on it.
 Financially, they're getting a discount on the author's discount, so if they sell directly to us, we'll make a profit.
 	mere trifling sum
	Time that should be used for questions and communication after the event.
 	It's irrational to consume it for the nonsense of "selling stuff and making a few hundred dollars."
	As for "selling books," there are specialized ways to do that, like Amazon, so let them do that.

	Signatures are similar.
 Do it when asked, as a fan service.
 I hate it when people say things like, "Let's do an autograph session."
 	The labor of writing by hand is imposed on them.
  I have nothing to gain.
  Especially when there is a line, people will line up even if they are not looking for a line for the same reason.
  No one benefits.
		The only people who are happy to have a line are those who want to feel like they're "the big guy".
  I don't ask for autographs myself, so I don't really know what people who want autographs are looking for.
