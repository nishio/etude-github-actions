 ["People have a habit of wanting to categorize things for some reason."]
　　Interesting lyrics
　We're animals, too." "[Don't] categorize yourself." Good story.
　　I like "[You're] not capable of classifying you."

It's funny, I was trying to read the whole lyrics and it was so much fun:[/villagepump/Habit].


[I don't have the ability to classify myself.]
