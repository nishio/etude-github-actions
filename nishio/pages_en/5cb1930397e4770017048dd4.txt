emulator
	Machines that imitate machines
	>When it is difficult to prepare an original system to operate a certain machine part or software, a simpler system that operates exactly the same as the original may be prepared. This device is called an emulator. On the emulator, the software or machine parts to be operated can be made to function in exactly the same way as the original. An emulator can be created using only mechanical devices or hardware, only software, or both at the same time.
	>For example, it is difficult to test huge machine tools and aircraft using the entire equipment from the component design and prototype stages. Therefore, parts other than those to be tested are substituted with emulators. Conversely, an emulator can be used to test the durability of a system by replacing some of the parts with emulators and generating extreme loads from the emulators.
