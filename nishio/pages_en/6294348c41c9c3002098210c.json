One of the things that can make the difference is the fact that "if you want to do that kikaku, you already made some progress regardless of the application for the junior project, right? is a big factor.

This is a good way to realize the idea. I don't think it's a cozy relationship or a hack, because it's a good way to realize an idea and a place where mentors are likely to think of it.
