Business is a serious business
>I fundamentally believe that a business, no matter how big or small, will succeed as long as it does. That is why people often say, 'In business, there are times when you make money, but there are also times when you lose money. I don't think so, and I think such a view is wrong. Business is a serious thing. It's like [a serious game]. Just as in a serious game, you can't win while getting beheaded or beheaded, so business has to be as successful as it is active. If not, it is not due to environment, time, luck, or anything else. We must conclude that it is because the way the business is run is not right. The fundamental mistake lies in thinking that business is a matter of time and season, and that there are gains and losses. Business is good in a recession and even better in a booming economy. We must know that many successful business people in the past have demonstrated that a good business person, a true business manager, can strengthen the foundation for progress even in times of economic downturn.
