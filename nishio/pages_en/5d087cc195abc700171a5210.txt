Peatix account
It's been a while since I've had to buy Peatix tickets.

	>I tried to log in to Peatix with my Google account and it said, "This email address is already in use." I was told "This email address is already in use." What should I do if I'm told "This email address is already in use" when I log in, not when I create a new account?

		A questionnaire from the event organizer appears in the wind that you could log in.
		(It looks like a new account was created instead of being able to log in.)
	After filling out all the questionnaires from the event organizer, the screen will ask you to enter your email address.
		I put in my Gmail account and it said, "This email address is already in use."
	I see. Maybe there must be a Gmail mail address account tied to Facebook w
	It was a pain in the ass to answer the questionnaire again from the organizer, so I forced my way through by adding `+peatix` to my Gmail mail address.
	As a result, I feel the state of my account is even worse...
	Record it here (not sure if I can find it next time).
