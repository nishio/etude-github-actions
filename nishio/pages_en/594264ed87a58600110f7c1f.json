Seriousness and initiative
 Some people interpret [serious] to mean "not doing anything actively on one's own initiative" [see https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10212427183331181?pnref=story].
	Why is this so?
		Is "doing only what the teacher tells you to do and not what you are not told to do" interpreted as being serious?
  If you don't [encourage] [proactive] behavior, you might grow up to be that kind of person.
