	I tried my hand at [live video games].
	Voice and face are shot separately and synthesized later.
	Often previews freeze because of two video sources, painful.
	It might be better to export the video compositing the two videos first and then edit that.

		I wonder how to solve the problem that when I create a sub-sequence in Premiere Pro and add it to another sequence, the waveform does not show up in the audio channel. Is it a mistake to create a sub-sequence to try to handle multiple videos together?
