Few people are okay with a harsh environment with no rules.

 (Diary of observation of other projects) I see... I guess we could structure it so that the main work is done through private Slack communication, and Scrapbox can be done as a byproduct.
 　It might be hard without someone to summarize[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
 　Maybe it's psychologically safer for the "I'm not comfortable writing in a public forum" or "I'm not comfortable writing a page of ideas I haven't yet put together in a shared Scrapbox" type of person.
 　There is a Slack group that I use as a note-taking place[/villagepump/basic.icon].
 Not [/villagepump/wells are the strongest because there are no rules], but only the type of people who don't mind the harsh environment where there are no rules (i.e., no basic reassurance that "you are following the rules and you are good") and all of their actions are publicly available.
 　Those who are not okay with it are in the majority in the entire human race.
 　Sociopaths who feel constricted by rules[/villagepump/kuuote.icon][/villagepump/takker.icon][/villagepump/kiuote.icon].
 　 I never understood "[the] security of following the rules" in such a space in the first place, but I guess I was in the minority at that point.
 　 I'm inclined to think that such a sense of security would exist in a space where psychological safety is non-existent.
 　 　I feel like this[/villagepump/yosider.icon].
 　 Is it more rare for someone to be able to do something when they are told they can do anything?
