Row links are cut-out opportunities
2019-03-26
When you mention something in Scrapbox with a [line link], that's a situation where you've linked to a page and the page is too big for what you want people to see, or the description at the beginning of the page is misleading in what you want to say, which is why it's on one page to begin with. I think you're suggesting a chance to [cut it out] on a separate page.

This article was written before the scroll-to-link feature (I'll find out later what it is officially called) was introduced. This feature allows mid-page content to be linked to without using line IDs, etc., which alleviates a lot of the earlier problems.

Example: [Ideal, Reality and Helplessness].

[cut to a separate page if you want to line link to a longer text].
