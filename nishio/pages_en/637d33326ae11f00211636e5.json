Diary 2022-11-23

Labor Thanksgiving Day!
　Yesterday I said: I was wondering if I should take a paid holiday tomorrow because I'm too tired and crazy, but tomorrow was a holiday.

I'll sort it out after I post it here, which was left untouched and titled a.
　I think it would be better to put it on the diary page than to title it that way.

Organized and cut out.
 [the cost of getting in and out and the cost of staying out].

[When to change the front page of the KJ method (creation process)].
