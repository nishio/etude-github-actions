 Well, I went to the ward office to unlock the lock and reset the password. It looks like I could have unlocked it without resetting it, but I didn't know, so I did both and set the same password again. Oh well. There was no wait time, so it was about 10 minutes.
 
 Check again
 - Card reader driver already installed
 - Root certificate installed
 - User client software already installed
 
 Okay, next time I get a password input dialog, I'll put in the certificate's one anyway, because even if I get the Mac password wrong, it won't lock up the Mac!
 
 Start the user client software and display "My Certificate". Insert your password. Read!
 
 Return to the eTax top page and load the previous progress save file. Press "Next." ...
 Died with the same error as last time. The error code is not in the eTax help, is it? I copy the error code by eye, which I can't copy and paste, and search for it on Google.

 Oh, we'll check this out next time! Time's up for today. As of now, time consumed is 2 hours.
