Designed to keep what you write offline from disappearing
	Local is primary, cloud is secondary
	Should be available locally, regardless of the state of the server or communication channel
	　With online communication tools, it's "give it up" when the line goes dead.
	　But tools for personal intellectual production must be usable offline.
	　It's unpleasant to be prevented by external factors when you're trying to write.

Designed to allow work to begin offline
　I must be able to create new notes offline, create multiple notes, and even if I close the browser as is, I must be able to open it again later and save it to the server.
　You can write in the note you have open now offline, it's automatically saved in the cloud when you go back online, but it disappears when you close or reload the browser.
　The note taker is requesting to be online.
　　So when I get the idea to write something on the go, I can't create a new note.
