　Some abstract solution A can solve some concrete problem X.
　This is self-evident if you know A
　But sometimes a surprising problem Y can be solved with A
　There exists a certain problem transformation B that maps some problems to others.
　　[maximum flow minimum cut theorem] or something like that.
　　This maps Y, which at first glance is not included in A, to Y', which is included in A.

What else could be in the problem conversion?
　Solving problems expressed as vectors by converting them to complex numbers [Vector Complex Conversion].
　[値域と定義域の交換]
　　Consider a set of numbers as a sequence of 0/1's and use [phoenix tree
　[Compress coordinates to a value within the computable range.
　DP a huge integer as a sequence of digits [digit DP].
　[Project Selection Problem]を[最小費用流]に帰着
　Viewing a number sequence problem as a [formal power series
　[双対線形計画問題]
