Documentation and education are different.
Based on [there are two types of elimination of genus], then is "maintaining documentation to eliminate genus" the former or the latter?

I think this is the former. Based on the [SECI model], maintaining documents is a process of making tacit knowledge in people [expressed].

To restore this knowledge to someone else's tacit state of knowledge again, someone else needs to take the time to learn it. The work of [internalization] is necessary.

To use it otherwise, for example, to create a situation in which "anyone can work while looking at this document," is not to train people who can do the same thing as the person who created the document. If you can do what is written in the document, you can do it. If something happens that is not written in the document, then nothing can be done.

The environment around a company changes. Documented procedures will eventually become obsolete and need to be updated. If we want to ensure the survival of our business, we need to nurture people who can do the same thing as "creating" the procedures, rather than having the people who created the procedures document the procedures.
