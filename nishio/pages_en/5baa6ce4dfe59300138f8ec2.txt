Close tasks when you are not motivated.
>When I don't have the motivation, I look for "issues that are finished but for some reason are not closed" or "issues that no longer need to be done" and close them, which contributes to my mental health by making me feel like I'm making progress even though I'm not actually doing anything.
>When there is nothing left to close, the next step is to create a smaller issue, saying, "This is too big an issue for me right now. ...... I'll make a smaller issue with saying "This is too big for me now ". This also contributes to [mental health], as you feel like you are working hard even though you are not actually doing anything.
