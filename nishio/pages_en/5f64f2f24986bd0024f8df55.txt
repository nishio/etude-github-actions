Thumb Shift Diary 2020-09
looking back
	[Diary of Thumb Shift on Mac 2020-01].
		I was able to use Japanese thumb shift input after practicing during my vacation in January.
		Programming would be nice if I could use two different shifts, and I modified Lacaille to achieve this, but I couldn't get used to this one.
		Lacaille is turned off when programming" -> troublesome
	If you don't use two different shifts when programming, wouldn't you rather stop using Lacaille and use Karabiner alone?
		Modified [generate_karabiner_conf] to support [shio shift
