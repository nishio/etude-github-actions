Cybozu
Cybozu is a software maker developing groupware. Groupware is software for use by multiple people group. Companies buy groupware because it improves the productivity of employees. I believe that groupware not only raises the productivity of simple work but also raises the productivity of work that produces knowledge. I think it important to enhance knowledge creation by software.
