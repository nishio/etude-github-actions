"AI will take our jobs" is a low job resolution.
Many of those who say "[AI] will take our jobs" have a [low] resolution of the word "[job]."

Some jobs are easy to automate with AI and others are difficult, and the easiest to automate will be replaced by the least easy to automate.

　Person A, who can use AI, will benefit from automation and get 5 results in 4 hours.
　For person B, who cannot use AI, 1/5 of his job is lost.

Whether or not it's an AI" isn't very essential.
　It just means that when a new tool is introduced, some people can learn that tool and some can't.
　Those who cannot master it will be at a disadvantage in the marketplace. This is a given.

What happens to Mr. B's job at this time is that he moves to Mr. A.

　　[AI is not taking jobs], people who learn are taking the jobs of those who don't.
　This work used to consume a lot of human time, so Mr. A couldn't do a lot of it.
　　[Automation] is "lowering the consumption of human time," so those who can automate will be able to do more work in the same amount of time.

　Good point. In that sense, Stable Diffusion running on a consumer PC that costs less than 200,000 is a historical epoch.
