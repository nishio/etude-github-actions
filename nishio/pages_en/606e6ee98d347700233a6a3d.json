âœ… Free response on/off

	[âœ…Create an empathic lighting mode.]
	ã€€After ðŸ¤”last message, no input accepted

ã€€Also returns "Is it ready to accept input?" as a response.
	ã€€It would be nice if we could make this false in certain states.
	I put it in the same place because I thought it was a variant of the mapping between state and action.

ã€€The current implementation stops not only free-response but also choice-type responses.
ã€€ã€€Let's modify that when it becomes necessary. We can control the choices, we just need to empty the choices.
