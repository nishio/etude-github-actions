　t=0 More "near distant" to existing relationships ([human network])
　　I think in general it's a higher dimension, but for illustration purposes, I'm lining it up in one dimension.
　t=1 First penguin A moves
　　Only those nearby observe it.
　t=2 Early adopter groups are created by those who observe and follow
　　Related [Movements are made by followers].
　t=3 Some of the observed people move and some do not.
　　Person B, who does not move, blocks the transmission of information so that people beyond him cannot observe his movement.
 t=4
