buddding/seedling
[budding]
	Adjective: Beginning to develop. 
	 He's a budding deejay.
[bud]
	A newly sprouted leaf or blossom that has not yet unfolded.
	 After a long, cold winter, the trees finally began to produce buds.
 (figuratively) Something that has begun to develop.
 	breast buds

[seedling]
	(botany) A young plant grown from seed.
	Any young plant, especially:
		one grown in a nursery for transplanting.
		a tree smaller than a sapling.

Hmmm, I think [seedling] is closer to what I had in mind with the word "[budding]".
ã€€BUD is definitely a new growth, but it includes new leaves and buds, so it has less of a "first born from seed" feel.
