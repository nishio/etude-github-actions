>I think it is much more difficult to spend a billion dollars than to earn a billion dollars, and I think it is much more difficult to withdraw from a business after deciding that it is no good and plunging a billion dollars than to spend a billion dollars. I think we should call this a venture.

>It is a good thing to be able to invest a billion dollars and cut your losses properly, but a bad company will think, "I invested a billion dollars, so I must be successful," and spread their wounds. There is no such thing as a "sure success" in a challenge with a high degree of uncertainty, such as developing a new market.

I wonder if it is more difficult to "spend a billion" than to "earn a billion."
This is somewhat ambiguous and depends on whether "making billions" means "creating a business that makes billions from zero" or "maintaining an existing system that makes billions".
Creating a business that makes a billion dollars from zero" is very difficult.
Maintaining an existing business that is making billions is a very different capability from "spending billions" or "creating a business."
When you try to get someone who has spent many years working for a company with an existing business that makes money and maintaining it to "spend a billion" or "build a business," it seems difficult because they have to do something completely different from what they have done before and experienced success with.
When considering the maintenance of existing business, they avoid uncertainty as a bad thing and try to reduce expenses.
When considering the creation of new business, we do not avoid uncertainty because if we avoid uncertainty, nothing new can be created, and if no investment is made to avoid spending, nothing is created, so we spend even if there is no prospect of return.
