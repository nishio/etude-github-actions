Pomodoro for 20 minutes
Crowdsourcing users have provided feedback that it is convenient for billing if 20 minutes is 1 [pomodoro]. In this case, 3 pomodoros would equal 1 hour, making it easier to calculate the number of hours worked per day.

The advantage of crowdsourcing is that it is easy to calculate labor hours as well, since it bills clients by the hour. This is a good example of modifying the methodology to suit the situation.

>(The technique traditionally uses 25-minute units, separated by short breaks. I use the Pomodoro technique and I find the 25-minute unit unwieldy. Here is what I do: I estimate how long a task should take, and then break that down into 20-minute units. Three such units add up to one hour, and this makes it easy to calculate my actual working hours at the end of the day, as 3 units equal one hour. It therefore doesn’t matter how long my breaks are [sometimes I need to pay attention to my daughter, or my cat is hungry, or my dogs need attention and my breaks are longer than the planned 5 or 10 minutes]. This means that the amount spent ‘at work’ is irrelevant, what is relevant is how much time was actually spent on a task.
> What I have noticed is that people are insecure about changing ‘prescriptions’ or ‘rules’. I think people should be encouraged to adjust the 25 minutes to either 20 minutes or 30 minutes – or stick to the 25-minute units if they wish, based on their own power of concentration and preferences, to make it easier to calculate, in ultimate units of hours, how much time they estimated, and how much time was actually spent. But this is just an additional thought.)
	>[nishio.icon]Your suggestion to make the unit to 20 or 30 minutes is also interesting. Encourage readers to adjust rules is good thing. I want to include the story as a column or merge into main story in future, but at this time I should translate the rest of sections first.
