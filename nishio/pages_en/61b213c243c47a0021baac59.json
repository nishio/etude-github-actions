Martin Heidegger
I looked up [Heidegger's] concept of [dwell], because it seemed relevant to what I wanted to think about.
	At least we know it's "Bauen Wohnen Denken".
	I finally figured out when it was made on the English Wikipedia. I wonder if a Japanese translation is available - I haven't found one so far.
	It was in this one, which apparently means it is short and not a stand-alone book: [What is technology?]
