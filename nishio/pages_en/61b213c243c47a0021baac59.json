Martin Heidegger
I looked up [Heidegger's] concept of [dwell], because it seemed relevant to what I wanted to think about.
	At least we know it's "Bauen Wohnen Denken".
	I finally figured out when it was made on the English Wikipedia. I wonder if a Japanese translation is available - I haven't found one so far.
	It was in this one, which apparently means it is short and not a stand-alone book: [What is technology?]

　　These words were later published in the 1959 essay collection Unterwegs zur Sprache and included in the 1971 English book Poetry, Language, Thought
			Shift from living (being) in the world to doing (time) in the world
				This aspect, especially the 1951 essay "[Building, Dwelling, Thinking]"
　Some people claim that there was no Kehre.
　　[nishio.icon]Well, it doesn't matter if it was or wasn't because it's a false dichotomy.
