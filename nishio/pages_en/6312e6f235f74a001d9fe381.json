mimic
This matter will be on an unbalanced memo for some time to come.

>[https://twitter.com/yitabashi/status/1565050321407442944?s=21&t=aCln3RGqmemjC2mUdwD5MA @yitabashi]: this sucks. ERNIE-ViLG was released on the mainland while mimic was beaten to silence domestically. And this is obviously learning a lot of pictures from Japan or pixiv (if you put pixiv in the spell, the quality goes up and becomes stable), what are you going to do about it? I don't know if it's still the case in the West, but the concept of copyright in the continent...

I don't want to live in such a world.
