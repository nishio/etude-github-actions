 - Implementing regular expressions in DFA makes it difficult to implement $1 and so on -> fatal
 -- awk is DFA, so there is no <ins>equivalent to Perl's </ins>$1<ins>.
 
 - CIFS over SSH

 - Tracking Table Tennis Balls
 - Fingertip movement is 90-100 km/h. It cannot be taken at 30 fps.
 - Recognizing the process of falling parts one by one that are blasted by the camera at 1000 fps.
 - Tracking elephant bugs moving at high speed
 
 - Using a slow camera (30 fps), complex calculations are required to fill in the missing information, which slows things down even more. If the performance of the camera is improved, a simple code can be used.

 -- "Isn't backreference more common with \1 than $1?"
 -- No, I'm not talking about backreferences, I'm talking about captcha, so $1 is fine. To quote the relevant part:
 >>
 Since the paths of state transitions in DFA do not uniquely correspond to the original regular expression, it is not easy to extract the information needed for capture from the state transitions in DFA.

 Since when did opening a computer in the Shinkansen become a common practice?

 No, no, no, no. You haven't got it yet. At least in the green car, all seats should have power outlets. Ha, or are you commenting on my having a computer open as a matter of course, looking at me with a cold eye and saying, "Since when did it become a matter of course to have a computer open? (thinking too much)
 
 *1199851377* game should be uninstalled
 In the days not so long ago, there were no games in the computer and you had to input your own games in order to play, but nowadays elementary and junior high school students are given a computer (probably a Windows machine) with Freecell and Minesweeper in it. So, when they are bored with the teacher's talk, they get into the habit of starting up Freecell. If you give a computer to a child, you could first uninstall all the pre-installed games and put Viscuit, Modulobe, or Nadeshiko instead. In the "games" section, of course.

 <body>The name two-finger loop detection may have been a lie. <br>In short, the algorithm is like this. <br>fast = slow = head;<br>length = 0;<br>while (fast) {<br> fast = fast->next;<br> if (!fast) return length + 1;<br> fast = fast->next;<br> slow = slow ->next;<br> if (fast == slow) loop_detected();<br> length += 2;<br>}<br>return length;</body>
