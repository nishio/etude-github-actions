A case study of abstraction in Scrapbox
I was writing about [Herzberg's two-factor theory], and "false dichotomy" and "false choice" were suggested when I wrote, "The naive idea that the opposite of satisfaction is dissatisfaction is [a false dichotomy]."

Since this case is clearly not a dichotomy or a two-way street, I created this [focus on the difference between similarities] page. â†’[incorrect 2].
