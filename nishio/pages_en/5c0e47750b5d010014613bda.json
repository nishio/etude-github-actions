The fallacy of seeking causes in the mind
 Fact: The divorce rate (number of divorces per 1,000 population) in Japan decreased by about 15% in the late 1980s.
 Why is this?

	I tend to give explanations that seek causes in the mind.
 In fact, divorce rates have been rising for all generations, and the baby boomers were just in the early 1980's with the highest divorce rates in the early 30's.
