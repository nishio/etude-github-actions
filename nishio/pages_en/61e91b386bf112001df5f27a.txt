rhetorical afterimage
Footnote for [(4.5.2.2) Make connections]

It was introduced in [The Rhetorical Afterimage] (Misuzu Shobo, 2000), and is mentioned in the [Lessons for Ideas] and [Serendipity from Random Reading]. I think that the memory of the previous sentence is stored in the [hippocampus] described in [(3.1.1) Hippocampus], and it is important that other sentences come in while it remains.
