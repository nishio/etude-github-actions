Nodal Point of Thought 2020-05-22
	People who come up with a lot of [ideas] value [ideas] less than those who can't come up with any ideas at all and finally come up with one. More emphasis is placed on the availability of [resources to execute] than on the idea itself.
	People with low interest in [business] or low bizdev skills are less accurate in estimating the [business value] of ideas.
	People who are not good at [communicating] with others, especially communicating their [vision] and [involving] others, think [on their own operating basis] when considering resources to implement their ideas.
	People who combine these three attributes will inevitably implement ideas that can be implemented in their own operation, not ideas with high business value.
	How can this situation be resolved?
	Think outside your viability constraints when considering ideas
	When evaluating ideas, don't judge them alone; listen to someone who is good at estimating business value
	But there's a problem: I can see a future where "ideas that have high business value but that I can't personally implement" are selected, and then people say, "I'm not [motivated] by this idea.
	Unless you have nothing else to do and you're bored, but if you have a myriad of ideas and they're juxtaposed with things you can execute on your own, you'll leave the ideas you can't advance alone and do the ones you can advance on your own.
	Is it ultimately a question of how [enthusiasm] is generated?
	In many cases, the skills for estimating the business value of an idea are not correct, and the estimation is not correct in the first place. and then, when the first shot is a dud, they lose motivation and start working on other ideas.
	The Power of Persistence
	It's a [trade-off between use and exploration] story, and it puts more emphasis on exploration.
