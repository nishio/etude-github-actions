The framework fixes the spatial arrangement
The [framework] of the [frame] filling system is accompanied by [questioning]. However, by answering the questions and filling the framework, the [spatial arrangement] based on "which question is the answer" is already made. I have a feeling that this is the root of all evil.

It's good to the point where answering the question makes what was not verbalized verbalized. But "what comes out" should not be top-down [categorized], but should be looked at as a whole and searched for something related, but filling in the framework prevents us from breaking it down because we get "something seemingly neat and tidy".
