Distinguish between tasks and TODOs
[A "Super" Introduction to Task Management to End "To-Do Hell"] distinguishes between Tasks and Todo.
The term is used in different books at different times, or even mixed up within a single book. (I worry about what my book is about).

[Task]: "Actions that can actually be taken."
	Task list is a list of actions
[TODO]: what to do
	Includes schedules and projects
	TODO lists may include things that are not tasks

Wife: "I feel like Task is bigger, Todo is more granular."
	Buying dinner" is a task, and "150 grams of pork" is a todo.
	That's the opposite of the definition in this book.
	A theory that probably depends on what the first tool you used was called.
	On the job, "tasks" are things that fall to you from other people, and TODO is what you bite into the actions you take.
	I agree with you that we need two lists with different granularity.
	I said, "What if it's a list of grainy actions and a list of projects that may contain more than one action?"
	Wife: "The project is a much larger 'housing management project.'"
	Everyone is different in this area in the end, so it seems to me that you should define and use what works best for you.
