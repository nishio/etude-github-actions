aPaaS
Application Platform as a Service

>The cloud computing services include (1) "traditional type" in which hardware is replaced by cloud infrastructure and applications are developed from scratch, (2) "PaaS" in which cloud services are introduced for infrastructure software such as databases and storage (external storage), and (3) "SaaS" in which applications provided as cloud services are used. (3) "SaaS," which uses applications provided as a cloud service - each has its advantages and disadvantages.
>In the past few years, aPaaS (Application Platform as a Service) has begun to attract attention as a cloud service that complements the shortcomings of each type of provision. aPaaS is a form of cloud service in which all layers, from hardware to business applications, are entrusted to a cloud service provider. In the case of SaaS, all layers from hardware to business applications are entrusted to cloud service providers, whereas in the case of aPaaS, only the business application part is developed and operated by the user.
