Maximize logarithmic expectation
The story is that maximizing [log expected value] rather than log [expected value maximization] is the right thing to do in a [compound interest] environment.
The implicit assumption is that it is a baccarat that can be tried over and over again an infinite number of times, and going bankrupt in the process means losing all investment opportunities from that point onward, so the opportunity loss is negative and infinite.
On the other hand, the condition of being able to repeat the challenge an infinite number of times is impossible for people with a limited lifespan, so realistically, it would require an investment above the Kelly standard.

I'm running a simulation at the beginning of this article.

This simulation has 10,000 trials, so even if we assume one trial per day, that's about 30 years.
If your total assets are 10 million yen, it is optimal to put 50,000 yen in a baccarat every day.
Of course, unlike this simulation, the real-life baccarat has no known expected value or win rate.

 Talking about how the option that maximizes expectations is not the optimal choice.
	I'm connecting it to [prospect theory] from there.
