They free them from every fear of ignorance, and they worry for them the fundamental points of every difficulty. It is a rare greatness to make use of the wise, far surpassing the barbarous taste of Tigranes, who was fond of taking captive monarchs as servants. To skillfully make servants of those who are essentially our masters is a novel kind of supremacy, the best that life can offer. To know is great, but to live is difficult: without knowledge there can be no real life. There is an amazing wisdom in studying without learning, in acquiring many things by many means, and in becoming wise through them all. You then speak in a chamber for many, and the same number of wise men speak through your mouth as were consulted beforehand. Thus you gain the fame of an oracle through the labors of others. The spirit of such a messenger distills the best books and provides the quintessence of wisdom. But he who cannot serve a sage should have a sage for his friend.
