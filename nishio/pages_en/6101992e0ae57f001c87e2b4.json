I'll copy and paste the version as of 2021-07-29 and run it.

That's right, fix to absolute paths.

I missed that there are two scripts.

[/nishio/nisbot.icon]What kind of "test" is that "test"?
Whoa, now I can talk to Keicho on Scrapbox!
[/nishio/nisbot.icon]その「Keicho」は、どんな「Keicho」ですか？

As already written in [/takker/UserScript to chat with Keicho], "I want to send answers without making selections / with one button or one keystroke."
　I don't have to make a selection to access the entire page content.
　How about creating something like `[ask_keicho.icon]`, and using a hotkey to enter the non-empty line before the icon, and inserting the answer before the icon?
　code:1
　 Test (cursor)[ask_keicho.icon].
	code:2
　 test
　 [nisbot.icon]What kind of "test" is that "test"?
　 (カーソル)[ask_keicho.icon]
	code:2
　 test
　 [nisbot.icon]What kind of "test" is that "test"?
　 Next sentence (cursor)[ask_keicho.icon].

　Would you rather this be "the line with the cursor"?
　　Image of hotkey becoming "ask me a question line break".
　Right now Keicho has a chat-like UI that looks human and behaves in a tightly coupled "only put a quote when asking a question in a sentence other than the one immediately preceding it", but you can always include the input text in the response.
　　Then the UserScript side can look at it and decide where to insert it...?
　　　I'm still trying to figure out how the asynchronous text in Scrapbox works.
　　Ah, you're using a textarea inserted at the cursor position, then I can only write at the user's cursor position.
　　This is going to be difficult because of Scrapbox's philosophy of not providing an API for programs to write to arbitrary locations, so the user will have to move it themselves.

　line containing the cursor
　　Wow, Textarea is floating with position: absolute?
		XPath
			`$x("//span[@class='text' and contains(.,'[ask_keicho.icon]')]").slice(-1)[0].innerText`
			`"\t\n Why don't you create something like [ask_keicho.icon] separately from [nisbot.icon], use the hotkey to take the non-empty line before that icon as input, and insert the answer before the icon."`
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate
		`document.evaluate("//span[@class='text' and contains(.,'[ask_keicho.icon]')]", document).iterateNext().innerText`
It's an icon, so can't you get it with this? → False.
	`document.querySelector("span.text img[alt='ask_keicho']").parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.innerText`
	Incorrect: When the cursor is in front of the icon, the line is in edit mode, so it is text.

　　Oops...
　　Keicho's specification that interprets keywords enclosed in square brackets as explicit keywords.
　　So let's just call it `(keicho)` then.
[test]
It's done.
