Knowledge Accumulation Model
	[the principle that a learning curve is an S-curve] made simpler.
	Stacking boxes
	When a box is given, if its placement is fully supported, it has probability 1 to place that box.
	If the placement is supported on one side, the box can be placed with a probability of 0.5
	In this case, you can stack the boxes by giving them in order from the bottom
	But what if it is not probability 1?

	The probability of reaching the apex is very low if you just give the boxes in order from the bottom.
	what to do about it
		convey repeatedly
		Make sure they understand and tell them if they don't.

This diagram is simplified, so the top box is in a form that depends only on the two bottom boxes
	It actually depends on a lot more boxes, and it doesn't have to have all the boxes to support it.
