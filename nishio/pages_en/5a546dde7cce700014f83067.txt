Don't classify, array.
>In handling [idea] memos, it is important to remember the words of Tadao Umesao, "Don't [classify], [arrange]".

[The Art of Intellectual Production] p.57 "[Classification is not the goal]"
　The context is an explanation of how to use [information cards].
　summary
　　Some people care about "how it's classified."
　　This is a mistake based on the misconception that cards are for classifying and storing knowledge.
　　Cards as tools of intellectual production are not like that.
　　　The goal is not to classify and store knowledge,
　　　Manipulating cards to perform intellectual production tasks is the use of cards.
　　　The ability to operate the card is a feature of the card, if you only want to store it, you can use a notebook.
　　What is manipulation?
　　　rearrangement and rearrangement
　　　This often uncovers connections between seemingly unrelated cards.
　　　　By discovering [nishio.icon][unexpected associations] you are [a posteriori structured] into a structure you did not anticipate in advance.
　　　Cards are tools of creation
　　To decide on a taxonomy is to set a box for thinking.
　　　Put the card in a tight classification system and it will suffocate and die.
　　　Classify according to subjective interest, not according to objective content of knowledge
relevance
　Knowledge written in notebooks is often dead.
　　[not a warehouse where dead text is placed].
　　[fish tank metaphor].
