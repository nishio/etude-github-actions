 If the encoding of the terminal is utf-8 and Ruby 1.9, you can try this.

 irb(main):044:0> puts %|\x1b$B$"$"$"|.force_encoding('iso-2022-jp').encode('utf-8')
 Uh-oh
 => nil

 In Python, there are two types of strings: byte strings and Unicode strings. In the Python example on p157, the byte string '\x1b$B$"$"$"' is "converted to a Unicode string by decode('iso-2022-jp')", and then print" converts it to the terminal's default encoding (UTF-8 since it was a Mac) and outputs it.
 
 In Ruby, on the other hand, strings are designed as "byte strings + encoding information", so at the initial %|\x1b$B$"$"$"| stage, it is determined from the terminal encoding that "this string is utf-8". Then, force_encoding('iso-2022-jp') tells us "No, it is not utf-8, but iso-2022-jp". However, if this is put, the iso-2022-jp byte string will be sent to the terminal as is and will be corrupted, so it is converted to the same encoding as the terminal by encoding('utf-8') again.
