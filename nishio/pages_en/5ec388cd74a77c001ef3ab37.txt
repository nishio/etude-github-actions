There is no boundary.
　No [boundaries].
　There are not always boundaries.
　Just because there is a boundary in the direction of one [axis] does not mean that there is a boundary in the direction of another axis
　In the chronological process of A, B, C, D, the part of B and C is a phase called X. I circled only B and C in red as shown on the left
　But this figure implicitly assumes that "E and F are not X".
　Is that assumption correct?

　Just because there is a clear boundary in the [time axis] direction does not mean that there is also a clear boundary in the [spatial axis] direction.
