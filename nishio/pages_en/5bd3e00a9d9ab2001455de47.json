Hearing of dissatisfaction with Scrapbox
	Digging into the wife's statement about wanting to "[organize]"
 	[nishio.icon]Scrapbox has a place to "[let the chaos speak]," and it seems to be uncomfortable for those who want to eliminate that [chaos].
		What is this "organizing"?
	I want to [get the big picture].
	 Different from [classification].
	 Not that I want to be classified.
  Sometimes classification is used in the process of understanding the big picture, but the goal is not classification, but rather the big picture.
  	[Getting the big picture is not classification].
 To get the big picture is to know "what kind of things there are and how much of them there are.
 	[Know your portions]
 I want to [divide into areas].
 Not classification [physical placement].
 Anything that can't be classified as either a book or a toy should be somewhere in the middle.
 	If you put it in the book section, above the toys, that's all you need to do.
  	[nishio.icon][bat problem] arises because of [crisp] classification, not because we shouldn't
	I don't want to [label], I want to [associate with place] #place
 It's a [tidy] up image.
 	In [nishio.icon][KJ method], you want to go from a situation where you have a bunch of stickies lined up to a situation where they're a little bit [grouped].
 		The current [Scrapbox] has stickies lined up, but I can't do anything from there.
	A mind that is not troubled, but restless, [isui], exactly [azumashii nai].
 	[nishio.icon]Customers don't understand what's at stake.
 Not inconvenient.
 I don't have trouble getting things out.
	I don't need to know exactly where everything is, but "where did that go?" but if you can remember "that area," you will be more motivated.
  [nishio.icon]Shrink the scope of what you're looking for.
  It's "somewhere in this room," and that's not motivating.
 [I understand that there is a great need for that for physical objects, but in the case of electronic data, you can narrow the scope by doing [searches], so why not?
	Similar to the difference between an electronic dictionary and a paper dictionary, [the map] is updated by looking at what's around you in the process of searching for what you want.
		Electronic dictionaries are direct and only give you what you want.
  If you just want to get to what you're looking for, it's faster that way.
  I want to [update map
	[nishio.icon]Doing a search means that a list of things that contain a certain keyword will appear, so things in the vicinity should be in view in the sense that they "contain a common keyword" of some sort, right?
 	Are you saying that just the fact that it contains keywords is too inaccurate?
	Large variation
 Dictionaries are organized.
 	[nishio.icon]The format is in place.
  The [nishio.icon] dictionary could be organized because the target is one type of information: "word meanings.
 Search results are too unconnected.
 I don't know where to put what I see.
 	[nishio.icon]There is a large cognitive burden in putting search results on the map.
	The ones with the greatest [cognitive burden] are thrown away.
	[nishio.icon]The problem is that the search results page is cluttered.
 If it's "Here's a list of all the red things in this house," there's too much information to map, so you have to squint and throw it away.

	I want to decide what is important to me.
	'I want to make it easier to focus on what's important to me at that moment.'
 	[nishio.icon]What kind of things are important depends on the time.
		So we need to prepare [information design] to make it easier to focus at that time.

search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)
	[Consulge]
	[RECOMMENDATIONS]

	[arrangement and location].
