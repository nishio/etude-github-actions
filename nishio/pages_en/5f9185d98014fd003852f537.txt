　Thoughts.
　　Small numbers should be placed on the vertex with the smallest possible order of magnitude.
　　Small numbers should be placed near small numbers as much as possible.
　　If only we could prove it.
　　　It's a tree, so there are lots of dots with rank 1.
　　　Putting the smallest number x at a point of rank 1, one side is x
　　　There is no way to get 0 edges to be x.
　　　So it is best to place it on a point of rank one.
　　Just sort and place them in order of smallest to largest.
　Official Explanation
　　You're telling a very different story.
　　Method of placing the larger pieces first to solidify them.
　　I think the result is the same as my method of placing the smaller numbers from the end, since I place them from the larger ones while keeping the collection of larger numbers connected.
　　The principle is [not to create enclaves].
　　On my part, [fill in from the end].
　　It says you can check all the edges and O(N^2) will get you there in time, but it's probably O(N) with depth-first search.
　　　My method, which is to start from the point with rank 1, is a depth-first search in the order of return multiplication.
