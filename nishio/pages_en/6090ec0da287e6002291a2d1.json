 word2vec is simply explained as a tool to convert words into vectors. The default setting projects words into a 400-dimensional real vector space. Wow, a vector space!
 
 If you throw a three-word query, "man king woman," it will look for the word closest to king - man + woman in vector space and answer "queen.
 
 Given three points in vector space, a plane passing through them can be determined, and if we project to that plane, we can visualize in two dimensions. Wow, visualization!

 Hmmm, I was hoping for a distribution around the upper right corner. Actually, word2vec's word-analogy normalizes all the vectors in doing the "find the word closest to king - man + woman". So each word is distributed on the hypersphere, and king - man + woman is generally not on the sphere. Therefore, the normalization is applied to king - man + woman and they are dropped on the sphere. Therefore, even if we project the distribution onto the plane stretched by the king - man and woman - man axes, it will look like a mess, as if we were looking at the distribution on the sphere from the side.

 If you zoom in on just the candidates, it looks like this. The red circle is the point on the sphere closest to king - man + woman, so the first-place queens don't look particularly close. Well, it means that the points closer to the red circle than the queen in this figure are further away from the red circle than the queen in directions other than these two axes.
