 I dried it yesterday morning but it's not dry (because it was raining?).
 
 My chest hurts again. I didn't do any strenuous exercise (I did take a bath), but it's still racing like an early bell. I wonder what is wrong with me. Oh no, is this love?

 At any rate, it seems that mecab-config is not included in the Windows version, although I have called mecab-config --version to identify the version number.
 I guess I'm supposed to build from source.
 
 It became tedious, so I stopped.
