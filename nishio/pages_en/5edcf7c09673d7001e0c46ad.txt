Prototypes and Proposals
	If the purpose of creating a [prototype] is well articulated, when there are "things that are easy to implement but not very useful for the purpose" and "things that are difficult to implement but absolutely necessary for the purpose," the latter can be chosen. If the [objective] is unclear, you will only do the former.
	When I said "it is better to have a prototype" regarding the [unexplored junior] proposal, I did not mean "make a prototype *before* writing the [proposal]". Making a proposal is the process of putting into words "what would make me happy about doing this project". The proposal makes the prototype better, and vice versa.
	Therefore, I think it is better to make a proposal in a rough form [bullet points], make a prototype based on it, and then [improve] the proposal based on the [experience] of working with the prototype, and gradually improve it while rotating in a small cycle. [Like a spiral staircase, going in circles and climbing higher and higher.
