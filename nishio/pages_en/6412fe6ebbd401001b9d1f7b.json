What is "[Clean Language as a Board Game]?"

[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[/nishio/human.icon] I'd like to verbalize a little more about "clean language as a board game".
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "clean language" is that "clean language"?
[/nishio/human.icon]The original Clean Language was people talking to people. We've made that a reality in the form of chatbots, using ChatGPT to make the conversation natural, but I feel we've moved away from value. In fact, I think it is more appropriate to view it as a "board game" rather than a "conversation," which is what I realized last time.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Anything else about that "clean language"?
[/nishio/human.icon]When I say board game, I'm speaking figuratively, not making a literal board game.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "board game" is that "board game"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Now we have a UI that looks like a chat screen with a metaphor for dialogue, but if it's a board game, the information should be presented so that humans don't have to remember it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Anything else about that "board game"?
[/nishio/human.icon] "Status" and "degree of achievement of goals" and "approaching goals" need to be visualized in an easy-to-understand manner.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What "degree of achievement" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]I think it is important to "gain awareness" and "decide on the next action", and since the latter is only one of them, I think it is better to set the latter as the final goal. However, I feel that there are cases where the Next Action does not need to be decided, so it is a question of what to do
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "latter" is that "latter"?
[/nishio/human.icon]"Language of Next Action" I feel like this should be a one-shot deal once it's accomplished. I think this should be cleared as a one-time achievement, because it is better to move on to the implementation of the action without continuing the chat. I think "awareness" should be cleared when 3 points are earned.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "Next Action" is that "Next Action"?
[/nishio/human.icon]To decide what to do next.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "what next" is that "what next"?
[/nishio/human.icon]When you are bothered and unable to verbalize and worry, it is like standing still in a fog, but if you stand still, the scenery will not change and you will continue in the same state. What you do next is not essentially important, but what is important is that you feel like doing something and move forward.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you value?
[/nishio/human.icon]To have your worries resolved and lead to action.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "action" is that "action"?
[/nishio/human.icon]It doesn't matter what it is. It is important that he/she is willing to do it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What is that "feeling"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Enthusiasm? A state of heightened motivation.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "enthusiasm" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]Image like energy for action
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about that "action"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Actions lead to results, you feel negative about criticizing without acting.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where is that "action"?
[/nishio/human.icon]人の中から出てくる
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > Action leads to results, I feel negative about critiquing without action.
 Where does this "action" come from?
[/nishio/human.icon]When the goal is blurred, you can't see it, but when it's clear, it comes out, it separates from the blurred goal and takes shape.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "goal" is that "goal"?
[/nishio/human.icon]What I want to achieve in my life
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > Action leads to results, I feel negative about critiquing without action.
 How do you know this "behavior"?
[/nishio/human.icon]I can tell if I am acting. We can't observe what others are doing because it's often not public. It's called "trial and error is hard to see." So you have to take many times more actions than others appear to be taking to get the same amount of action.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where is that "action"?

 What does this "behavior" look like?
[/nishio/human.icon]Actions do not correspond one-to-one to rewards. This is because actions do not always lead to results. So if you expect a reward, you lose motivation when the action is not rewarded. I imagined a lottery or a gacha, but it's not quite the same. Even if you don't win the lottery, you need to feel satisfaction when you take the action. I wonder what it is. Jelly beans?
[/nishio/kei.icon]What would you like to see happen regarding that "action"?
[/nishio/human.icon]If you're from a state where you don't see the action, you better see it. If you can see the action, you better be enthusiastic about doing it.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Anything else about that "enthusiasm"?
[/nishio/human.icon](This conversation doesn't seem to be leading to Next Action.
[/nishio/human.icon]要約して
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 The original Clean Language was for conversation, realized in the form of chatbots
 Realized as a board game rather than a dialogue, visualization of information is important.
 "Becoming aware" is cleared by earning 3 points, with one Next Action as the final goal.
 It is important to feel like doing something and moving forward. We need to see action and do as little as possible.
 Behavior does not have a one-to-one correspondence to reward, but must be satisfying at the time it is acted upon
 Jelly beans?"
 What to do next is blurred and invisible, but once the action is taken and the goal is clear, we think about it.
 Next Action: Start by taking action

[/nishio/human.icon](Yes, GPT can't find the next action in the current situation.
[/nishio/human.icon]情報の可視化に関して掘り下げよう。
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "visualization" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]The appearance of the metaphor is approaching awareness. I haven't visualized it yet this time, but it would be nice to visualize the degree of development for each keyword. I haven't noticed it because I haven't visualized it, but it might help improve the algorithm. It might be better to visualize the score for each keyword as well.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about that "visualization"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Simply making it visible will help debugging and improvement. As for general user use, it's confusing to have so many mysteriously visible, so it needs to be hidden. It would be nice if it could be turned on or off in the developer options.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where is that "visualization"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Not yet. It's too small to put on a phone screen. On a phone, it's a tab, on a PC, it's side-by-side, maybe.

In fact, I think it is more appropriate to view it as a "board game" rather than a "conversation," which is what I realized last time.
 Where is this "clean language"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Where the clean language element is in the visualization is two things, the stack of stories and the development of keywords. I've done this before in coaching with human counterparts, but I've never visualized it mechanically in a chat log in Keichobot. I'll do it manually first, then figure out how to do a mechanical visualization. This is a Next Action.
[/nishio/kei.icon]How do you know its "clean language"?
[/nishio/human.icon]要約して
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 Realize that clean language as a board game might be feasible.
 He realized that it is important to encourage action.
 Direct alignment of goals and rewards is not important; rather, enjoyment and satisfaction must be found in the action itself.
 Information visualization on the chatbot is under consideration. The stack of utterances and the degree of keyword development are considered key factors.
 After manual visualization, mechanical methods need to be considered.
 Next actions are manual implementation of visualization and consideration of mechanization methods.
[/nishio/human.icon](OK

[nishio.icon]This is a very deep mechanical stack here.

　　The latter = "Next Action Linguistics."
　　Next Action" = "What's Next?"
　A little more shallow because there is a mere paraphrase of the
　It's a good move to cut below when you get lost in these depth-first strays.
　Actually, it would be better if we could select keywords to prevent the stack from getting too deep.
　No, as for "next action" in depth, it's a keyword that's in an earlier stage, so this is a shallow stack with "visualize as a child of the first stage".

[*** Keyword development level].
	[https://gyazo.com/3c56d2dff2388b54ef38ff8bbf2ed5a9]
　I've visually connected the stickies on each line of the summary to the most relevant parts of the summary, but it's too hard, so you can determine the similarity mechanically.
　　Or, "The summary is not written by the user, so we filter it."
　I feel like it should be the development level of the keyword and the value you read, or more simply "the number of statements that contain that keyword".
　　This corresponds to "Kozane with many lines connected" on Kozaneba

If you ignore the timeline and organize it, it looks like this
[https://gyazo.com/33621418203b47a3de3df5c5fe19f6cb]
　It was the "visualization" section above that contributed to finding the Next Action, but it was the "action" section that expanded the conversation when we were chatting.
　　This, in essence, makes the "distant goal" clear.
　　On the other hand, deciding on Next Action is the next step "near goal".
