 *1216740580*[RTM]Remember The Milk on cell phone
 Remember The Milk The fastest way to register tasks from your phone - Forgot the Milk. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/hmiyaza1/20070223/1172866709
 Register a task from your cell phone with reference to the
 
 
 I see that RTM has "an e-mail address for creating tasks with details" and "an e-mail address for creating many tasks at once". I didn't read it properly and sent it to the former e-mail address that I had registered in the form phone book before, so I ended up with a task without a title that was written in a memo full of notes.
 
 
 Try to keep your inbox empty, as described in the linked blog. I dare to say rigidly, "Repeat as often as possible the task of organizing and emptying your inbox, a task that is both urgent and important."
 
 
 However, some of them were shoved into Inbox at random, so I'm not sure how to classify them. The granularity of classification is also troubling. Household chores and event preparations are mixed in the "personal" list. And GoogleCodeJam is in the "study" list even though it is an event. Hmmm, should I divide them into two categories: chores that I can decide when to do, and events that other people are involved in? This is not something I should be worrying about. I'm going to leave it as it is for now and fix it if problems arise.
 
 *1216741559*[RTM] Deadline Driven
 Tomorrow is the recycling day, and since RTM had registered today as the deadline, I put out the cardboard boxes that I hadn't put out before.

 Even if there is no harm in not doing the task on that day, I dare to set a deadline. If there is no deadline, there is no harm in not doing the task today, so we tend to put it off. If there is a deadline, I have to edit the task in RTM and set the deadline to the next garbage day, which is a hassle. It's a very trivial thing to do, but it's a wonder that I can take out the trash with it.
 I was able to remember to take in the laundry I forgot to take in this morning because I registered the task on the train on the way to the office. If you think you have very few clothes, you may have left them hanging out to dry for 5 days, so thank you RememberTheMilk. I wonder if I can lead a more fulfilling life if I use it more.
