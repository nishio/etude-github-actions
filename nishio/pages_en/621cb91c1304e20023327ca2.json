Plus Action Conclave
Draw, the bad guy's hideout.
uncompressed
Purchase Acquisition Dark Agents
Special Victory Points None

I wonder if I should do a stero.
　First hand, dark, silver coins.
　　I was going to get a silver coin with the fool's lucky coin...
　　The effect of acquiring the dark man has gold coins in it, so why not skip the victory point with the night watchman instead of the silver coins?
　　I've never used a fool before, so I could use one, but I'm not sure if it would be useful after getting lost, or this.
　The dark man, 5 gold. Hideout of the bad guys. Ready to use?
　Dark man, 6 gold, night attack. Is this the gold that attacks?
　4 gold. So both the conclave and the poet are silver coins with extras. I'd go with the poet because there are so many night cards and so little action to begin with.
　4 gold. Or increase it because the opponent shoots the dark man.
　9Kin, Province
　omission
　　Not fast enough.
　　The gentry are four pieces each, the difference between the gazetted territories.
　　You have four dark men, so that's a lot of gold.

rematch
　Night Watchman, Dark Watchman
　〜tilde
　tie

rematch
　5When I had the money, I bought a relentless dark man.
　More money by carrying over coins in the barn.
　victory

1 loss

rematch
　First move, transportation transport to obtain deportation.
　Destroy the mansion by forced eviction and discard the traveler's cottage and three cards.
　defeat

AI is a sanctuary, forced evictions, large numbers of cats.
　Hmmm... surely forced evictions can't compress them?

rematch
　First move, forced eviction with transport (will buy sanctuary with next 5 gold).
　Exile the mansion and discard 3 cards at the inn.
　3 gold for transportation, banishment of sanctuary
　Gain sanctuary in transportation
　Forced evictions and accidents in the sanctuary, three horses used, but no brigands came, expelled from the mansion and brigands.
　　Oh, wait, the sanctuary is a cantrip.
　~Exile the states of the genus and gold coins
　Pulled off, 15 gold and forcibly evicted. Expelled gold and gentry, 12 gold and gentry, and a brigandage.
　Tear off, forced eviction, sanctuary, 17 gold. Forced eviction, gold to the province. Draw and expel that genus in sanctuary, 14 gold for the genus and gold coin. Return gold coins from the expulsion mat.
　You won the gentry by forced eviction, and the gentry by 9 gold...you're already dead...39:24 for the win.

Renaissance, many cards I don't know.
Border Patrol, Two Choice Cantrip, with extras
Tracker, +2 cards, +2 villagers when earned
Experiment, 2 horses for 3 gold?
Flag bearers, when acquired or discarded, get a flag
Flag: +1 draw on cleanup
Priest +2 coins 1 discard, +2 coins if card is discarded
Oh, Project Sewer, can be additionally discarded when the card is discarded.
But without the draw, we're going to run out of things to discard.
Scepter +2 coins or re-use of cards left on the field
Scholar Discard hand and draw 7
Sculptor Gains a card of cost 4 or less in hand, +1 villager if it is a treasure.
　In other words, a card that gets you silver coins and villagers.
Swordsman +3 draw +1 coffers if discarded, 4 coffers gain a treasure chest.
Treasure chest: gold coins at the start of the purchase phase
Treasurer +3 coins, "Destroy 1 treasure," "Gain a treasure in the discard pile to hand," "Gain a key (= +1 coin at start of turn)"

Priest, compress in sewer. Buy a sculptor for 5 gold to generate silver coins and actions because there will be nothing to throw away because purchases will not increase.
　If more purchases are made, maybe we could buy border guards or followers and dispose of them.
　Abandon the mansion at the priest, destroy more in the sewers, buy a flagman for 4 gold and get a flag.
　Sculptor with 5 gold
　2 discarded in the priest's sewer, 4 gold. Subtle~. Silver coins
　Sculptor gets a silver coin in hand, 7 gold for a gold coin? Canal? Let's make it a canal.
　Earn silver coins at the sculptor, buy gold coins
　Throw away two cards at the priest for 5 gold... gold.
　provincia
　provincia
　Province, Duchy

Theater Company Disposable + 4 Villagers
Mountain village Village that can be taken from a discarded card.
Spices 2 coins 1 purchased, 2 financial resources when earned

Mountain villages, followers, spices, but no disposal
I'd consider a swordsman as a blacksmith, maybe a stero.
　First hand, silver coins silver coins
　silver coin
　6 Gold, Gold Coin
　7 Gold, gold coins
　5 Gold, Swordsman
　6 Gold, Gold Coin
　4Kin, Yamamura
　Swordsman, 10 gold, genus state
　Pulled a swordsman in a mountain village and played, 9 gold for a genus state.
　8 gold for the province
　Yamamura for 4 gold
　Turn 13, lost.
　 The opponent bought the fifth piece of the genus state at 21:36.
　 Is this too late, or should I have bought a swordsman instead of a gold coin for 6 gold?
　Undo
　　No, it's getting late.
　　The other guy is crazy fast.
　　Is it strong enough to have a Treasurer x2 with a key and a flag?

rematch
　5-2, so the Treasurer and the Pursuer.
Hmmm, still can't win.
The other guy's got the flag and key again...

I've noticed myself to the point where the Treasurer is a gold coin that can be bought for 5 coins and can destroy the copper coin if the action accident doesn't happen.

rematch
　When we take the flag after the fact, they immediately take it back...

rematch
　We were down by three, but...

rematch
　not winning at all

I've been trying for about a week and I'm starting to feel the group of cards.
　Village or blacksmith type.
　It's like, "Oh, Wild Hunt is a blacksmith who gets victory points."

I also noticed that the card effects are closed by element, but they are always arranged in the following order: draw, action, purchase, coins, and so on, so if the surrounding area is open, it's a hint.

There's a tremendous amount of village stuff.

And then there's the compression system, which is not included in the basic 4 axes.
https://wikiwiki.jp/dominiondeck/一覧/圧縮

The four conditions of the combo are plus action, draw, compression, and acquisition.
It does not match the four basic functions written on the card: draw, plus action, plus purchase, plus coins.

Acquisition consumes an action to obtain a card.
Purchases are made by spending purchase rights and coins to obtain cards.
Discard reduces the number of cards.
