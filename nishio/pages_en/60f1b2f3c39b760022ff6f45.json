In 2021, "Where's that book? It wasn't cut and scanned, was it?" And I looked for it.
　I had taken pictures of the contents so I could identify which box it was in.

I've never taken it out, so this is my first time taking it out.
　It says something to the effect of signing up at 1:00 on Saturday and getting it Sunday morning, do you think I'll get it?
　And by the way, I ordered a new box.

Arrived on schedule.
　The people who brought empty boxes were not the same as those who brought boxes of books.

The box that holds the books (book kit) has a double bottom to withstand the weight.

　Last time I only bought a book kit, but this time I also bought a regular box, this one is a regular cardboard box and I have to use duct tape to fasten it.

　Maybe I should have just used the book kit?

　　I like that I can close my mouth without having to use duct tape.
　　　The lid can be temporarily closed to prevent dust and cats from entering, even when the contents are not yet finalized.

I can sign up for a pickup at 5am on Monday morning and they can bring it to me on the fastest Monday 8-10pm flight.
　I decided to have them take three boxes anyway.
