The St. Petersburg Paradox
[Birth of the concept of "utility

>The St. Petersburg paradox is one of the paradoxes in [decision theory]. It is a paradox that arises when [expected value] diverges in cases where a very large profit can be obtained with a very small probability.

>In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli, who lived in St. Petersburg, published in his article "A New Theory on [the measurement of] Risk" in the journal "Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Petersburg". The purpose was to show that classical "[fairness]" by means of expected values was not always applicable in reality, and to develop a new theory of "utility" (Latin: emolumentum).
	Some say it's [Nicholas Bernoulli, son of Nicholas], and I'm a little unsure of the facts.

>[Bernoulli] avoided this paradox by defining "[utility]," which could be called [subjective value].

>This is the same idea as [diminishing marginal utility] in current economics.

> Bernoulli further stated that utility is the logarithm of the amount of money.
>The utility obtained by the logarithmic function is called "[logarithmic functional utility].
>The utility of an increase in assets is inversely proportional to the total amount of assets
	>This is called "Bernoulli's rule".

>No matter how gradual the increase in utility, if the prize amount is set so that "utility doubles" for each backstop, the expected value of utility will still diverge.
> To prevent this completely, we need to consider that utility has an upper limit. In other words, once a certain amount is exceeded, utility basically cannot increase any further. The upper limit of utility means the state in which all desires that money can buy are satisfied, and this is called the "[bliss level].

[d'Alembert] "The assumption that the game can go on indefinitely cannot be real." [It can go on indefinitely].
