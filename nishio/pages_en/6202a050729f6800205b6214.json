Food Court Parable
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490883997723131907]: I was reviewing project proposals for next year's [unexplored junior], and I'm starting to feel that it's difficult to fully convey what we want to say just by the questions in the proposal. I'm starting to feel that it's difficult to convey what we want to say with just the questions in the proposal. I think we need a separate document...

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490884724285648904]: just to add to the confusion, this is not a test, so it is not a "there is an assumed or model solution and if you write it you pass" type of thing, Not at all.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490886904782663685]: A proposal itself is a "product" and there is no "right" answer. What determines whether a product is good or bad is whether there are "customers" in the "market" who will respond to the product. Since customers have diverse values, each person reacts differently to the same product.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490891014181376004]: it's similar to coming to a food court for the first time and seeing a bunch of food places and having to choose one of them. The menu does not match the food. But the customer looks at the menu and chooses a dish. If the pictures on the menu look faded and unappealing, the probability of being chosen decreases.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490892093312880640]: They try to convey attractiveness not only through the appearance of the pictures, but also in various ways, for example, by conveying to customers the aroma and sizzling sound of roasting meat, offering sample tastings, and so on. The customer is not only interested in ordering all the food that looks good, but also in the food that looks good. Customers do not order everything that looks good, but only the amount they can eat, depending on how hungry they are.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490896522124627969]: For example, when you put mayonnaise on sashimi, some people think "Why did you put mayonnaise on the sashimi? Sashimi with mayonnaise? It looks interesting. It depends on each person. However, as to why mayonnaise was poured on the sashimi, I think it's better than "because we were out of soy sauce" or "because it was written in a manga that mayonnaise tastes good".

>nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490897073214193672]: "When I actually made it and tried it, it was delicious, so I changed the mayonnaise type and blended it in my own way to create an even more delicious recipe. That's why I recommend this sashimi mayonnaise!" It is easier for people to be motivated to try mayonnaise if they are told, "I actually made this mayonnaise and it was delicious.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490898147627126784]: And this is something that only people who have actually tried it can talk about, not "people who used mayonnaise because they were out of soy sauce". Therefore, talking about it is a factor that differentiates one from "those who have not tried it. But if you don't talk about it, it's a waste of time.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1490898927918682118]: Not only in this case, but often after hearing about it in an interview, I comment, "You should have written that in your proposal, what a waste," so perhaps I'm sure there must be people who are missing out on advancing to the interview because they didn't write it in the proposal, and I think that's a waste of time.
