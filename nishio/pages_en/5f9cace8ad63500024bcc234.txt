 The problem of aligning to one color at the first cost of each excess of 3 separately.
 Three independent problems? I thought so, but it's tricky that the aligned results should not be the same color.
 　If we check the three smallest costs for each of them, we can search for the smallest from the 27 streets in the entire search.
 After dividing into three, the squares are just under 10^5 and the colors are 30
 　I wonder if it would be better to ask for the cost of each color foolishly.
 Official Explanation
 　30 x 29 x 28 streets > 10^5 squares for 10^4, and when I check the 10^9 squares for 10^4, I can't make it.
 　Count the number of pieces of each color in each of the three blocks in the preprocessing
 　My method is pre-processing to find the cost of aligning each color in each of the three blocks, the order of calculation is the same.
