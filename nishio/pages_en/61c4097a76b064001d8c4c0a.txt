Value is not based on productivity
I was thinking of the statement, "Your [value] is not based on your [productivity]."

Well, value as an existential being is not based on productivity because it is based on being existential. I agree with you there.

On the other hand, from the [supremacy of civilizational progress] perspective, since humans are parts for civilization, value is based on their contribution to civilization. It is not based on the productivity of money or goods in general, but it is based on the productivity of the contribution to civilization.

In that light, the first claim has low resolution for both "value" and "productivity".
