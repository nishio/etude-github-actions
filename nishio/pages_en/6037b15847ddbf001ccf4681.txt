I can't see the back and bottom of the [1x4 curved slope leg Tachikoma] carriage at all.

Even if you want to make it retractable, other Tachikomas are not helpful.
The [1 x 4 Tile Leg Tachikoma] has the Lego studs facing up, while the Curved Slope Leg Tachikoma has them facing both sides.

Then I thought, "Should I give up on opening and closing the door and just close it properly? I thought about it, but that would be too much freedom and I would not be able to make a decision. What should I do? I think I'll just close it symmetrically with the visible side...

I was tinkering with the structure and unexpectedly created a structure that could open and close.

The lamp holder and horizontal clips grip and articulate the bar.
ã€€I would like to correct the color.


Hmmm, both sides of this door would open up a gap.

Oh, maybe this is the right thing to do?

Now I just need to figure out how to close the bottom... there's a convenient gap, so maybe I can insert a bracket here...
