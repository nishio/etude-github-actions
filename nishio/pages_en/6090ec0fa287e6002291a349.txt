 *1463124382* Cashier: "That's 972 yen" Customer pays. Cashier: "Here is 104 yen back!"
 
 I am eating a 972 yen lunch at a restaurant in a business district. I can hear the cashier talking to me.
 
 
 Cashier: "That's 972 yen."
 Cashier: "Here's 104 yen back for you!"
 
 
 ...... Eh, what happened?
 
 
 ** Exercises
 
 After thinking about it for a while, I came up with a story that could work without either the customer or the cashier handing over the wrong coin or an extra coin that did not need to be handed over. It was quite interesting to think about this, so I decided to write a blog post about it. (Allowing for mistakes, there is another solution)
 
 ** Hints
 
 Let's follow my thought process and get closer to the answer step by step.
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 
 I said, "If 100 yen is returned as change, it must mean that the customer did not pay 100 yen coins."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "If a customer were to pay 1,000 yen, the change would be 28 yen."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "In order for a customer to receive 104 yen in change, he needs to pay 1076 yen. 76 yen requires a 1 yen coin, and this is not right because a 1 yen coin is returned in change."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "Suppose a customer had paid out 1,500 yen, and they would get 528 yen back. This is also strange."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "The cashier said it was 972 yen, but what was actually paid was not 972 yen, was it?"
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "For that to happen in this situation..."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "The lunch I'm having now is also 972 yen.
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "Looking around, I see some people like me eating alone and some eating with more than one person."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "If several people eat a 972 yen lunch and go to the cash register, the cashier may say 'per person' 972 yen, and the customers may pay different amounts for several people at once.
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "If I pay for two people and give 2,000 yen, the change is 56 yen; for three people, 84 yen; for four people, 112 yen.
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "The actual change was 104 yen."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "Four people would be over, and two people would be 48 yen short."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 I said, "Three people are 20 yen short."
 
 ：
 ：
 ：
 
 ** Answers
 
 I said, "Well, here's the thing."
 
 
 A customer or three heads to the cash register.
 Cashier: "(Per person) 972 yen."
 Customer pays 3,020 yen.
 Reg, I see that and understand that it is for three people.
 Cashier: "Your change is 104 yen."
 
 
 Even if the customer's ability to memorize is poor, it won't matter because the cashier has a calculator.
 
 
 Cashier: "(Per person) 972 yen."
 Customer takes out 3,000 yen.
 The cashier, seeing it, understands that it is for three people and enters three people into the calculator.
 The calculator shows 2,916 yen.
 The customer, seeing this, adds two more 10-yen coins from his wallet.
 Enter 3,020 yen as the cashier and amount to be received.
 The calculator shows 104 yen.
 Cashier: "Your change is 104 yen."
 
 
 ** another solution
 
 When allowing for coin errors, there is another solution: "A customer wanted to pay 1072 yen for change to make 100 yen, but mistook a 5 yen coin for a 1 yen coin, resulting in a payment of 1076 yen and a change of 104 yen. The customer paid 1076 yen, and the change was 104 yen. The interpretation is that "4 yen" is the difference between 1 yen and 5 yen.

 <body>Even if you don't have the wrong coin, if you have only one 1 yen coin in your wallet and a 5 yen coin, <br>you may well intentionally take out a 5 yen coin because a 1071 coin will not give you 100 yen in change. </body>
