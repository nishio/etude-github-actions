The title is copied and pasted on the last line, but it's not bracketed.
Bracketing First

I've connected pages that seem to be quite relevant.
[https://gyazo.com/793a8cb6f2f25468bb5314a7a83675e1]

Almost the same content (same date written, and both are based on this sticky).
[https://gyazo.com/2f43ac920db7c303a6ed3047f879aa5e]

The chronological order would be "write a sticky note," "note it as an example of writing in a skimmer," and "write a story about writing, with thoughts developing from there."

More emphasis on the distinctive features when comparing these two pages
	writing (e.g. as a profession)
 It's not done at a desk.

I felt like ticking off a very long sentence in the text.

A few more corrections
[https://gyazo.com/2faf59d67df5345c9e76c6790b5b1c8c]

I was convinced. Look at the other page.

Bracketing for now.
I found a page that looks interesting, but I'll look at this one later.

I'm done bracketing.

Other than minor wording corrections, nothing special.
But when I made that minor correction, a chain of events occurred that led to the discovery of another correction.

The "Recommendation for Derailment" that was withheld earlier was found to be an empty page and referred to in Shigehiko Toyama's "Hints for Intellectual Creation". I shall assign the tag "derailment."

I could start reading this book here, but I have other things to do today, so I'll just tag along.
