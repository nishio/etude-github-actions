Their place
	Adding [custom emojis] to chat tools is a process of introducing "their favorite toy" and making it "their playground".
	Tools that don't do that don't give a sense of "[our place]".
	If we don't feel like it's our place, we don't feel like visiting or maintaining it from time to time.
	I think [metaverse] and the like will go out of business if users can't [customize] it easily, because they don't feel like it's their place.

[Sense of self-possession].
