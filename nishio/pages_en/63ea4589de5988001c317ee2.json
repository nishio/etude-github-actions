Hypothesis that SSR emission rates are higher for gachas involving other people.
Something that is "[uncertain]," something whose outcome "cannot be predicted in advance."
 He likens the act of "doing it" in life to "[pulling] a gacha."
 [Planned contingency] says, "You'd better get messed up.
　So what kind of mess is best? then what kind of gacha is best?

Even shadow game gachas are "uncertain" and "unpredictable.
　Hypothesis that emerged
　　SSR emission rates are higher for gachas involving other people.
　another approach
　　Even in the best case scenario, the upper limit for a shadow gacha is not much.
　　　Even if you drew all SSRs in a 10-round gacha, so what?
　　Very small considering the impact it has on our lives.
　　[Upside risk] I guess.
