   I saw this and associated it with [Imposter Syndrome], but I still can't verbalize why I associated it[/villagepump/nishio.icon].

 The relationship between being an idiot and asking questions and Imposter Syndrome.
 　[Imposter Syndrome]: Thinks he's held in high esteem.
 　People who can't be assholes and ask questions: afraid of being devalued.
 　If people with Imposter Syndrome really think that the problem is that they are held in high regard, then they can be assholes and ask questions to solve the problem.
 　Why not?
 　Is there another problem that is not visible on the surface?
 　Example
 　　You think less of yourself.
 　　But he fears that those around him will think less of him.
 　　So do your best and do activities that will get you praise.
 　　People around you praise and appreciate you.
 　　However, he/she feels that it is not his/her true self.
 　　　The [masks], the [papier-mâché tigers], that kind of thing, that I worked so hard to create.
 　　　Getting praise for it doesn't relieve my anxiety.
 　　　[I'm afraid of being disillusioned, afraid of being thought of as a fraud.
			Convincing, ["[overly humble]"] may have something to do with the same nuance[/villagepump/yosider.icon]][/villagepump/inajob.icon].

	I saw the term [expectation control] somewhere.
		[/nishio/expectation-control].
			[/nishio/not to raise exaggerated expectations].
				If your expectations are higher, you may be disillusioned later.
		seem relevant
			[/nishio/ You don't have to use your power in front of all people].
				Conceal the limits of your abilities
				I realize I'm doing this strategically, but I feel guilty inside.
			[/nishio/never exaggerate].
				I'm afraid of losing credibility with stupid questions.
	I sometimes think of myself as [broadening the range of characters], is this [expectation axis control]?
	[I'm not sure where I stand in the community#6375b129774b1700006e5097]
		> I feel like I'm changing my behavior based on my own deviation in that field in the community[/villagepump/inajob.icon].
			Oh, I'm going in circles with this process [I'm going to ask a lot of stupid questions -]!
	Imposter Syndrome is the feeling that the other person's evaluation of you is off on the right track with respect to expectations and axes of expectation.
		To eliminate this [expectation control], [expectation axis control].
			Rarely a match, so must be meticulously maintained.
			If you try to control it but can't control it as intended, this becomes a problem.
			Do you feel like you want to lower your expectations, but not too low?
			 A sudden drop would be shocking and scary, so there is a desire for a gradual drop[/villagepump/yosider.icon].
			  [Downward load on evaluation]
			I don't want to [disappoint][/villagepump/yosider.icon].
    As expectations increase, the risk of betrayal increases [expectation control].
　　　　I think there is a difference here [nishio.icon].
　　　　phenomenon
　Assume a situation where Mr. A expects Mr. B to
　　　　　'Mr. A subjectively expected Mr. B to perform.'
　　　　　Mr. B's actual performance was smaller than that."
　　　　I don't feel this phenomenon is a "betrayal" in the first place.
　　　　Mr. B need not be responsible for Mr. A's subjectivity.
　　　　If Mr. B intentionally gives out information in a way that misleads Mr. A's judgment, Mr. B will be held responsible.
　　　　　So, "[t]he list of things I've done as observational facts is this. Whether you rate it high or low is your business, not mine]."
				If Mr. A had verbalized his performance expectations to Mr. B in advance and Mr. B had informed Mr. A that he could achieve them
　　　　　I think this case is the equivalent of "betrayal."
