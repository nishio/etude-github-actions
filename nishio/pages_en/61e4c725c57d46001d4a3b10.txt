Venture's positive arguments are manifold.
[Metaphor example]
>A positive argument for a venture is a manifold. Locally, a good argument can be made. For example, "culture matters".
> However, since the company is rapidly scaling, culture and correctness are constantly changing, so there is no such thing as a "long-lived" correct theory.
