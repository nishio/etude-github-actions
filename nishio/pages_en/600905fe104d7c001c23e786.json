FIXED: Menu does not close in Material-UI
Because `<Menu>` was included in the `<IconButton>`, after the MenuItem is clicked to close the menu, the click event is propagated and the menu is opened again.

It could be stopPropagation, but I decided that it is not supposed to put `<Menu>` inside of `<IconButton>` in the first place, so I put them in `<>.... </>`.

[Material-UI]
