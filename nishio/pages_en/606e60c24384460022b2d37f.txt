A is X is not good.
When people talk about "it's not good that A is X," they are implicitly saying "it's not good that B is X, too." implicitly interprets this as "it is not good that A is X 'unlike B'".
On the other hand, there are those who interpret "it's not good that A is X" as "it's not good that 'A or B' is X, regardless of whether it's A or B".
