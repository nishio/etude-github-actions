POLOLU-2459
[Photo reflector]
It can be read by RasPi without ADC because of digital output, but instead of watching ON/OFF by GPIO voltage, it is used to measure the time from outputting HI to reading and then back to LO.

 Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high.
 Allow at least 10 Î¼s for the sensor output to rise.
 Make the I/O line an input (high impedance).
 Measure the time for the voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low.

	It might be a good idea to use it on an Arduino with a set of libraries put out by the manufacturer.
	I thought, "It's a digital output, so even a RasPi without an ADC will work!" but it's a pain in the ass!

It's usable in one way or another [https://gist.github.com/nishio/8dd862a127b0d8045d23aac90c9c9b27 source code].
