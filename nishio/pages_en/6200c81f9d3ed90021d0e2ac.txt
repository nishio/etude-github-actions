(7.2.3.3) To strive for excellence
In order to connect knowledge to value, we need to aim to become the person most familiar with that knowledge field. This state is called "[excellence]". As for excellence, there may be many people who have an image that "as a result of growing, eventually become excellence". But that is not the case. First of all, become excellence, thereby getting opportunities for growth. (*15)

Nonetheless, for example, you may think that it is impossible to become top if you look at the difference between your seniors and your knowledge. Therefore, the differentiation strategy is introduced next. 
The complete overlap of knowledge with that of the seniors is the reason why you are in second place. So, make a conscious effort to shift the field. You don't have to beat your seniors in the areas they are good at. All you need to do is to become more knowledgeable than your seniors in the areas where they are not so good.

This is the reverse of the idea that you can learn even from people with little knowledge in in [(6.3.4) You can learn from anyone]. Even if the absolute amount of your knowledge is small, if you differentiate it, you can become a position to teach others.

This is where [fulfillment] and [confidence] come from." in his book "The Condition of the Professional". (NOTICE: It is the Japanese-translation book, I didn't determine the name of original)
