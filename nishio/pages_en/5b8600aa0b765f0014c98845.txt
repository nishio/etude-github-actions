Nodal Point of Thought 8/29/2018
	Do you know what the KJ method was first used for?
 Many people think it is [Jiro Kawakita's] "idea method," but it is "[party science]" that was first written in a book
 So it doesn't matter what the title is when you first publish it.
 	It can be "[technology supporting coding]."
 [Good ideas inspire those around them to start growing on their own].
	Methods introduced in party studies took on a life of their own.
 	They didn't give a name to the method, so it was called the KJ method.
  	[Why not name the method?]
 After the fact, "Explain it" led to the writing of the "Idea Act.
 	I'm not sure anyone would suddenly start writing "ideas" without any.
  Technology that is [always incomplete] and in the process of trial and error for the person concerned.
  ã€€A "write now" request takes a [snapshot] of the current moment.
  	making finite
  What is obvious to the person in question is not verbalized unless they are asked to explain it because it is not obvious
			[natural technology].
	[Ideas are not born complete from the start.]
		Books are not created in isolation.
  The ease of attracting attention by being recorded as a snapshot and distributed commercially
  Until the concept of [permalinks] was born, bibliographic information was used as permalinks
  existence that can be referred to
  There is a network behind the book that has produced it.
 Ideas as a growing, child-bearing entity
	If books are a system of finitization, we should help readers connect to the infinite network behind them.
 If books are produced by [crystallization of knowledge], shouldn't they provide access to the fluidized knowledge that is behind them?
 	That access has traditionally been in the form of discussions in academia or something like that, it's just hard to keep track of.
  Electronicization [transcends time and place].

	What is [nodal point of thought]?
 	A place where many keywords can be connected.
