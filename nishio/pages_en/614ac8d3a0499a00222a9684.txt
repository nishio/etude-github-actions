Webpack Compilation Error in Cypress

  File was processed with these loaders: ...
　This is due to the fact that the explicitly imported ts file imported another tsx file, and Cypress was not configured in the loader to read tsx.
　Should I set up a loader?
　　In this case, it was not a good idea to have utility function definitions that do not require DOM creation in a single tsx file, so we fixed that.
