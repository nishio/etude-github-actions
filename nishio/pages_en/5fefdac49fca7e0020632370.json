rice cakes made from leaped rice
Ddeokbokki, which I recently fell in love with, is "made mainly from kaletteok (가래떡), a stick-shaped fresh rice cake made from leaped rice."
Suama, which I have always liked, is "made by kneading [koshinko] in hot water, steaming it, adding sugar, and then pounding it up while it's still hot.
I realized that the mochi I like is not actually sticky glutinous rice.

Ddeokbokki Karetteok
　Wash, pre-cook in boiling water for 2 minutes and fry
　Boiled in boiling water for 3 minutes and it was ready.
　I want to make it easily in the microwave.
　　Put in deep water and microwave for 2-3 minutes
　　If I made a mistake and did it just enough to soak it, I lost water and it became harder instead.
　　Tends to harden when time is short
　　I thought I would be able to make my own tteokbokki in ozoni, so I put it in water at random and microwaved it, but the water was too little and I got inedible hard sticks. The ones boiled in boiling water for 3 minutes could be eaten normally, but the ones that turned into hard sticks after one failed attempt could not be eaten even after boiling.
