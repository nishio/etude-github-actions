Multiple Movement Issues
		Lasso selection of 200 stickies and moving them around takes time for the screen to refresh
			It's because the code for moving one sticky is being used all over the place, and it's causing 200 status updates to run.
		Undo to go back one by one as you are moving individual stickies.
			Undoable from the ground up to make the state Undoable, but it was not designed properly
		　Instead of "each state update should be subject to Undo", it should be "each user operation should be subject to Undo".
		　I thought "Undo is hard" with the image of old GUI implementation, but not so much.
		　If you follow the React Way of "no destructive updates to state," you can easily get back to a "state at a point in time" by simply keeping a reference to the state at that point in time.
