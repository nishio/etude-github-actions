 「[$ X \subset Y]」[X⊂Y]

  From thinking of X and Y implicitly as dots to thinking of them as sets

 	It's not as if there is a bias that X is [an individual thing].
  In general, X is not limited to individual objects.
  	For example, "An integer is a rational number.
  	[*/ Every] integer is a rational-number.
   The is-a relation, which assumes that X is an individual, does not fit when a set comes to X, so it is converted to an individual with Every.
   Other conversions such as X is a [*/ kind of] Y. are also seen.
