The place to write it down is not on a task list.
It is better to post the task items on the task list, because this is the place where you can scribble them down without thinking about how easy it will be to read them later.
Maybe if you did some long term statistics on the percentage of tasks out of the ones you've written down, you'd be able to notice any hiccups.
