Footnote: other metaphors for taking the top of pyramid
Another metaphor: Suppose you want cherry blossoms. If you get a flower blooming branch, flowers get scattered soon. If you want flowers every year, you need the trunk and roots. A similar metaphor: even if you give fish to hungry people, you stop hungering for only one day. So you should teach how to get fish instead of giving fish.
