The "I raised you" type delusion.
Delusions older men tend to fall into.

Requirements are multiple
	[Hot air balloon parable]

Mistaking a contribution to one of them for "raising" them.
	Only a small percentage of the total.
	by not seeing the whole picture.

This is especially true for men who have left most of the child-rearing labor to their wives, who are full-time housewives.
Not seeing the big picture of the task of "nurturing."

It had only a marginal impact.
