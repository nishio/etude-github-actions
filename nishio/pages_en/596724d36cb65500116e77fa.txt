Specific Examples of Knowledge Interference
	>An appeal against examiner's decision of refusal may be filed by {{c3::Patent applicant::Who}} within {{c2::3 months}} from the date of service of the transcript of {{c1::Decision of refusal}}.
	>When must a revocation action against a trial decision be filed? The action must be filed within {{c1::30 days}} from {{c2::30 days}} of the date of service of the transcript of the trial decision.
The two were created separately, but I noticed interference when I looked at what was extracted as a card with a high error count.

In short, let me get this straight.
	>An appeal against Decision of Refusal is requested within {{c2::3 months}} from the date of service of the transcript of Decision of Refusal,
	>A suit for revocation of the trial decision shall be filed within {{c2::30 days}} from the date of service of the transcript of the trial decision.
 This difference is key.
