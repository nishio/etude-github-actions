Even if both are correct, there are discrepancies in the scope of observation.

Both people call a certain thing A, and it is A for both of them, but what they imagine between them is different.

Neither person knows "everything that is called A in the world. [the range of observation] is narrow.
With respect to what you are pointing at, "Is this A?" yields the result "is it A". So we both think that our "calling it A" is correct.

Both are creating an equal cause of miscommunication by narrowing the scope of observation, yet the person on the right feels like he or she knows A better.
