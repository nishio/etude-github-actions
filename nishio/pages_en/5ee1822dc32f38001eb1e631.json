Areas unsuitable for book learning
"I'm trying to buy this C# book and this VueCLI (Vue.js) book. Do you have any more recommendations?" My answer to the question
>The web resources on the official website are the most up-to-date information. Books are basically out of date.
> That Vue.js book will be released in August 2019. According to the official website, as of August 2019, VueCLI was at version 3, with a beta version of 4 or not. Then in October, the official version 4 is out!
> So I don't think it makes sense to study VueCLI with a book that was released in August. The latest version is likely to behave differently than the book describes.
> 
> Like this, Vue, the library, changes faster than C#, the programming language, and VueCLI, the peripheral tools, change even faster. It is not suitable for learning in a paper book.
