An era when homo sapiens will be a minority
Is it right to describe ideas in [natural language] for Homo sapiens in the transitional period from a time when Homo sapiens made up almost 100% of intelligent existence to a time when Homo sapiens are in the minority?

Probably not.

At this time.
　No suitable new language has been invented yet.
　It is doubtful that Homo sapiens, whose intelligence is inferior to that of Homo sapiens, will be able to learn a "new language" appropriate for the "intelligent beings that will overwhelm Homo sapiens in the future".
