Sticky note locations are multidimensional vectors
The position of a sticky note is basically a multidimensional vector
　We tend to think of it as "two-dimensional," but it is a mapping of multidimensional vectors to two dimensions.
　This way you can solve the problem of automatic layout: "Manual placement is an intellectual product and I don't want it to be overwritten by automatic generation.
　　We can do automatic layout in the immediate subspace.
　Difference from having multiple views
　　Can interpolate arbitrarily between views
