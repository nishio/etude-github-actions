Not understanding correctly.
Note that I realized that the Japanese phrase "not understanding correctly" can be interpreted in two ways.

That Mr. A. doesn't understand correctly."
	The set of "things" x such that f(x), which "A correctly understands" about x, is False.
		That Mr. A does not understand correctly.
		A set of things that Mr. A does not understand correctly
	The fact that f(x) = False for some "thing" x
		That Mr. A does not understand correctly.
		That Mr. A does not understand it correctly.
