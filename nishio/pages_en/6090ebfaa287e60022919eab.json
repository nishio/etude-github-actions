 I was concerned about the fact that fluorescent lamps are susceptible to flickering, but I heard that they can flash 40,000 times. If you go to the bathroom 10 times a day, that's more than 10 years. The life span is about 12 times longer, so if the incandescent bulbs used to burn out in 4 months, they will last 4 years. Also, you can choose reddish or greenish color.

 For a second I thought it was cracked.
 
 I tried turning it on. It seems to turn on with a "yosho" after the light is turned on, which is about a 0.5 to 1 second delay. But it's not that harmful and it's not too dark.
 
 I also looked at electric kettles later and decided to buy a T-fal stainless steel one.
