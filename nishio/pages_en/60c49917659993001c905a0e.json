Movement extends the range of observation

	derived from [how do you know what your options in life are?]

>[tkgshn https://twitter.com/tkgshn/status/1390344021344587778]: this is very abstract, it's like [move]/difference as various physical and community concepts!

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403330777878732801]: i was thinking about this and it developed a bit. [why is "movement" important]. The human [range of observation] is limited, we can't see well in the distance, we can't notice things outside of our limits. [Movement is an opportunity to see things that were previously unseen], and one of the useful tools to answer the original question, "[How do we know what the options are]?" twitter.com/tkgshn/status/...

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403331710398341125]: The strikingly observed "I saw someone else close to me doing it," "I learned from a distant friend," and "I learned from a mentor close to me" are seemingly disparate Although they may seem disparate, they are opportunities to "broaden one's perspective" through "[someone] who saw something that I didn't see. I think these two are the main pillars (although there may be others).

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403332801080954884]: First, be aware that your range of observation is limited and think about how you can expand it. Some people are lucky enough to have expanded it passively, others actively.
>In both cases, the first step is not always a big jump, more often than not people seem to

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403336192217677829]: some people said they "didn't have any" in response to "[life choices]". Of course [choices are not given equally], so there may be people who really didn't have any.
> But more than that, like assuming that choices are "given" and not actively taking action to obtain them,

> The case in which a person chose only "options with clear (and small) value" over "[options with unclear value]" because he/she thought that [the future value of the options] could be known at the time of choice, and as a result, the person only achieved below-average performance when compared to others (like the [cash deposit trap]).
　#Mistaken belief that future value can be known in advance #Planned contingency #Uncertainty

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1403337807108599811]: There's also the "[the grass is greener on the other side]" effect, where people underestimate the value of what they've already got, so that even though they're making choices and benefiting from them, what they didn't get seems bigger than what they really got. I've already made a choice and benefited from it, but what I didn't get seems bigger than it is.
