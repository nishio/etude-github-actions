 *1275924293* I made a PONG-like game on my iPad that can be controlled by figures.
 I tried to give a practical demonstration of how <a href="http://www.nishiohirokazu.org/muroto/">Muroto</a> can be used to make a game that uses a figure as a controller. Why are the operations in the latter part of the demo on an iPhone so slow? One reason is that I was holding my iPhone 3GS with one hand while demonstrating with an iPhone 3G with the other hand, so I couldn't move it too fast. As you can see in the first half of the demo, the real-time game on the iPad seems to be able to run at about 30 FPS even if you move the game around.

 >>
 If socialism is defined as the ownership of the means of production by workers, then the United States is the first true socialist nation in history. (omission) Only the U.S. has realized true socialism in the sense that the workers, the source of value in Marxian economics, own the fruits of their productive activities. The U.S. realized the socialization of its economy unintentionally and without nationalization.
 
 In less than a year, four times as many pension funds had been created in the U.S. as had been established in the previous 100 years. In less than a year, four times as many pension funds had been created in the United States in the previous 100 years, and all of them employed the most radical innovations of all GM's pension funds. <b>GM's pension funds were a kind of mutual fund. </b>

 In the same way that the dichotomy of "value passing" or "reference passing" saw a dialectical resolution of "reference passing," I wonder if the dichotomy of capitalism or socialism will also see a dialectical resolution of "ownership of capital by workers.
