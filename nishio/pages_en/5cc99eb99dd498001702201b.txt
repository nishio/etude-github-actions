Most people are less active information gatherers.
So most people underestimate those who do not disseminate information.
They are relatively [overestimated] just by transmitting information.

This is a defect of the "human" system currently in operation, and it should be quickly replaced with an improved version. On the other hand, that replacement timing will probably not come in my lifetime, so I need to design my life on the assumption that the current system will continue to operate for some time.

I was not sure of the connection between "most people are less active in gathering information" and "so most people underestimate those who don't disseminate information," so I took it apart.

	Most people are less active information gatherers.
	When those people judge others, the weight of passively received information becomes heavier.
		Evaluate by "the amount of information transmitted," not "the amount of information a person is capable of transmitting.
	People who transmit less information are underestimated.
		Even if a person has the ability to transmit information, it is evaluated by the amount of information actually transmitted.

â†’Then it was concluded that it was a difference in interpretation of the words [active and passive].
