a small-minded person being idle (tends to do evil)
>Do not deceive yourself, do not be deceptive, do not be evil, do not be good-natured, this is called self-abnegation, therefore, the sovereign must be careful! The little man is not good at leisure, he is not good at all, he sees nothing good, he is not good at all, he is not good at all. What is the benefit of seeing yourself as you see yourself? This is called sincerity within, form without, and therefore the sovereign must be careful. Zeng Zi says: "Ten eyes to see, ten hands to finger, and it is terrible! Wealth is abundant in the house, wealth is abundant in the body, the mind is broad and the body is large, therefore the sovereign must be sincere in his intentions.

The part about "the little man who lives in idleness and does evil" is well known, but what I'm trying to say in this paragraph is repeated twice, "Kimiko must try to do his own thing."
　A prince refrains from doing good even when he is alone, while a dwarf does evil."
　As a letter, it certainly means "daytime," but I'm not sure if it's a "leave me alone" kind of nuance.
