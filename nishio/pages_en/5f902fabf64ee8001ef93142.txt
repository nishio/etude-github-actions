　Thoughts.
　　I think we can get it to a draw (that's not what they asked).
　　Let's call the excess number of goos a charge.
　　If you don't have a charge, you have to play goo.
　　　At this time, the charge is 1.
　　When there is a charge, you can choose your hand.
　　When the opponent plays par and thereafter only plays goo
　　　If you make a goo, -1 point, +1 charge
　　　　Unless the charge exceeds the number of goo of the opponent, all pars are played and points are scored for the charge.
　　　Draw with par.
　　　　Gain one less charge point.
　　　Therefore, it is always better to make par
　　So you should charge so that you can par when your opponent pars.
　　Check the amount you can use because overcharging is a loss because you can't use it all.
　　　And by usable quantity, I mean the number of words left.
　　When the opponent plays par, you play par; when the opponent plays goo, you play goo; and when the charge equals the number of letters remaining, you play all the remaining pars and use them up.
　　If the opponent doesn't do the stupid thing of making an extra charge, the point difference becomes zero and the game is a draw, which is what I was vaguely thinking when I wrote the first line.
　Official Explanation
　　First think about what happens if you make all goo, then think about what happens when you change one spot to par.
　　　Since the score increases regardless of the opponent's hand at this time, we conclude that it is better to make as many pars as possible.
　　　Alternate and keep the charge small.
　consideration
　　I think the strategy is different between "use up the charge before the end" and "don't let the charge build up," but the result is the same.
