[D - Binomial Coefficient is Fun https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc110/tasks/arc110_d]
　When Bi is less than Ai, the binomial coefficient is zero
　So there is no need to consider cases where Bi is small.
　[$ B_i = A_i + D_i]. [$ D_i \ge 0]
　[$ S := \sum A_i] and the rest as [$ R:= M - S
　[$ \sum D_i \le R].
 It takes the form of "distribute R (or less) balls in N frames."
 Consider distributing just K balls in 2 frames for simplicity
	(0, K), (1, K-1), ... , (K, 0), there is a way to distribute
	The solution X2 we want is [$ X_2 = \sum_{i=0}^K \binom{A_1 + i}{A_1}\binom{A_2 + K - i}{A_2} ]
　There is a way to implement this naively and obtain it for some values and predict the answer formula from them (I did so), but in this page, I will do it by transforming the formula.
　From the symmetry of the binomial coefficients [$ \binom{A_1 + i}{A_1} = \binom{A_1 + i}{i}]
 [$ X_2 = \sum_{i=0}^K \binom{A_1 + i}{i}\binom{A_2 + K - i}{K - i} ]
	[duplicate combinations]: Number of ways to select k out of n, allowing for duplicates
 	[$ H^n_k = \binom{n + k - 1}{k}]
	Write in the form of duplicate combinations:.
		[$ X_2 = \sum_{i=0}^K H^{A_1+1}_i H^{A_2+1}_{K-i} ]
	Duplicate combinations of A1+1 to i and A2+1 to K-i contents of sigma to choose from
	Adding up for all possible i's results in K duplicate combinations to choose from A1+A2+2.
		[$ X_2 = H^{A_1+A_2+2}_K ]
　Return to binomial coefficient form
	　[$ X_2 = \binom{A_1 + A_2 + K + 1}{K}]
　So far, the answer for distributing exactly K with N=2 can be expressed in terms of a single binomial coefficient
　Next, consider N over 3.
　　Rename variable K to i
　　 [$ X_2 = \binom{A_1 + A_2 + i + 1}{i}]
　　At this point, X at N=3 becomes
　　	[$ X_3 = \sum_i \binom{A_1 + A_2 + i + 1}{i} \binom{A_3 + K - i}{K - i}]
		This is just A1 becoming A1+A2+1, so the argument above can be used as is.
			[$ X_3 = \binom{A_1 + A_2 + 1 + A_3 + K + 1}{K} = \binom{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + K + 3 - 1}{K}]
　At general N:.
		[$ X_N = \binom{S + K + N - 1}{K} ]
		This was just the solution when they were handing out K pieces.
		The answer X that the problem is asking for is the sum of everything below R
			[$ X = \sum_{K=0}^R \binom{S + K + N - 1}{K}]
 [Field hockey stick identity]::
 	[$ \sum_{i=0}^k \binom{n+i}{i} = \binom{n+k+1}{k} ]
	Field hockey stick identity to find the sum
		[$ X = \sum_{K=0}^R \binom{S + K + N - 1}{K} = \sum_{K=0}^R \binom{S + N - 1 + K}{K} = \binom{S + N - 1 + R + 1}{R} = \binom{S + N + R}{R} ]
	From the symmetry of the binomial coefficients
		[$ X = \binom{S + N + R}{R} = \binom{S + N + R}{S + N}]
	[$ R:= M - S], so
		[$ X = \binom{S + N + R}{S + N} = \binom{N + M}{S + N} ]
　Now the values to be sought are combined into a single binomial coefficient.
　N+M will be about 10^9, but S+N will not be 10^7, so if properly implemented, it will be in time.
