(5.1.1.2) Let's practice
Well, let's put the book aside and [practice] the ["to write all out" method] for 5 minutes. 
If you have to write a report, choose it as the theme. If you do not have goals, use the theme "if you tell others about this book, what do you tell?"

 Prepare your favorite stationery to write.
 Set the timer to 5 minutes.
 Press the start button of the timer.
 Concentrate on the theme for 5 minutes.

[If you have sufficient information in your mind, you feel 5 minutes very short. Most of time passes during you are writing.

On the other hand, if you do not have enough information in yourself, you feel 5 minutes very long.

In the workshop I did (*), each participants was able to write 80 to 100 pieces in 16 minutes. So, on average we can write at a pace of 5 pieces per minute. That is 12 seconds per piece. Please do not feel this as pressure, and please play like a game aiming for high-score.

Note *3: This is a workshop held at [Kyoto University Summer Design School] in 2013 and 2014. On the theme of designing your way of learning, we spent 12 hours in 3 days for lectures, the practice of "to write all out" method, and then organize the pieces with [KJ method] to make a presentation.
