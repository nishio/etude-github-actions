	Long ago [Is the Learning Ladder Model Right?] I wrote in
		Some people have a mental model that there are superior and inferior people.
			I called it the "ladder model" because it is lined up one-dimensionally like a ladder.
	I saw this tweet and thought [culture fit] was a good description.
		This word was not in my dictionary.
		[Matching], a concept similar to "like-minded, unlike-minded".
		But there are still a good number of people who think in terms of a one-dimensional ladder model, whether it's job hunting or marriage activity.
			'I am superior and should be well liked/employed.'
			This kind of thinking itself is the cause of bad outcomes.
