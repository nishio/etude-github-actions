	>I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but I interpret the title "Unexplored Junior" to mean roughly that it is an event to find "other dimensional kids". If you are looking for that much at the application stage, as the first person said, I don't think you will find a real "different-dimensional child". In the end, it will feel like the "kids with little smart parents" whose parents have the ability to produce will stand out.
　If you interpret "kids with little smart parents" as "cases where the parents have a lot of help with the paperwork," then I don't think those will make it to the adoption process. They can't explain the project in their own words or answer questions from the PM in real time during the interview after going through the paperwork.
　>I think it's hard to convince both the ones who failed and the ones who were adopted that adoption is, frankly, a matter of luck.

　I too think the title is a bit misleading (lol), but I think the misunderstanding can be cleared up if you read what's in it.
　Let me summarize briefly in my own way,

		In these cases, there is not much difference as far as the quality of the proposal, but B is unfortunate to be rejected.
		Therefore, the expression "adoption is luck" is used in the sense that "just because a project is rejected does not mean it is a bad project.
		On the other hand,

		B2 is better than B1, B3 is better than B2, this doesn't depend on how you take the axis, and no matter how many times a B1 person applies for the same proposal, it will never be adopted.
