I want to learn systematically
What does "[systematic]" mean when people say they want to "learn systematically"?

　To include all the necessary knowledge without omission?
　[Exhaustive]
　That the development of the explanation can be understood if one has a proper understanding of "what was explained before there"?
		[no leap].

Aside from whether an exhaustive, leap-free education is realistically possible, would you really be happy if it were offered? It would be quite a time investment, though.
