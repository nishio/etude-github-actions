Wary of appeals to the correctness of decisions without results.
[(7.1.3) The correctness of a decision] can only be known after the fact, and when the time comes, it will be self-evident without the need for logic, so we must be wary of anyone who insists strongly on the correctness of his or her decision.
The person is so anxious that he is castrating himself, or he is not making the decision in the first place and "gains by allowing others to make that decision".
