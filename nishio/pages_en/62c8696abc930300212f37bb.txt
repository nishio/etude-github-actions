Not sure if the client's output is correct.
[KJ Method Study Session @ Loftwork]
>I can't decide if the output coming from the client in workshops, etc. is correct or not.

You are not the judge of whether an output is correct or not.

Let's say a client comes up with a hypothesis. "Maybe if I do this, it will work!" And. Whether or not the hypothesis is correct can be determined by running it and observing the results. The client will test the hypothesis by executing it, not by your judgment.

The client says, "Maybe I should do this!" or "I've been wrong so far! it means that a new hypothesis has been generated or an existing assumption has been broken, which is a success for the workshop.
If you're not, and you're just looking at a nice, coherent diagram, then you've probably just traced a shape, and no output has been produced.
