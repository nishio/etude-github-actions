The Curse of Yoichi Ochiai
Whenever I am about to say "I'm busy," the critic in me will ask, "Can you say the same thing in front of [Yoichi Ochiai]?" So I have to say, "I feel like I'm busy...but physically I still have time.

   Is it because I didn't schedule myself to keep my schedule from being filled?

 	>The curse of Yasukazu Nishio: Whenever I use a word with a half-defined definition, he asks, "What does that word mean?" I am forced to clarify the definition range and make it clear that my topic deals with a limited range.
 No, I'm sorry, sir. But that's your subjective opinion, isn't it?" (myself).
