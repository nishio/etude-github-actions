sour grapes
Aesop's Fables
The story of the fox who wanted to take the grapes but couldn't and said, "They must be sour grapes" [sore loser].

I consider what I did not get to be worthless.

The opposite of [the fish you miss is bigger], you perceive what you didn't get as smaller.

[Cognitive dissonance]
