Scrapbox英語化計画
2019-03-21 [Multilingual development based on machine friendly English] reminded me of this article
	Over there, we're talking about creating editions in different languages based on the English version.
	If you put the original text at the end, you don't have to worry so much about translation errors.
	If you don't understand, read below.

After about 10 months, I reconsidered.
	Translated on Scrapbox does not need to be served
	Spit out HTML from JSON in Scrapbox
	How about md5digest for the page title?
		English Title
		英語本文

		Automatic translation from Japanese

 I know in my head that it is better to transmit in English.
  but not much motivation to pay the additional cost unless the need is immediate.
 What you write in Scrapbox should be automatically translated into English and reprinted by Google Translate
 But Scrapbox's API seems to be too cumbersome to achieve sequential updates.
 As a small start, you could first export it in JSON, translate it, and import it.
	先頭行に`(auto-translated from [Japanese http://....])`と挿入する？
 It's social [triggered] when people around the world react to it.

	Unfortunately, it appears that the brackets do not translate correctly.
 	Actual Design - [Mechanical Design] Concepts and Methods
		`Actual design - [way of thinking and method of mechanical design]`
	Tags with sharps would be blanked out.
		`[3 levels of design]: [instinct, action, introspection] #instinct #action #introspection`.
  `[Three levels of design]: [instinct, action, introspective] # instinct # action # introspective`

	Why don't you translate it into HTML with wget or something and then translate it?
 	Not much difference.
