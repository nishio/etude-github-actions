Writing normally makes for long, blog-like sentences.
Statement by [Tadanori Kurashita] at [Scrapbox Drinkup 20180810

 From an Evernote-like perspective, it feels under-featured, there is not enough information to be automatically captured.
 I read [/shokai/Scrapbox Philosophy] and thought, "Well.
  "[Not] a warehouse of dead texts."
  There is no point in taking it in automatically.
  It makes sense to write your own description and add your own links.
 I don't think I would have understood it if I first read the philosophy of shokai, I understood it because I used it for a while before I read it.
 	The writing itself shows the philosophy
  The normal way of writing would be long, blog-like sentences.
  That page embodies how it should be used.
