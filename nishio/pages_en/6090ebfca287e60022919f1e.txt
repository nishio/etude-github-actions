 *1232461815* How to get out of a slump
 <a href='http://blog.nnfh.net/?eid=206787'>About Slump Escape Methods</a>

 He hits back with a slow swing at a loose ball that even a junior high school student could hit. Repeat. It may not look like I was in a hurry, but this was the shortest way to get out of my slump.

 I wonder what the programming equivalent of "a loose ball that even a junior high school student could hit" would be.
 
 **1232473733* President Obama's Live Broadcast
 I heard through online chat that it was going to start soon, and I watched it on the online broadcast (Ustream). I thought it was good to see such a spirit of challenging new things. There were some Japanese people speaking in Japanese in the accompanying chat room, but there were also comments in Korean, and I think there were some non-English speakers who used the alphabet. There are a certain amount of such people in every country. Also, it is a good time when people of various backgrounds can get together in one place at a very low cost.

 It is very interesting to see people from different cultures seeing and talking about the same thing in different languages.
 
 *1232476435* Fibonacci Sequence
 I wrote this because some people called it Fibonacci in the buzzard comments.
 
 >|python|
 def fib1(n):
     if n < 2:
         return 1
     return fib1(n - 1) + fib1(n - 2)
 
 print [fib1(n) for n in range(10)]
 # => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
 
 def fib2(n):
     x, y = 1, 1
     for i in range(n):
         x, y = y, x + y
     return x
 
 print [fib2(n) for n in range(10)]
 # => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]     
 ||<
 
 It is a secret that when I first pasted it, x + y became x + 1 and the test code should have been fib2, but it was fib1 and I didn't notice the mistake.
 
 *1232477861*Part of template engine
 The way out of a slump is to solve easy problems without rushing, and so I wrote this problem, which happened to be circulating on the mailing list, because I thought I could write about it in about 10 lines.

 >|python|
 def resolve(query):
 　base, rest = query.split(".", 1)
 　base = globals()[base]
 　keys = rest.split(".")
 　for k in keys:
 　　if isinstance(base, list):
 　　　base = base[int(k)]
 　　else:
 　　　base = base[k]
 
 　return base
 
 mylist = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
 mydict = {"foo": 1, "bar": 2}
 mynested = [{"foo": [1, 2, 3]}]
 
 print resolve("mylist.1") # bar
 print resolve("mydict.bar") # 2
 print resolve("mynested.0.foo.2") # 3
 ||<
 
 In my perception, a problem that can be written in 10 lines and 1 function is equivalent to a "loose ball".

 <body>How about rewriting code that you have written in the past in a different language? <br>It could be something mega-demo-like, or a game engine. </body>
