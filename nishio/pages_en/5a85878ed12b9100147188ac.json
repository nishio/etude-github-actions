Notes on time series data analysis
[A list of points to keep in mind when analyzing time-series data, which is common in the field of practice - Blog of a data scientist working in Roppongi http://tjo.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/09/22/190000]
 There is a [correlation] between the two [time series data], but the weekly periodic component is just on both, and if you remove it, there is no correlation.
	Fitting trending time series data is difficult.

  >When the original series ytyt is a non-stationary process and the difference series is a stationary process, the process is called a unit root process.
  [Random walk] is a [unit root process].
  The phenomenon of "spurious regression
   If we regress a unit root process on a unit root process, we get a sham regression.
   Regression of a time series of stock prices on a random walk yields a highly significant model with a high probability of significance.
   take the difference
 	You can't take the difference if there is a republican portion.
   Using the [Vector Error Correction Model](VECM)

 stochastic process
 	[Steady state process]
  [Autoregressive summed moving average] process ([ARIMA])
  [Vector autoregressive] process ([VAR])
