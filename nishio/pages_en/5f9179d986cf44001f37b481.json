　Thoughts.
　　Cannot be greater than min of input
　　Time difference is up to 12
　　From the condition of being an integer, there are only 13 possible values
　　Three identical values are 0
　　0 with two 12s.
　　One zero is zero.
　　If two values are the same, the difference between them cannot be greater than min
　　If we assign different values to those that have two, and search for those that have only one in each of the two ways, the worst case scenario is 2^12, so clearly there is room for more!
　　Summary, N increases to 50, but the key is to keep the number of searches required small.
　Official Explanation
　 Assumed solution by the above
　　Alternative solution: linear order if it can be shown that the solution alternately assigned to the left and right is optimal
