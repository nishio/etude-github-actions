	>At the end of the 19th century, when [democracy] was advancing and history was being driven by "[crowds]," French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon attempted to elucidate the psychology of crowds from a psychological perspective. [Based on historical facts such as the French Revolution and the emergence of Napoleon, he sharply analyzed the characteristics of "crowd psychology" and its merits and demerits, and warned against "irrational behavior of crowds" associated with immature minds such as "following the crowd. This is a classic work that paved the way for the development of today's social psychology research.
