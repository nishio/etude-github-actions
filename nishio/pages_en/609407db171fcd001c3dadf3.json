public to private transfer
As for the public/private divide, my old self pointed out that it's a false dichotomy, and I'd like to think about it some more.
ã€€[private/public split]
ã€€Private to public transfers can be done.
ã€€ã€€Try [âœ…scrapbox-Duplicator].

ã€€ã€€The private to public transfer doesn't meet my needs.
ã€€Made: [find links between multiple projects].
ã€€ This one doesn't really fit our needs either.
ã€€What is wrong? How can I fit my needs?

ã€€It seems like a good idea to overwrite the transfer from public to private, not update the public page in the private project, and provide an easy way to create a key page.
