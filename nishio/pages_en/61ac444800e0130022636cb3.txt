　I was told about a resource pack called XRay.
　It worked fine in the Java version.
　My wife also uses Bedrock's Realm to play 1.18 on Switch
　　Considering if we can put it in here as well.
　　Packs used in the Java version will not fit as is or with different extensions, manifest.json is required
　　There is an online package store thing, I searched and found some hits, but they were paid for.
　　I also found a package for Bedrock and put it in.
　　　Blocks become completely transparent so they get lost.
　　　A little inconvenient because you can't turn it on and off while playing.
　I was wondering if [WheatSeedsSystem] could be run by Bedrock after all this experience. I have a feeling that [WheatSeedsSystem] can be run on Bedrock.
　　If you want to use it from the Switch, you need a way to create various items without using commands.
　　Add a recipe?
