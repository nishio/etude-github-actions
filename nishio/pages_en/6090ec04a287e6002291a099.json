 It's already 6:00! Not enough creativity!

 Humanity should invent a drug OR machine that produces creativity as soon as possible!

 I'm going to get a substance that excites the central nervous system and causes arousal.

 I will obtain 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, an alkaloid that has stimulant effects by antagonizing adenosine receptors. It is said to be slightly addictive, but if the benefits of taking it outweigh the risks, it would be reasonable to take it.
 <<
 
 >>
 I've ingested some stimulant chemicals and now I'm going to go trip for a bit!

 Tripping Now

 I'm disappointed that no one has responded to my tripping declaration. But why is it that working on the train is so much easier? Maybe because I have nothing else to do.

 id:ak9 Instead of no login, we should make Nico Nico Douga (Yutaka) where you can't comment.

 No kidding, this is the right answer. If you are going to have customers who can't be bothered to type on a keyboard, being able to type comments doesn't give them a benefit.
 
 *1271654038*How to address bumpy right edge in Pages
 <img src="http://gyazo.com/8ea73f89fe1a4c108cdd145f6403b3be.png">
 There is a left/right alignment at the end of the buttons for right-align or left-align.
 
 In Pages, abstract styles such as "body" and "heading" are separated from specific styles such as "right-align" and "font size." Therefore, if you set "right-align" in an appropriate body part and "redefine style from selected area," all areas where the body style is applied will be right-aligned. Convenient.
 
 I was afraid that the small letters at the end of paragraphs would be scanty if I aligned them left to right, but my fears were unfounded. But I was wrong. It is wonderful.
 
 
 I don't know how it works in Word because I haven't used MS Word for a long time.

 Installing cocos2d template

 そして/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project Templates/にcocos2d 0.99.2ってディレクトリはできているけど空っぽ。
 
 . I read /install-templates.sh and found that the -f option forces install even if there is a directory, so I added it. I was able to install it.

 I'm so happy for you.
 
 Hey, there are only two hours left until the iPad Hackathon starts!
 
 *1271665963*[cocos2d]Sprite
 I was reading the tutorial on http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=2123 and Sprite.h and Sprite have been renamed to CCSprite.h and CCSprite respectively.
 
 At least the ball is out.
 >|objc|
 CCSprite* ball = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"r1.png"];
 ball.position = ccp(240, 160);
 [self addChild:ball];
 ||<
 
 I'd like to get the ball rolling for now.
 
 <hr>
 
 Ah. Instead of reading the tutorial, I thought it would be much better to read the test code, which is of course kept up-to-date since it is test code.
 
 *1271667944*[ObjC]XCode recall in progress
 - Cmd+B to build, Cmd+Sht+B for build results, Cmd+Enter to build and run
 - Esc for completion, Ctrl+/ for next placeholder, right arrow to confirm with the currently displayed completion candidate
 - Cmd+Opt+Upでfoo.mとfoo.hの切り替え
 - NSLog(@"hoge"); NSLog(@"%f, %f", x, y); NSLog(@"%@", nsstr); see log with black icon above editor
 - If you throw an exception and it dies, click on the thin gap above the editor and it is a stack trace.
 -[super init];ditch and get stuck in(id)init
 - -(id)initでreturn self;しわすれる
 
 
 A rather minimal-looking piece of code:.
 >|objc|
 // Ball.h
 @interface Ball : CCSprite {
 	float vx;
 }
 @property float vx;
 - (void)update:(ccTime)dt;
 @end
 ||<
 
 
 >|objc|
 // Ball.m
 #import "Ball.h"
 
 @implementation Ball
 @synthesize vx;
 - (id)init{
     self = [super init];
     if (self != nil) {
         // do something
     }
     return self;	
 }
 
 - (void)update:(ccTime)dt
 {
     // do something
 }
 @end
 ||<
 
 For example, when you set NSString* something as a property, the setter has to "increment the reference count" (retain).
 >|objc|
 @property(retain) CCSprite* sprite;
 ||<
 
 Sample using @selector
 >|objc|
 CCMenuItem *mnu_next = [CCMenuItemFont itemFromString: @"next>>" target: self selector: @selector(next:)];
 //(略)
 -(void)next: (id)sender{
 	NSLog(@"next!");
 }

 *1271681353*aipad
 It's huge! It's big enough for two adults to play a game against each other. We played field hockey! The photo apps are bigger than most digital photo frames, so it's cool! Also, the iPhone app was working with the screen enlarged.
