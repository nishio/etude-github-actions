Do not spoil the manufacturing mindset.
	Someone tried programming in a way that I didn't really understand.
 I worked hard to get it to about 90% completion, but some parts are not working right.
 In fact, to achieve our goal, we could have written a one-line import statement without that effort
 Q: Is it OK to say, "To achieve that objective, you need only write this one line of import statement
 西尾の意見
 	not good
		It is like telling a fisherman, "If you want fish, you can buy it at the supermarket" [parable of the fish and fishing].
		Spoil the feeling of having progressed to 90% completion.
  	That kind of experience will make them less likely to "make it on their own" in the future.
   You start to think, "All I have to do is find the right stuff and import it."
    In reality, it's unlikely you'll find one that really fits your purpose.
    Because people's needs are so diverse
    Look for it, don't find it, and blame others who don't provide it.
    And what's being offered is also created by someone else.
		No one can make something perfect from the start.
  	All artifacts started out as imperfect things by people who were enthusiastic about making them
   Everyone who uses artifacts is a beneficiary of the manufacturing mindset
   Therefore, we must place importance on protecting and nurturing [the manufacturing mindset].
   Do not spoil the manufacturing mindset.
   Those who have the enthusiasm to create, and those who have created something imperfect, are the future treasures of the world.
   Do not undermine their motivation.
