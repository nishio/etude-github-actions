Live streaming instead of videoconferencing
 I saw a guy the other day who was trying to teach a class of over 100 people with a videoconferencing tool and was having trouble limiting the number of people, but maybe it would be good if the know-how of using "[live streaming]" instead of "[videoconference]" was more widespread.
	There is also a way to use [sli.do] to accept questions, for example.
	If you use a video conferencing tool, like [Zoom], you can use the [webinar] function.
