 *1359874224* Diary of my wife and Agricola - Round 3
 A two-player "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B009KY3PTU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B009KY3PTU& LinkCode=as2&tag=nishioyome-22">Agricola: Farm Animals Japanese Version</a>" for my wife and I.
 
 Last time (<a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20130128/1359342122'>Diary of playing Agricola for two with my wife</a>), we fought twice, and although I won the first round handily against my wife who did not understand how to calculate the score In the second round, I got the farm expansion board one move early and fell behind after that. I will not lose this time.
 
 Last time my wife said, "It takes at least 4 turns to try to get at least 4 cows and 4 horses and both. This is too costly, so you might as well cut one of them down". My strategy this time, on the other hand, was to "take the horse in the first and second rounds and increase the number of horses early on", focusing on the fact that "all animals cost the same to hold one of them, but the horse has the most victory points".
 
 I was on the back foot. The first round went fairly normally, and in the last round I took a horse and put it to live in a dwelling. My wife set up an empty stable with stones, resources, and stables. I was one step ahead of her as planned.
 
 I thought, "I'm going to get a horse," but my wife's first move in the second round was to prevent me from getting two horses to enter the breeding system. But don't worry, my move was "Build a shelter with 2 wood and 1 stone. I get one horse as a bonus for building it. How did I do? I kept the lead! My wife's turn: "Convert the stables into a livestock resting place. Get a horse as a bonus. At the end of the second round, both players have two horses each.
 
 While my wife again took the farm expansion board first, my side tried to get at least 4 animals of all kinds by "taking the cows and letting the sheep go that had no place to put them" and so on. The final screen, as shown below, was a 3x3 square filled to the brim on both sides, with my wife having 0 cows and me having 4 or more animals to avoid a negative bonus.

 I counted the number of animals and to my surprise, both tied with 30. I had 5,9,6,10 while my wife had 14,6,0,10. My strategy of collecting horses first didn't work at all. It seemed that the situation where a total of 20 horses were used was not expected, and I had to substitute brown circles because I ran out of frames.
 
 In the bonus for the number of animals, my wife got +4 points for a sheep, but lost 3 points for not having a cow, while I got a pig and a cow in the last round, so I moved up in rank to +2 for a pig and +1 for a cow, totaling +3.
 
 We both have one expansion bonus each, so we are tied. Then the buildings: my wife has 2 livestock resting places + 4 livestock pens, and I have 1 stable x2, giving her a 4 point lead. My wife upgraded the stables to a corral on the last turn for +3 victory points, which seems to have been an effective move.
 
 In the end, this time the game was "tied on the number of animals, I had a 2 point lead on the animal type bonus, but my wife had a 4 point lead on the building victory points, and I lost by 2 points. Gnargh. I lost again.
 
 According to my wife, "the negative bonus for discarding one type of animal is not a big deal because of the +3 points for upgrading the stables". For me, I didn't expect the "sheep head count bonus is surprisingly large". To keep 10 horses, 2 squares + 2 mangers are used, but it only costs 10 points + 4 bonus points, or 14 points, for that many horses. The sheep are not as good as horses, but they are easier to obtain, so if there are 14 sheep, the cost is 14 points plus 4 bonus points, which is 18 points. It seems that it is better to have a lot of sheep than to have a half-way decent amount of horses at the cost of "2 squares + 2 mangers".
 
 Postscript. According to my wife, "The livestock resting place was my goal from the beginning. At the end of the first round, the husband did not have a stable, so he decided that there was no need to rush the construction and seized the horses first. Gunnu.
