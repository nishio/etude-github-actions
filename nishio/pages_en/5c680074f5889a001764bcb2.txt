Hooks to fish for what has not yet been verbalized.
[https://gyazo.com/f6a26af4f454f6271512fd320aa27797]
	I want to verbalize what is not yet [verbalized].
		I want to [catch] the [whale] in the figure on the water.
	To do that, we need to hit a lot of [hooks] to [fish them out] first.
		This hook is not the whale itself.
		It is a temporary tool for fishing whales
	Return this analogy ([fishing for whales] â†’ language)
		I want to verbalize what is not verbalized.
		To do that, we need to list more and more words that might be associated with it.

		[No need to be hasty in formulating]: Formulate only after you have a firm grasp of the language.
		Record seemingly unrelated thoughts that occur to you.
			At this point, "[seemingly unrelated]" may just be "[not yet discovered relationship]".

	Picture originally written by [sticky note is not the main body] to explain the KJ method.
	But since this was born, it's been used surprisingly everywhere.
		Often mismatched context with title "Sticky note is not the body".
	So I sorted it out.
