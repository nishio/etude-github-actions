N values are updated, I want to know the minimum value.
from [heapq]
There are N values and they are being updated, I want to know the minimum value.
â†’ Queue a tuple of which value was updated to what and when. Store the last modified time of the value in an array of size N. Skip information that is not up-to-date when retrieving.
code:python
 N = 2
 values = [None] * N
 lastUpdate = [0] * N
 queue = []
 time = 0
 
 
 def update(pos, value):
     global time
     time += 1
     values[pos] = value
     heappush(queue, (value, pos, time))
     lastUpdate[pos] = time
 
 
 def top():
     while queue:
         value, pos, time = queue[0]
         if time == lastUpdate[pos]:
             return value
         heappop(queue)
     return None
 
 
 update(0, 42)
 print(top())  # => 42
 update(1, 43)
 print(top())  # => 42
 update(0, 44)
 print(top())  # => 43
