Are constraints necessary for creation?
from [/villagepump/constraints create creativity].
　Not so far as "constraints are necessary for creation?"
　　If there are no constraints, you can "create something new" just by randomly changing any parameter[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　 Humans don't place much value on such creations.
　　 　An example of 575 without the restriction of "meaning comes through" is "Aiueo, kakiku-keko-kokeko, sasissusse-so."
　　 So I think it's "[constraints get in the way of creation]" and "[people feel value in creations that overcome constraints].

[Creation]
[Value]
