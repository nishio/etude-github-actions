History
 I made it on 2021-09-12 with an eyeroll.
 	We got excited about the idea of having a micro server in the unexplored junior game chat.
 　[nishio.icon] had no experience with the Java version, but decided on the Java version because we thought it would be more interesting to extend it with plug-ins if we were going to manage a server.
 　　I didn't know the difference between plugins and mods and set up a vanilla server, then I was told about PaperMC and made the change.
