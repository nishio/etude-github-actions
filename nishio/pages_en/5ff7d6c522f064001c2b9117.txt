Organized story
When I was describing [Regroup] as "software that helps you sort fragmented keywords to create an organized story," I realized that there are two interpretations of "[Regroup]" to begin with.

If you interpret organization as creating a state where "things are sorted and lined up on shelves," it is hard to get a clear picture of the type of organization that "yields [a story] as a product of the organization.

　The [Organized Classified Shelf] type of organization aims to store everything in the proper classification.
　The [Organized Story] type of organization aims to disconnect the many [associative] links and make them into a single path.

Even if you do your best to organize the former type, you will only be able to "[enumerate] tasteless facts" and will not be able to create a story.
It is not a good idea to throw out the [link of association]([context]).
