Innovation and Markets
The definitions of both [innovation] and [market] are fluffy.
 The process of creating something new and having a significant impact on society.
 The process by which something that does not yet exist (0) is created (1) and becomes something that has a significant impact on society (100).

	Of this process, the 0 to 1 process occurs within the individual
 	[Ideas] come from within the individual.
 Whether or not the idea will grow into something bigger.
  It is important to communicate ideas to others
  Good ideas get the attention of others, get feedback for improvement, and grow see [how to create ideas].
  I call this "exposing it to others' evaluations and trying to see if you can get feedback on improvement" "market evaluation".
  In that sense, the 1 to 100 process happens in the market.
 I call the 0 to 100 process innovation.
 	Some call 0 to 1 innovation.
