　Thoughts.
　　When merging, upstream cannot be selected at the same time.
　　If you choose upstream, you must also choose downstream.
　　SAT-like
　　　But it's a matter of counting up instead of building one, so it's not.
　　[strongly-coupled component decomposition].
　　　Isolated loops are "choose all" or "don't choose all".
　　　What about the rest?
　　　　DAG...
　　　　No, it's not a DAG, there's only one edge from one vertex, so there's no branching.
　　　Isolated loops and trees flowing into loops
　　　　How to calculate the tree part...
　　　No, I thought you couldn't choose the tree part in the first place.
　　　　Confluence occurs at the point of flow into the loop, but condition 2 cannot be met.
　　　Eventually, the number of loops is 2^N-1 with N as the number of loops.
　Official Explanation
　　The number of loops and the number of connected components match
