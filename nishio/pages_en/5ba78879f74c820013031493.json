Do I need to explain the goodness?
	Is it necessary to say "this tool is good" about a certain tool?
 Of course, this is a difficult problem when you make your living by making a living from that tool, but let's shelve that.
 Wouldn't it be sufficient to explain that "this tool does what it does?"
 	Whether it is good or bad, whether they use it or not, is for them to decide.
 	The best tool depends on what they are trying to do.
  The work of helping them choose the right one for their situation is highly intellectual production and should be charged a consulting fee.
 For example, with regard to programming languages, "this programming language is good" is a religion, isn't it?
 The fact that a tool is good should not be explained in words, but rather told by the good results achieved by using the tool.
 Because it is possible to say "this tool is good" even if the tool is bad, so there is no information content in that utterance.
