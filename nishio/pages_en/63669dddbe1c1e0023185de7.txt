Turn off favicon page with CSS
Scrapbox will [favicon] the image of the page pinned at the top of the list.
　But I don't think the image you want to make easily visible with a small favicon is necessarily the image you want to always be in the upper left corner of the project's home page.
　　I don't like my face to keep showing up there.
　If you create a page just for favicons, it's not the first page you want visitors to see when they visit your project, but it's also not the first page to be pinned.
　So I pinned it and then used CSS to remove the display.
