Book-to-book link discovery system
2019-03-10
	I had the image of dividing a book into pages and then extracting keywords from each page, but based on my experience with Scrapbox, I think what we should do is not keyword extraction, but rather the discovery of "unexpected common keywords between two documents".

	And, of course, dividing books into pages creates self-evidently long keywords.
		For example, a phrase like "100 people, 100 different HR systems" appears many times in a book.
		The fact that this comes up again and again means that it is tied to a concept that is important in the book
			Useful in the sense of "summary."
		But I don't know if this phrase appears in any other book.
			Interesting to note that if any other author's book mentions this phrase.
			I tried to show Jiro Kawakita's original book on "W-type problem-solving model", but when I searched in the library, other books came up.

	It would be more beneficial to focus on "[book-to-book] links."

	As for the recent "wouldn't it be interesting to discover links across books", I had the feeling that it was "the author", not the books.
		It is common for the same author to use the same phrase repeatedly in multiple books.
			It can be funny, though.

	Whether it is interesting or not is subjective, so there needs to be a mechanism to provide feedback after seeing the presentation.
	I like the system that allows incremental growth.
