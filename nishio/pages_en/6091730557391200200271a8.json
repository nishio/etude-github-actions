Links to prior knowledge are needed to deepen thinking
[/shokai/media whose memory is reset every time].
	In an environment where it is difficult to create [links to prerequisite knowledge], you will either have to explain the prerequisites each time or discuss them without sharing the prerequisites.
	If you don't use an environment designed to [deepen thinking], it is inefficient to deepen thinking.
