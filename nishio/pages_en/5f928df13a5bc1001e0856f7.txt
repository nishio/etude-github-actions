　Thoughts.
　　If the number of edges is the number of vertices - 1 for the connected component, then tree
　　Since the total number of edges is known, is it sufficient to find and calculate the number of connected components? →This is wrong.
　　　There could be a connected component that has multiple extra edges.
　　Since there are at most 5050 edges, there is plenty of room to find the connected components and then count the number of edges for each connected component.
　　　For each edge, one vertex belongs to
　Official Explanation
　　[DFS for connected components].
　　If there are already visited vertices other than the direction you came from, there is a closed road.
