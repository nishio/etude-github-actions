binary heap
Note that this is not a [binary heap
It is characterized by faster merging compared to the bicameral heap [data structure].
Insertion averages O(1) in the bipartite heap, but there is no specific merge support, so the total is O(N).
On the other hand, in the case of a binomial heap, it is O(logN)
I saw a statement that adding one element at a cost also takes O(logN) because of the merge... but I think this is also an average O(1), just as [insertion of a binary heap takes an average constant time].


Merge, Insert, Find Minimum, Subtract Key Value, Delete O(logN)
Minimum value search can be O(1) with an additional twist
