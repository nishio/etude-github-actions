Read/write Windows shared folders in Ubuntu
$ mount -t cifs -o username=***,password=***,uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g) //*1*/Users/nishio/Documents/shared ~/shared
	*1*: IP address of the Windows machine
	Share files in advance.

If you just read it, you don't need `uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g)`, but the owner of the directory is root, so you get an error when you try to create a file.
