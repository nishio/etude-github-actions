figurative grasp of numbers
The way people perceive [number] is very different. Explanation of my cognition.

■ "How much is 29 * 31?" In response to the question

First, we recognize that it's roughly 30 squares, and then we make a [rough] estimate of "roughly 900.
The deviation of this approximation from the exact value of 899 is about 0.1%, which is sufficient in many practical cases.

When it becomes necessary to calculate more precisely, the shaded area in the right figure is peeled off and moved to the dotted area.
In this case, the shaded area is 30 in length, but the dotted area is 29, so there is 1 extra. Therefore, subtract 1 for 899.

■"How much is 1+4+9+... How much is +10000?" In response to the question

First, he makes a rough estimate that "the volume of a square pyramid is 100*100*100/3, which is about 330,000.
The exact value is 338350, so the error of "about 30,000" is 2.5%, and if we divide properly and get "333333", the error is about 1.5%.

If you need to be more precise, you can get closer by adding 10,000 cubes to a triangular pyramid, which is actually a cube, and then subtract 1666. This gives a rough estimate of 341667, which is 0.97% of the error. The reason why it is still off is that the slope is not a triangular pyramid but a mixture of a quadrangle and a slope when divided into blocks. 5/6 * 100 and 1/2 * 9900 are added to 333333 to arrive at 338366, which gives an error of 0.0047%. I would hardly ever go this far by rote.

On this topic, "Since the later the larger, wouldn't it be a good approximation if we only added the last 20%?" (This is just a feeling I have, but if I calculate it properly, it is 0.512, so the error is about 2%). This is based on the thought, "So, even if we add the last 20%, it is only about half of the total.

■"What is the cubic root of 1729.03?" Regarding the question "What is the cube root of 1729.03?
The correct answer was 12.0023, so the error was about 3.3%. To explain what kind of thinking was going on here, first there was "a cube with 10 pieces has a volume of 1000," and then to make the calculation easier, the units were unconsciously changed to tenths to find the cubic root of 1.72, so 0.72, which is not included in the cube, was spread over three sides of the cube, an area of 3, The thickness of the painted area is 0.24. So, since it is 1.24, the answer is 12.4, changing the units back to the original.

The approximate result is larger because the groove portion of the paint spread is open. Considering filling the groove, 0.24 is roughly 1/4, so we should subtract 1/4 from 24, and 1/4 is 6, so 18. This will further halve the error.

■"Which is a better deal, 30 sheets of Nori for 350 yen or 20 sheets of Nori for 250 yen?"
Wife: "350 divided by 30 is a little over 110, 250 divided by 20 is a little over 120, so 350 is a good deal."
I said, "As a figure, 350 is more flatter, so 350 is a good deal. If I dare to explain in words, there is a rectangle of "roughly 100 yen" and both have 50 left over. The excess 50 can be divided into 30 pieces or 20 pieces. 30 pieces are thinner. So 30 sheets for 350 yen is cheaper."
