What is "Yasukazu Nishio's Scrapbox"?
2023-02-14
　This page was largely written in 2018, about a year into using Scrapbox.
　Five years have passed since then, but I never looked at this page thinking to myself, "What is this?" I never look at this page thinking to myself, "What is this?
　Especially the sort order description, which already didn't exist.
　Updated: [what is this?]

What is Scrapbox?
 It is a place to accumulate and place information.
 As for this place, it is written by Nishio alone, so it is more like a blog.
 Fragments of more detailed units than a blog will also be written.
 Scrappbox is a system that [uses links to structure information], so a network of knowledge gradually grows.
 I am very excited about Scrapbox as a tool for intellectual production!

[*** Guide for New Scrapbox Readers].
	Sort Method
 	This one in the upper right corner.
  	[https://gyazo.com/7442144c7eef8a02f8c82a7e245cc1a7]
  [* Recommendation]: Most linked is a result of Nishio linking all over the place, and the hubby-like place is at the top of the list.
  	This is the option that will be most distinctive when compared to Scrapbox's other services.
		Most popular will display in order of most viewed.
  	Equivalent to the "most read posts" often found in blog sidebars.
   Although it is [social proof] that others have evaluated it, there is a high element of luck, as it is easy to stick to the top of the list just by getting buzzed about on social networking sites.
	 Trending is the order of most recently viewed.
  	Detailed algorithms are not disclosed, probably.
  Data modified is the order of most recently updated.
   I usually have this setup.
  	Not recommended unless you want to follow Nishio's most recent thoughts. Miscellaneous manuscripts that have been written will be at the top of the list.

	Meaning of various links in the page
  The blue links are to other pages in Scrapbox.
  The red link is "a door that does not yet lead anywhere", so clicking on it is pointless.
   Think of it as highlighting keywords.
  Blue underlined links are links outside of Scrapbox.

	Meaning of the green and gray lines on the left edge of the page
 	They are called "telomeres." For a detailed description, see [/shokai/telomere].
  Unread lines (= lines that have been updated since the last visit) are green
		The more recently updated, the thicker.
  Click here to get the permalink to the line so you can mention it.

 You can also follow the path by clicking on the links that appear at the bottom of each page that interest you
 The [Blind Spot Card] is a catalog of [blind spots] that I had created before I started using Scrapbox.
 [Parables] is a catalog of parables that I started writing after I started using Scrapbox.

[*** how to send feedback]
	Comments, feedback, questions, objections, and counter-arguments are welcome!
 But unfortunately Scrapbox does not have a comment function.
 I'd be most grateful if you could tell me directly on Facebook, Twitter, or email.
 My email address is `nishio (dot) hirokazu (at) gmail (dot) com`.

[*** Why Scrapbox?]
	Q: Why am I so impressed with Scrapbox when I was not impressed with many of the services I transitioned to from Hatena Diary?
	A: Consider the functions that blogs used to have as "flow" and "stock".
 	The role of the flow part, i.e., the immediate distribution of information, in which updates of what has been written are notified via RSS, etc., and people who have read the latest posts send trackbacks, which stimulates discussion..., has been eclipsed by the prosperity of Twitter and Facebook.
 	With respect to the remaining stock portion, existing blogging systems are weak in their support for discovering relationships between individual entries. Even as the stockpile of entries grows, the total value increases only in a less than linear fashion.
 	Scrapbox seems to be the most serious within the scope of observation in the direction of how to turn stocked information into structured information.
