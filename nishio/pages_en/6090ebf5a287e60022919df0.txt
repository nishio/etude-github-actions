 *1203840084* throbbing won't stop
 In a migraine sense.
 
 Oh no, I'm cold even though I'm wearing a jacket in a heated room. Is it a cold? Let's go to bed...
 
 *1203840666* For now.
 
 Lying down.

 *1203853306*Okita
 I woke up to the sound of the java-ja banquet being Usted.
 
 Ah, it's already 8:30. It's already 8:30 p.m. Both 86 and java-ja seemed to be having fun, but I just slept because of a headache. I'm so depressed.
 
 But if I had been forced to participate, it might have been more difficult after tomorrow. I guess it can't be helped.

 The swelling of the tonsils has subsided about 80%.
 I'm going to go to the supermarket and buy a few things before it closes.
 
 *1203858255* Notes on presenting the same content.
 What we tend to do when presenting the same content more than once (especially when there are people in the audience who have seen the same content presented before).
 
 - "This is the material I presented at ________."
 - "I know some of you have seen it."
 - Sorry for the repetition.
 - Not much has changed, though.
 - I'll skip this one because I've done it before.
 - "It's a thing because it's spoiled (to the point of laughter)."
 
 Since the target audience for that presentation is those who have not yet heard it, we should not spoil the experience for first-time listeners by worrying too much about what those who have already heard the presentation think. For first-time listeners, statements like the above are "useless information" or "offensive" or "alienating".
 
 This is not just about today's announcement by id:s******; I have had a vague, hazy feeling ever since I saw id:s******_***'s announcement in December and id:i**_***'s announcement the other day.
 
 Extra. When you introduce yourself in a place where people already know you, the embarrassment of introducing yourself causes you to lie about your identity in order to get a laugh.
 - "I've been learning AS3 lately, and I write a little bit of Python, maybe one line."
 - "I'm from java-ja. I've been studying AS3 lately."
 Since the target audience for self-introductions is people who do not know you, you should not try to gain popularity by introducing yourself in this way. The more you make your story popular, the more the people to whom you should have introduced yourself will feel alienated, wondering why they are the only ones laughing around you.
 
 *1203860140*Write your thoughts while they're hot.
 At the first meeting, I was thinking "I'm the organizer, so I have to write properly," but time passed and I ended up saying "It's OK because amachang wrote it. I think it is better to write my impressions as soon as I get back home or the next day.
 
 *1203865465* 25 year old young man dies of a disease in 4 days.

 Wow, 17 updates since the beginning of this year.

 The Chinese Ministry of Health has reported a new human case of H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case is a 22-year-old male from Jianghua District, Yongzhou City, Hunan Province.
 The man developed the disease on January 16, was hospitalized on January 23, and died on January 24. The case was confirmed by the national laboratory on February 17. An investigation into the source of the man's infection is underway.
 Of the 28 cases confirmed so far in China, 18 have died.

 Just a month ago, a 22 year old died right next door. And within a week of the onset. I didn't know that. It's a fact that should be better known.

 Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population announced two new human cases of H5N1 avian influenza.
 The first case was a 25-year-old woman from Dakahlyah administrative district and Dekerns district. The woman developed the disease on December 26, was hospitalized on December 27, and died on December 30.
 The second case was a 36-year-old woman from Menofia administrative district and Menof district. The woman developed the disease on December 26, was hospitalized on December 29, and died on December 31. To date, there is no evidence of epidemiological association between this case and the previous case in Menofia administrative district presented on December 28 last year.
 Both women had contact with sick or dead birds prior to the onset of the disease. Of the 43 cases identified so far in Egypt, 18 have died.
 <<
 
 Even over here, a 25 year old young man died within 4 days of the onset of the disease. We should do more to spread the word that bird flu is a terrible disease that can kill a young person within a week. I think most people think "bird flu is something that birds get" or "people who die from bird flu are old people anyway, so it has nothing to do with me.
 
 And for now, don't go where the birds are! >id:jbking
 
 *1203868602* Monday already?
 I'm taking Tuesday-Thursday off, but I have no idea what to say at the progress report meeting on Friday. Shall I take Friday off too?
 
 *1203870745*N95 mask
 <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/N95%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF">N95 mask - Wikipedia</a> that was effective in preventing SARS infection, but as far as this definition is concerned, I bought it at a convenience store at the station. The Clean Line Kowa 3D mask claims to "cut 99.9% of airborne particulates (0.0001mm)", so it meets the N95 requirements, right?

 So I transplanted it to Grimon.

 Oh, I didn't know that was going to happen.

 I was actually going to add [], but I got some kind of regular expression error (I couldn't get around it by doing âŒ˜[ or something like that), so I gave up.

 Huh? Can you do it?
 
 Perhaps:

 Oh, wow. I thought they looked so much alike when I saw them, but when I put them side by side, they look surprisingly similar, don't they? Were you fooled by the suit + glasses + hair?

 According to id:hogelog, I am similar to id:tasukuchan.

 id:tasukuchan
 mjd!!!
 Let's sell the fact that he has a voice similar to id:gyuque and a face similar to id:Kishi! (What?

 In other words, am I correct in understanding that "Gunyara-kun's Gunyagunya Movie (lead actor: Kishi, voice actor: gyuque)" will be released soon? (Yeah.
