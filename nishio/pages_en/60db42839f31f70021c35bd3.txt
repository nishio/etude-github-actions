Extension to use Keicho with Scrapbox
Extension to use [Keicho] in Scrapbox

Extension to use Keicho with [/blu3mo-public/Scrapbox].
When was it born?
PopupMenu asking [/takker/selection to Keicho].
If you write the talkid in the page, you can keep the conversation going, I see.

I was thinking of creating a [scbot] that writes to Scrapbox, but I narrowed my view to the "bot actively writes" pattern and thought "there's no API for writing, so it's a hassle".
