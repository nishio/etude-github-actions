The time and effort it takes to see what you have written
Twitter doesn't show my past posts when I open the top page `https://twitter.com/`.
　It's a screen where you can see and post other people's posts.
　Profile page `https://twitter.com/nishio` must be opened

I opened `https://scrapbox.io/` in Scrapbox and was redirected to `https://scrapbox.io/nishio/`.
　How does it work?
　I can see "what I wrote" because this is a personal project.
