A look back at the first half of 2021
[2021]
as planned
	I made a listening chat [Keicho].
	I did a connection from the listening chat to [Regroup].
		I used it to prepare materials for Saturday lectures at Nada School, etc.
		The goal was to lower the psychological hurdle for Regroup newbies to make stickies, but I don't think it's gone down.
		　There's a hurdle in properly inscribing chatty long sentences on a sticky note.

Plans not done
　Create an explanation of how to use Regroup for specific applications.
　　Before adding more explanations, it is necessary to make the basic functions work stably without bugs and make the UI easy to understand.
　　Since it is difficult to fix it in the current situation without much testing, we decided to rebuild Movidea
　Write user-friendly explanations for [link suggestions], connect to Regroup
