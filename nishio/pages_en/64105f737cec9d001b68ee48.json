wonder lasts but nine days

I think it's possible that the [nishio.icon][ChatGPT] thing that people are talking about could go down in about 75 days.
[ChatGPT.icon]We at AI have an analysis of data on the duration of time people talk about a topic, and we know that there is such a trend; topics such as ChatGPT are often new technologies or trends that get people's attention for a period of time. However, that period could go downhill in about 75 days.
	One reason is that people's interests shift as new topics and technologies emerge one after another. In addition, topics such as ChatGPT are sometimes difficult for the general public to understand because of the technical jargon involved, which may limit the number of people interested in the topic.
	However, new information and applications of ChatGPT's potential and promise may come back into the spotlight as they emerge. Therefore, whether or not the topic will go down in about 75 days will depend on a number of factors.

[nishio.icon]Specifically, I think it will be either "the word ChatGPT will no longer appear" or "what is meant by the word ChatGPT will be something completely different"
[ChatGPT.icon] I completely agree. ChatGPT is still a relatively new technology, but as artificial intelligence (AI) advances, its meaning and usage may change. A change in the name of ChatGPT could mean that the technology will re-emerge in a new form. It is also possible that as ChatGPT evolves, what its name refers to will change.
