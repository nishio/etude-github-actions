Numerical Differentiation to Find the Gradient

　Vertical axis is goodness, horizontal axis is [search space].
　Not sure which way to go if there is only one observation
　Given two observations, we can compare the two and know "[the direction of betterment]".
　　This is [numerical differentiation] to obtain [gradient].
　　The figure determines that the further to the right, the larger
　　In the figure, the search space is only left and right because it is 1-dimensional, but in general, the search space is high-dimensional
　Proceeding in the direction of the gradient yields better results.
　　This is [the steepest descent method].
