We don't let homo sapiens abstract us.
from [book is already an abstraction product].
	>If you put yourself in the shoes of a program that has a memory more plentiful and reliable than the temporary memory of Homo sapiens, you will feel like, "Don't pre-process with a poor memory, but output raw data.
　On the other hand, you can't apply it without abstraction, what do you do about the problem there?
　　A program with a high enough abstraction ability than Homo sapiens is likely to think, "Homo sapiens should not abstract on its own, but communicate the observed facts as they are, and we will decide on our own policy and communicate it, so don't make your own judgments and do as we tell you to do.
　　This is just like [hierarchical organization].
　　Hierarchical organizations are slow and noisy in the transfer of information between humans, which reduces their performance when scaled up.
　　　In short, the problem is that there is a limit to the number of homo sapiens "who can receive information".
　　　So if you want to increase the number of people, you need to increase the hierarchy, and more hierarchy means more delay and noise.
　　　If an intelligent body is born whose performance there is higher than that of Homo sapiens, hierarchical organization with one level of hierarchy will be optimal.
