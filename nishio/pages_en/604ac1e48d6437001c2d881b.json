Remo Impressions
>I was told that Remo's online get-togethers are easier to get into because, unlike Zoom, you know in advance who will be at your table, but I ended up spending time at a table by myself as I dithered about where to go and ended up with a real online replica of an offline get-together situation when no one I knew was there.
