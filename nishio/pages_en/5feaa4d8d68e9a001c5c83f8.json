Landing point of the KJ method
I thought that one of the reasons why [the KJ method] is difficult to understand is that the landing point is not clear when I read [Textbook of Design Research].

[Empathy writing] also specifies a landing spot.

I also feel that I've gotten the hang of it after using the KJ method several times, not for its own sake, but for the purpose of creating a flow for my presentation materials.

On the other hand, [the KJ method for "interesting"] was an objective of the KJ method itself, and it was unclear what would be gained as a result of doing it.
　It is easy to focus on subjectivity as a subject of writing
　The effect is to help people understand their own values.
　Hard to know what you will end up with.
