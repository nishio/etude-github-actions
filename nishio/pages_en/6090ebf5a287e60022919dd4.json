 *1201394820*Serious SoozyConference
 I woke up seriously and took a bath seriously~.
 It's time to get serious about getting ready to go to a serious SoozyConference.
 Serious perverted geek (not in a sexual way, of course)
 The "serious and nitty-gritty" (not "seriously nitty-gritty")
 I'm really looking forward to the announcement (not in a sexual way, of course).
 
 *1201395841*minipython
 I would love to see id:hayamiz include an "assignment operator" in minipython. The one where assignment becomes an expression.
 We had a lot of trouble with that last night.
 
 *1201412734*Seriously on the move
 
 Serious Yochan's car with serious Mr. Takezako and Ainori (not in a sexual way, of course)
 
 *1201440904*I just got back from a serious SoozyConference.
 It was serious.

 *1201441402*Winter is cold
 My toes get cold easily at the slightest touch.
 
 *1201443175* Tickets for live shows and such.
 I've never been to a live show so I'm not sure how it works to get one. Bidding on Yahoo! (Wrong.
 
 I was told by kuboon at
 http://eplus.jp/sys/T1U89P0101P006001P0050001P002013919P0030008P0006
 I see. Pre-order is by lottery, and the general release is on a first-come, first-served basis? I see.
 
 >08/1/22 (Tue) 12:00 - 08/1/27 (Sun) 18:00 Pre-orders accepted
 
 It's already done.
 Can I just register as a member for now and apply the next time there is an opening?
 
 *1201444391*Legal Dispute
 Sometimes I feel like interrupting, but I worry that it would be troublesome if I do and get into an argument. But, well, is it better to write than not to write because I learn more if I write and get poked?
 
 The Terms of Use is only a civil contract,
 - The provider is free to impose restrictions that are questionable from the end.
 - Users are free to agree to those restrictions and enter into usage contracts.
 - Users are free to ignore the restrictions after having signed a contract.
 - The provider is free to unilaterally terminate the contract for breach of contract.
 - The provider is free to sue the user, claiming that he/she has suffered damages due to usage contrary to the contract. Of course, the provider must prove that he/she has suffered damages.
 Is there something wrong with the understanding that
 
 Of course, they can break the contract for the user's failure to abide by the terms of use, but they cannot make the user uninstall or return software that has already been sold. Nor can they board the room and retrieve it. Nor do they have the right to search the room of a user who may not be abiding by the terms of use. The police cannot act on a violation of the Terms of Use due to the principle of non-intervention in civil matters.
 
 I'm a software developer myself, so I'm not too happy about it, but is there something wrong with this understanding?
 
 *1201445377* Foot bath
 I bought a bucket the size of a foot bath that can comfortably hold my feet for a footbath, but I usually fill it with a bath in those situations.
 
 Because even if you fill a footbath sized bucket with hot water, it gets cold quickly. I need a thermostat for footbaths. I said, "Why don't you just add more hot water when it gets cold?" But I don't want the water to get hot or lukewarm, I want it to stay at the right temperature. Hmmm...maybe I should connect a temperature sensor that can measure around 40 degrees Celsius and a heater?

 Halogen heaters, (omitted) most of which use more electricity than air conditioners for small rooms, have been replaced by more efficient carbon heaters as of winter 2007 and have largely disappeared from the sales floors of electronics retailers.

     * I don't know how to make a toString in Java.
     * Cannot define fields of the same name in different classes

 I tried it, but it didn't work, so I asked Lingr about it. I tried it, but it didn't work, so I asked Lingr and it did.

 source code
 >|haskell|
 class ToStringable a where
     toString :: a -> String
 
 data Pair = Pair {car::Pair, cdr::Pair} | Null | Value Int
 
 instance ToStringable Pair where
     toString (Pair x y) = "(" ++ toString x ++ " . " ++ toString y ++ ")"
     toString Null = "()"
     toString (Value x) = show x
 
 
 main = putStrLn $ toString $ (Pair (Value 1) (Pair (Value 2) Null))
 -- (1 . (2 . ()))
 ||<
 
 Overall, I found the distinction between "typeclass", "type", and "data constructor" to be ambiguous to me: Int is a type, Num and Show are typeclasses, Pair is both a type and a data constructor, and Null and Value are data constructors.

 <body>I'm no expert either, but I understand that freedom of contract is limited by the Civil Code, Commercial Code and other laws. <br>For example, the cooling-off system and the fact that contracts made by minors are invalid.... <br>You may want to refer to the WikiPedia page on contracts or Dr. Natsui's "Electronic Signature Law - How to authenticate and operate electronic documents". </body>
