Who learns and creates solutions
There are [those who] learn [solutions] and [those who] create [solutions
　Those who create often [uninformed] create new solutions to problems for which solutions are already known
　[Reinventing the wheel] #Reinventing the wheel
　　Sometimes a better solution.
　It can be beautified and widely disseminated.
	　　[Publication Bias]
　　Most of the time it is a bad one
　A learner cannot solve a problem for which the solution is not written in [the textbook].
　　Often falsely assuming that a problem for which a solution does not yet exist "already exists, I just don't know about it".
　　They feel insecure about their condition, so they jump to [false solutions].
　　They are good dupes for scammers.

relevance
　The concept of [genius and brilliance] may be relevant, but the concepts of genius and brilliance are too vague and further distorted by jealousy, etc., and should not be attributed to that side because it is not convenient.
　Subtle differences between [creators] and [producers
　　People who create solutions don't always create things.
　　Well, the "creator" doesn't necessarily make the "thing" either.
　　I still think these two are [independent] because people are like, "I can only make textbook stuff."

		It's a genius idea! I reacted, and there was an existing solution.
	Can a person who cannot reinvent the wheel invent a new invention?
