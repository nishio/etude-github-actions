Disjoint Sparse Table
Given a sequence of static values of length N, a data structure where the preprocessing O(NlogN) allows operations on the upper interval of the sequence to be computed in O(1)

Conditions required for operation
　[Combining rule]: [$ (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)]
　Unit and inverse yuan are not required.

There is no need to use this for operations with inverse roots, such as addition.
　[cumulative sum] because we can do the same thing with the construction O(N).

Can realize [product except one] by [cumulative product from left to right], e.g., multiplication without the inverse element.
　The Disjoint Sparse Table allows the user to compute the product of arbitrary intervals by combining a large number of cumulative products.
