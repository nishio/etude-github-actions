Conflict-free replicated data type
Conflict-free replicated data type([CRDT])


	operation-based CRDTs
	state-based CRDTs
	>State-based CRDTs are often simpler to design and to implement; their only requirement from the communication substrate is some kind of [gossip protocol].
	>State-based CRDTs are called convergent replicated data types, or CvRDTs. In contrast to CmRDTs, CvRDTs send their full local state to other replicas, where the states are merged by a function which must be [commutative], [associative], and [idempotent]. The merge function provides a join for any pair of replica states, so the set of all states forms a semilattice. The update function must monotonically increase the internal state, according to the same partial order rules as the semilattice.
	>Sequence CRDTs
		> A sequence, list, or ordered set CRDT can be used to build a [Collaborative real-time editor], as an alternative to [Operational transformation] (OT).
		>[LogootSplit] was proposed as an extension of Logoot in order to reduce the metadata for sequence CRDTs.
