Large number of people hanging confidential information on LLM and turning it into money.
Context so far
	[work that is pioneering the forest of what has yet to be written].
	[Semantic Annotation as "Tax Payment"].
	[cryptocurrency to pay for work done for AI].

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642917903090737153] It just occurred to me that if a structure is created in which a huge LLM pays people who give it "useful information that we don't know yet", it is too utopian to assume that people will be engaged in creating new information. I thought that "people will be engaged in creating new information" is too utopian an assumption, and that there will be a large number of "people who will drop secret information to LLMs and turn it into money" before that happens.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642918622816526336] Is it utopia because we can evolve into an integrated thought body where secrets and lies do not exist? ()

>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1642923721718480901] How do you determine what you don't know yet? I'm wondering if you monitor the words that people put in, respond anyway, and let them rate the responses, and the low ones are the "sought-after" ones, and you give back a reward for putting in the domain knowledge there.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642926068884721664] It's relatively easy to determine "what we don't know yet" and "what is required" but difficult to determine "that the answer is not false". Basically, I think you have to collect a lot of them and throw out the outliers.

		> What we don't know yet (what we didn't know yet): that we can't output the given information by generating a question text that makes the given information the answer and letting the old version answer the question.
	>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1642926276309659651] [peer prediction method] feeling (the very essence of crowdsourcing)
		>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1642927264739344392] I know this is a bit off topic, but you said that the [prediction market] can gather information by looking at the convergence points of the transactions, besides the end user's benefit from just trading. I remember that. The information you get from the market is more accurate than that of a normal, well-meaning user.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642927258250907648] Ah, but the style of discarding [outliers] would play the "truth that is different from most people's expectations"...
 	>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1642927473686970368] so I guess [staking] depending on how determined you are!
 	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642928903068213249] Well, sure. If it is false information, it is a deterrent for people who input appropriate information.
  >[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1642930511269052426] Staking is really deep, and Vitalik's knowledge of game theory and social science is remarkable!

>[sirouto https://twitter.com/sirouto/status/1642926096818786304] I'm sorry to ask a simple question, but would you pay a fee when you can learn for free from the internet?ã€€Even if you buy unknown information, you need credentials. For example, information that "Company A" will launch a new product next year cannot be determined to be true by machine learning of text. Rather, it is likely to take a posting fee, similar to search, and place a link ad in the AI's response.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642928162635149313] This is after the information that can be learned for free from the internet has been learned and it becomes a race to find out how to get other information. There is no need for AI to do the true/false judgment, just give it to humans and let humans make the judgment on whether it is useful or not.


>[shima__shima https://twitter.com/shima__shima/status/1642918349922521088] Before that happens, I think there will be a lot of people spouting off random things.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1642919096298930176] If it is determined that you told a lie in light of other information, your account will be banned and you will die financially [deterrent]!
