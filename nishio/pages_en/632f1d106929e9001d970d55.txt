Be positive by noticing who came up with the idea before you did.
When you come up with an idea A and then realize that someone else came up with A before you, some people feel negative and some feel positive.

negative pattern
　Myself, "I think it would be good to do A."
　Others "thought it would be a good idea for me to do A in the past too."
　Myself, "Well, I'm disappointed that I'm not first."

positive pattern
　Myself, "I think it would be good to do A."
　Others "thought it would be a good idea for me to do A in the past too."
　I said to myself, "Oh! I knew it, you should do A!"

What's the difference?
	Mr. Negative sees value in "the first thing that comes to his mind.
		So the value is lost when it turns out that someone else came up with the idea first.
	Mr. Positive sees value in "good ideas".
		Therefore, the fact that others have come up with the same idea is perceived as something like "I got a favorable opinion for my idea.
		I am not interested in which came first.
