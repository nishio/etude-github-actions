Learn [how to solve] and apply it to [new problem] #Abstraction

How do you learn how to solve it?
 Solve lots of problems
 	However, if the "problem" is a "managerial issue," the authority to "solve" = "decide resource allocation" is not given.
  To gain authority, one needs to acquire high competence, but to acquire competence one needs authority for experience
  [chicken and egg]
 Observe many problems and their solutions as the next best thing.
 	Parallel work] is useful for this.
 	This is also the purpose of [case studies] in MBA/MOT, etc.

	When you say [knowledge exchange] between organizations, some people are concerned about [NDAs] and [trade secrets].
 	When we talk about the benefits of knowledge exchange, we are not imagining such raw information, but abstracted "[solution]" knowledge
 	We are not advocating violating NDAs or leaking trade secrets in the first place, and such actions should still be tried as illegal acts.

 [Abstraction Capabilities]
  It would be good if I could abstract my problem and discuss it with you.

		>One of the reasons why having high abstraction skills helps you do your job much better is that you can avoid [NDAs] and ask people for advice by explaining your problem in different words....
  >If you have poor abstraction skills, you will die if you follow the NDA to the letter and can't discuss it with anyone.
