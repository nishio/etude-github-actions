Diary of Thumb Shift on Mac 2020-01
summary
	Day 1
		First attempt in a year and a half with a fully invisible over-the-knee keyboard shio shift arrangement.
		Drawing layout ancho by hand on iPad
			Added shortcut keys for kana-kanji conversion and cursor movement.
			Added an index to efficiently locate letters
		Example Sentence Input Practice
	2nd day
		I'm tired of practicing typing example sentences.
		Consider example sentences for programming
		Create a layout clearing program
	3rd day
		The home position stuff is much smoother.
		Print out an ancho and attach it to the top of the monitor.
	Day 4
		I'm tired of practicing only example sentences for home position, so I'm going to make an example sentence book 2 that uses all the letters.
	5th day
		I tested how well I remembered the layout, and I didn't remember as much as I expected.
		Add example sentences to cover what you don't remember.
		Almost correct on third test.
	Day 6
		Yesterday, the squares and letters were in any order, but I was able to answer correctly, so I put the letters in aieo order -> almost correct.
		After practicing yesterday and today, I spend much less time looking for letters.
	Days 7-9
		I skipped practice for three days.
	Day 10
		I was 10% faster while I wasn't practicing.
		It was found that it takes about 50% more time to input data without looking at Anchoko than when looking at Anchoko.

		My last thumb shift challenge on a Mac was frustrated when I tried to get Karabiner to recognize simultaneous keystrokes and it didn't work.
			There's a desire to "do it with one software rather than two."
		I'm not sure whether to use the recommended configuration of Karabiner+Lacaille or Lacaille alone this time.
		But editing the environment itself while training "myself to adapt to the environment" is a bad idea, so I'll use the recommended configuration for now.
			It seems like a good idea to gradually "abolish Karabiner without changing its behavior" after I adapt to it.
		Keyboard Settings
			>"Enter numbers in full-width characters" is off
				I did this too.
			I had a mysterious phenomenon where "logistic regression" was converted to "riga" in Mac Live Conversion, but it was fixed immediately by Keyboard -> Input Source -> Conversion Learning: Reset, so it seems that the cause is still that the learning is going wrong.

			I did this too.

		This time, I'm not just going to use a thumb shift, I'm going to use an "on-knee keyboard".
		That's why I drew it.
		[https://gyazo.com/820f29bcb96dafc9f458b0a3135b568d]
			Gray is "Do I need it?" I don't know if I need it.
			Red marks are small letters
			The brown mark is a semitone.
			I don't dare draw a muddled sound on a distant shift.
				It is easier to find the desired letter if you don't write anything extra.
		I'll leave the template in case I need to redraw it:)

			The bottom row is longer than the top row because the diagram ignores the space between the keys in the actual product.
			Instead of opening the gap as in reality, we decided to make the cursor keys a little narrower than in reality

So this is typed with thumb shift
　(Flick input) Notes on what I thought
　　After mistakenly moving my hand to backspace, etc., my right hand returns to the "unshifted home position".
　　Confused trying to correct a live conversion error "sold".
　　　I see, ctrl+h and ctrl+n are also affected by orz and shifted to the right.

[https://gyazo.com/2ab6f33e496c1fc6a1254788bbc6f078]
So I also added a shortcut [/shio/ 4 settings and 1 training#59a4f7459f6c420000b5966a] for drafting on the new Mac.
I still have a bit of a chip on my shoulder, but I can do a lot better.
The ability to backspace without looking at the hand is a big change.
I have the impression that the quality of the experience has changed dramatically.
Feeling like backspace is not ctrl+h, but moving the left pinky and right index finger to the left.
　(Flick input) I had difficulty entering the above English letters because I couldn't see the keyboard, and I registered "←" in zh as a word, but I was confused because I couldn't get it out.

[https://gyazo.com/9479da2572ce346f691cf386a1148eec]
So I added the English letters as well.
word register
	root direction
	sleazy direction
	root drop
	sleep↑
	Nayoro ⇔ (used as a rough indicator of location, direction, time, etc.)
	≠≠≠
	Ne-ne-ne...
⇔↓…≠

[https://gyazo.com/9479da2572ce346f691cf386a1148eec]
I pressed the right command key and triggered an unexpected command.
I changed it to a key with a carabiner because it's dangerous.
I see, up until now I've been assuming I remember where the English letters are on the keyboard, and commands and such are stacked on top of them.
Something new is happening in the brain with that rearrangement and invisibility.

It's been a year and a half since my last practice, and I can type a sentence without too much trouble.
English letters are a challenge Apple Magic Keyboard

[Karabiner+Lacaille type thumb shift with SandS].

It's called by the same term "thumb shift" but the configuration varies from person to person. I feel like I don't have enough vocabulary to describe it.
	Physical keys are JIS aligned
	Karabiner+Lacaille type thumb shift
		Make orz layout with Karabiner
		NICOLA emulation with Lacaille
	Align the vertical relationship of symbols with the US layout

I made a careless mistake where to write "mi", but I was able to remember all of them successfully.

I made a careless mistake in where to write the first three words, but I was able to memorize all of them successfully.
 >Kazuhiro Shiozawa Is this a fill-in-the-blank question?　If so, I can't do this more than half the time. When I think of a letter (or sound), like "Let's type 'a'", my finger moves on its own and I can type the letter, but when asked "What is this key in thumb shift?" I can't answer half of the question. On the violin, if someone asks me, "What note is the position of the 3 finger on the first position of the D line?" I can't answer without thinking, but if I hold the violin and think, "Let's play the note of So," I can play it.
 	This is a fill-in-the-blank question. I tested it once, decided I hadn't practiced enough for the letter I couldn't fill in, added an example sentence using that letter, and did it twice, and on the third test I got all the questions correct.
		The order in which the blanks are filled in is not constrained, so if you record the finger that moved with the image of entering "A", you should get a perfect score.

Day 6
Yesterday, the squares and letters were in any order.
	First, the conditions under which it is permissible to write "Ushikese ha tokiin
Easily done and more restrictive.
Since it is impractical to designate cells, designate letters.

[https://gyazo.com/a2049aac4f116339e7bd449fd9146eb0]
I couldn't remember the "mu" and remembered it after the "wa".
Also, "la" and "yo" are interchanged.
I forgot to measure the time.

After practicing yesterday and today, I spend much less time looking for letters.

Day 10
2020-01-01
Happy New Year
I skipped three days of practice, but if I don't catch up with my roman input speed during the year-end and New Year holidays, I may go back to roman input under the pretext of being too busy.
[Prisoner training 2019 recap] was typed with thumb shift, which wasn't that painful.
Maybe it matured while I skipped out and slept.

[2020-01-01 thumb shift measurement].

I'm still 10% faster than I was while I wasn't practicing.

Oriental false hawksbeard (Youngia japonica)
All right hand upper and middle, no shift.

[2020-01-01Not seeing thumb shift ancho].
Don't look at Anchoko7:06
It was found that it takes about 50% more time to input data without looking at Anchoko than when looking at Anchoko.

Thumb shift, I skipped 5 days and it was 10% faster. I found that I can type about 50% faster without looking at Anchoko than with Anchoko. This is also inputting without Anchoko. However, it still takes a lot of time.

[If we follow the idea of "seek accuracy, not speed, and speed will follow", I think it is better to aim to be able to input data without making mistakes without an ancho.

It may be more efficient to learn something that has already been systematized by diligently following a curriculum created by a good trainer, but I get bored very quickly with my accuracy.
The engineer's method of intellectual production p.86 "[Testing is a means of memory]" to relearn by testing and focusing on areas where he made mistakes, and p.99 "[The process of creating deepens understanding]" to create example sentences instead of just repeating what he got wrong.
The current state of affairs, where you can now type without looking at Anchoko, is "[a] fast cycle of testing" (p. 90), where each letter is a test.

The idea of "seek accuracy, not speed, and speed will follow" is an idea imported from [shio], but it appears to be common to the acquisition of physical skills such as musical instruments and sports, not limited to thumb shifting.
[Prisoner training] is a form of training that says it's not good to do a lot of things with the wrong form.

Day 11 2020-01-02
Some writing, but no practice.
The keyboard is not yet a [transparent tool], so it's hard to use it as a tool to organize thoughts that are not coherent.

---
2020-01-07
Not practiced.
I use thumb shift for Japanese input.
Writing the program reverted to the normal key.

[2020-01-07 thumb shift practice].
---2019-12-25 7:14 min 2019-12-26 5:44 min 2019-12-27 5:03 2020-01-01 4:32 4:56 2020-01-07 4:06

It's interesting that I'm not particularly practicing, but I'm getting decently fast.
By the way, this measurement is the time required, including error correction, and is close to the time used for actual input.
This is a learning curve for corrective shortcuts, and the cost per mistake is going down.
Not desirable for accuracy-oriented training.
So I'm going to go back to the "if you make a mistake, start over with a new line" that I did in the early days.

Programming with this keyboard requires getting used to the placement of the symbols, but the current placement is not that reasonable to begin with.
Let's check the frequency.

Higher frequency round and brace brackets than numbers are in remote areas...
If, hypothetically, we could use two different shifts in English mode, we'd have three columns to get everything in and 10 to spare...
I think I can do it by tweaking this area of Lacaille...
