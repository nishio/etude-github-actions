(3.5.7) Make teaching materials yourself
I recommend you to make question cards by yourself. [Piotr Wozniak] of [SuperMemo] also proposed an approach "[Incremental Reading]" that gradually pick sentences worth to remember while reading sentences on SuperMemo, and then converts it into fill-in-the-blank questions. I explain it in Chapter 4 "Incremental Reading" #TODO as one form of reading.
