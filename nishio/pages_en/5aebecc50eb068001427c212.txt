Misunderstanding is Value Creation
	Readers often [misunderstand] what the author is trying to say.
	But this is not a "mistake" or "point deduction" as in a school test.
 The phenomenon that the concept that the reader [reconstructs] from a list of letters on paper is not equal to that of the author.
	 This kind of "reconstructing a new form" is not something authors can do.
 In other words, misunderstanding and communicating that [misunderstanding] to the author is a [productive] activity.
	Conversely, someone who understands 100% of what the author is trying to say without misunderstanding has not yet done any [value creation] at that point

	There is a negative bias in the expression "misunderstanding.
 	When there is a discrepancy between the author's understanding and the reader's understanding, that alone does not make either right
  What is [correctness]?
  	The one that was [useful] is correct.
  The author has invested more time on the subject than the reader and is more likely to have arrived at useful knowledge
  On the other hand, this is not true if the reader has knowledge that the author does not have
  	[Experience] is different for everyone.
   The author has only experienced as much as one human being.
   [Learning from the experience of others].
  Thought experiment:.
   Author who read programming books for 3 years, did not write a single line of programming, and put it all together
   Readers with one year of programming experience

	Requires [a degree] on the part of the author.
		When you observe someone who has interpreted something differently from what you intended to express, instead of cutting them off and saying, "That's a misunderstanding.
		I wonder if there is something useful in that interpretation, or something else.
