âœ…Create a mode of retrospective support
It would be interesting to combine [KPT] and [PRO Model] with Keicho Kikidashi Chat System to create a "Reflection Support Bot".
Now that we have the parts in [âœ…Create Empathy Writing Mode], I'd like to try another [Chatbotting Templates] to get things organized.

 First, decide on a name for the mode.
 ã€€`KPT`
 ã€€âœ…Determine the first message in that mode.
 ã€€ã€€This is a mode to assist you in looking back. Press the "Good", "Bad", and "Things to try" buttons in the input fields."
 ã€€Is [ðŸ¤”Only accept choice answers] better?
ã€€ã€€ã€€No, See: (A)
 server-side
	 Change the client-side hitting API to the local server
	 $ flask run --host=0.0.0.0
	 $ ptw -- tests/test_chat.py
ã€€Implement questions, actions, and state transitions
ã€€ã€€Determine the range of state IDs to assign.
ã€€ã€€ã€€I'll make it the 300s.
ã€€ã€€ã€€No need to save IDs, so state IDs and question IDs should be in the same range
ã€€ã€€Added setting by mode to initialize environment
ã€€ã€€Ahhhh, [ðŸ¤”I can't give you a choice on the first question].
ã€€ã€€ã€€The first answer should be "What would you like to reflect on?" because it could be the title of the export to Scrapbox or something like that. (A)
		A clean language approach to KPT.
  ã€€Keep
  ã€€ What good things have happened?
  ã€€ +2 basic questions
  ã€€Problem
  ã€€ What bad things have happened?
  ã€€ What do you hope will happen to you in such a situation?
  ã€€Try
  ã€€ã€€What would you like to try?
  ã€€ If you do that, what happens next?
  ã€€ What is it that you value?
  ã€€ Question of necessity
  ã€€ ã€€Or, can we just relay it to Phase 3?

ã€€If I need to adjust the score calculation, I'll do it.
		â†’Not necessary.

Motion.
ã€€[Reflecting on the addition of a purpose-specific mode].
ã€€Create âœ… expansion mode mediator
