 **1288667545*JS and CSS and printing
 I've made the footnotes appear horizontally like a footnote by using position:absolute in order to print them in PDF format so that I can read them on my iPad, but when I convert them to PDF in Firefox, the offsetTop is set to 0, or they are all overlapped in one place... It was not useful at all.
 
 >|javascript|
 $('<p></p>').text("(Footnotes: " + text + ")")
 .css("position", "absolute")
 .css("top", $(this)[0].offsetTop)
 .css("left", "410px")
 .appendTo("#content");
 ||<
 
 I was relieved when I did it in Safari because it looked fine, but when I got to the bottom of the text, it was slowly shifting... difficult...
