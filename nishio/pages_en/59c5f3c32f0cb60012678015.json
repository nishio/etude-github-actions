dual community
Notation distortion [double organization].
The boundaries of some larger communities are twofold.
 A set of "participants" and a set of "operators"
	A place for "broad and shallow communication" and a place for "deep and narrow communication

Only a small enough community can produce anything beneficial from it.
	My skin feeling in Nishio is that only about 30 people can assemble for one event.
  A "person you met only once at an event" does not function as a human network.
  Once a year," "several times a year," "once a month," "once a week," and so on, gradually becoming a dense network.
  Considering the case of the Unexplored Boost Conference, an annual camp with a common goal is an effective network builder.
 A similar concept is proposed by [Dunbar number].
