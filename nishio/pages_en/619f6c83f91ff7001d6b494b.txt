concrete example
　Create another chat room in addition to the one you don't like, pull key people to it, and let the old one become deserted.
　The strong divisions in a company are made into a separate company or sold off so that the underperforming divisions do not spend the profits made by the strong divisions. The strong divisions will be able to be more active because they no longer have a department to burden them, and the weak divisions will be treated worse because they no longer have a department to feed them.
　　Techniques for leveraging a strong department without directly firing members of an underperforming department.
　When old people are annoying in a community, create a new community in a place where old people don't like to be.
　　It is often difficult to exclude the elderly from a community, but in this pattern, the voluntary exclusion of the elderly from the community is accomplished by their voluntary exclusion from the community.
　[Why social networking sites rise and fall.]
