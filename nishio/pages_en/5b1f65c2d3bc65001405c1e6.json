People remember places not by latitude and longitude, but by paths.
People don't act based on [latitude and longitude] of a place. They move along [roads].
They remember their position in space as a chronological story: which way to go, what to turn right when they see it, and so on.

> No one can ever remember the absolute coordinates (like latitude and longitude) of their house or workplace.
> But I remember how to get there.
>...
> I don't know the latitude and longitude of where I am, but I'm confident I can get there if I start again from the same station.
