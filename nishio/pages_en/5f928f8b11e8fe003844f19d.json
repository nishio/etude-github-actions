　Thoughts.
　　The [extra event] of "none of the pairs are the same height" is "any of the pairs are the same height."
　　It is a combination of "one pair of..." and "two pairs of..."
　　[包除原理]
　　I'm sure they'll make a [frequency table] of heights first.
　　The way the pair is taken is the target, so the state can be compressed.
　　How many "combinations with one pair" are there when there are two, three, four, and so on pairs?
　　Maybe this is not an equation transformation, but a DP to get it?
　　The order is not relevant to how the pairs are taken, so you can introduce the order here
　　Maybe DP in the number of cases where j pairs are made with the first i of a given frequency table X.
　　If there are more than 4 people, there is a possibility of having 2 pairs at a time.
　　 4C2×2C2÷2!
　　N will be almost 100,000...

　　It's the principle of inclusion and exclusion." OK.
　　Create a frequency table" OK
　　Number of cases where k pairs are taken from a set of size 4 or larger" OK
　　Is it [DP]?" No, [convolution].
　　When doing [repeated convolution], you need to be creative with the order.
　　　Attach the shortest first.
