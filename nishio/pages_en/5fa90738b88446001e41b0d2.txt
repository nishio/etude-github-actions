 Thoughts.
  Finally, a huge N problem.
  　Find the point where [Range Sum of circumference] is the largest.
  　Double the cumulative sum
  　Still, if the starting and ending points are free, the order of the square
  　[Shakudori method].
  　Which one should I do at the time of equalization?
  　　Shrink?
  　　When it's equal, the answer is zero, so you're done.
  　　I went through it, so I'm good.
