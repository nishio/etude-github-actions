Flask-CORS
When I set up a server with Flask to experiment with experimental functions, the server's API is blocked by the CORS policy when I try to read the JS of the content placed on another server.

code::
	Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

server-side
 Use [Flask]-[CORS] (`pip install -U flask-cors`)
 	https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  code:diff
     from flask import Flask
   + from flask_cors import CORS
   
     app = Flask(__name__)
   + CORS(app)

client-side
 code:diff
    fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/", {
  +  mode: "cors",
     method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    }).then((response) => {

Flask receives the data as json since it is hit with "Content-Type": "application/json".
	I forgot to do this and got a 400 Bad Request.
	[400 Bad Request by hitting Flask from JS].

[preflight request in OPTIONS is 308 Permanent Redirect].
	Caused by trailing slash
