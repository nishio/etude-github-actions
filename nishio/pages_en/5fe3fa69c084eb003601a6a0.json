	You want to avoid including WR, which in essence means you want to R*W*.
	If you look at it from the far right and far left, and replace the stones that are breaking the rules, the extent to which the rules are being followed will monotonically increase.

	　No color change required.
	　If the color change is valid, then the replacement of the target stone is equally valid (miscellaneous).

　　A slightly more sane explanation
　　　Consider the given columns rearranged to satisfy the condition
　　　The number of discrepancies of the current column with that column is called the cost
　　　The above replacement operation always reduces the cost by 2
　　　Color change reduces cost by 1 and moves one red castle boundary.
　　　　If the stone whose affiliation has been changed due to the boundary move is of the correct color, the cost is reduced by an additional 1, but if not, the cost is increased by 1.
　　　Thus, the color change reduces the cost by a maximum value of 2. This is as efficient or less efficient than replacement.
