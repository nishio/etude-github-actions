 *1301803550* I've seen the Ghost in the Shell 3D movie.
 Maybe it was because I saw it too late in the day, but the commercials for the other movies before the broadcast made it seem like it was for adults. And the horror movies in particular were, well, you know... bloody, little faces stuck in lunch boxes, etc. If you don't like it, close your ears and eyes, keep your mouth shut, and endure the loneliness!
 
 The world of the cybernetic world is suitable for 3D. I was thrilled to see the movie "Cyber World," but I thought it would be nice to see the trailer on the 3D TV in the lobby while I was waiting. I had seen 3D TVs such as Avatar at an electronics store, but I did not want to buy one, but after seeing Ghost in the Shell, I wanted to buy one.
