Sharing the process of making
	We need to share [the process of making], not [the finished product
	Even if information is shared only about the finished product, it is impossible to learn how to create it.
	The [class] is a gift of karma.
		So [shio] doesn't share the "drawn diagram" in class, but rather "shows the diagram"
	The same goes for [mob programming], etc.
