Curse Countermeasures
https://note.com/urihari/n/nb3fef8334e0f

I see...
　Confronting the curse with the purchase of gold coins does not buy the genus state.
　　This claim could be verified with an average purchasing power calculator.
　Trying to discard curses with compression cards is also futile.
　　Unless you're in a position where the compression is working before you hit the curse and you can hit the card for compression every time.
　Buy a province with 5 gold. One more mountain when the province and the curse wither.
