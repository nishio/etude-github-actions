電通の責任三カ条
[Hideo Yoshida] Created in 1953 by the fourth president and removed from the employee handbook in 1987.
 >1. The person who gives an order, reconfirms an order, communicates, or reports is responsible for the results of the order, order, communication, or report until the results are verified and its effect is known. Responsibility within that limit cannot be avoided.
 >If you do not have the wisdom and talent to know and do the first ten things you hear, then you must have the attention and sense of responsibility to hear the first thing and do the first thing perfectly. A person who hears one thing and gets ten things wrong can do a hundred harms and not a single good. He is a cancer of the organization. They should be removed.
 >3. For us, formal theories of responsibility no longer have a shred of value. Our work spews blood when we poke it. We put our lives on the line each and every day.
