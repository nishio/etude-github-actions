Diversity of Perspectives Bonus
	In the case of a company where being at company X and doing company X's work are loosely coupled, the "possibility of being at company X and not doing company X's work" and the "possibility of not being at company X and doing company X's work" cancel each other out and are negligibly small compared to the "perspective diversity bonus" of doing multiple company jobs.
	Well, but it seems to depend on the company-by-company situation of "how much the company wants the diversity bonus." When a major product crosses [the chasm], will the demand for diversity bonuses increase because it is useful to adapt to the needs of a diverse majority?

[Diversity] Bonus for [Perspective

	After a while, I reexamined the situation and realized that "there is a possibility of losing concentration thinking about Y" is not limited to cases where Y is a side job, but can also be a family member, caregiver, or romantic partner, and the request to "not lose concentration while at work" is quite impersonal and unbalanced.
