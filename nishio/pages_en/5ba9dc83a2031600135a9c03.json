Language
	In the world in general, "language" might mean "Japanese," "English," etc.
 In my case, I limit myself to "[natural language]" when referring to such things.
 So if you simply go with "language," it's that higher level concept.
	What is Language:.
 [$ L\subset \Sigma ^{*}=\{\langle \sigma _{1},\sigma _{2},...\rangle |\sigma _{i}\in \Sigma \}]
	It is a set of alphabetic columns
 I wonder if this "alphabet" can be misunderstood like A-Z.
	Whatever, I should be a little more careful with my language.
