When in doubt
Words that help you decide when you are faced with multiple options and you are not sure which one to choose.
 If you're confused, that means your evaluation of each of your options isn't much different, so you can toss a coin and decide.
 If you're not sure whether to do it or not, do it. If you don't do it, nothing will change your perspective.
 If you're confused between two choices, add an option and make it three choices.
 If one of them is the one that you think you should do, discard that one. If it's really better to do it and you want to do it, you're already doing it.
 ã€€PS: Another explanation for clarity: "If you think you should do one of the two options and you are not doing it, then you don't want to do that option quite as much as you do the other option. Better to do the option you want to do."
