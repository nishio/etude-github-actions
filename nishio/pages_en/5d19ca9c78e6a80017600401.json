Lasso selection to move several together
	I want to move all selections together.
		It's about time we had the ability to move all the selections together after selecting them.
		It's about time I had a hard time, diagram.

		Without collective movement of selected objects, it is not possible to organize them together when the information increases beyond a certain level...
		If we dare to limit the functionality to what we have now, it could be possible to group them and move them around,
   There is not yet the ability to move grouped stickies out of the group or move them within the group.
   Once grouped together, they become fixed.

	The move is implemented in a separate tool to begin with.
	Do not commonize.
		A single move in DefaultTool will eventually be added to a Group's children or something if it is dropped into a Group.
		On the other hand, if I am moving multiple selections in LassoTool and some of the selections come on top of the Group, it would be strange if they are added to the children.
			No, not really?
				If the mouse pointer ends up on top of a group, should all the multiple selections be added to the group?
	I knew I shouldn't have, the abstraction is different in these two tools.
		On the DefaultTool side, the behavior depends on the object that was there when it was first MouseDown.
		The LassoTool side moves parallel to the selected object independently of it.

I could implement it.
