 *1333535751*A library was created to make Alloy's relationships vivid.
 Since relationships are the basic building blocks of language, "alloy" is often used as an example of "human relationships" in order to explain them using familiar "relationships". However, a romance between a man3 and a woman1 is like chewing sand and tasteless, isn't it? Therefore, I created a library to give a unique name to an object from among the choices given to it.

 Susumuひどいｗｗ
 
 The source code was placed in the learning_alloy repository along with other code written during the study: https://github.com/nishio/learning_alloy
 
 Here is the code I used to create this image: https://github.com/nishio/learning_alloy/blob/master/demo_of_named_man.als
 
 The library is a polymorphic module that takes parameters and creates many signatures as children of the signatures given as arguments, each with a constraint that "only one signature at most may exist". In the "tool/" directory, there is a Python script that generates the Alloy code to create this.

 run {
   #Man = 3

 } for 10

 I'd rather use typescope. run {} for exactly 3 Man, exactly 5 Woman
 
 ** 追記
 
 lone sig X, Y, Z extends Base {} とかできるのか。
 
 ** 追記
 
 There's enum Base {X, Y, Z} and so on. In this library, the individual names are lone, but if you want to use one, it is smarter to use enum.
