		Definite execution after a finite number of steps.
		= Not "if you're unlucky, you'll have to wait endlessly."
	Those who wait have Node.
		next: Node*
		wait: boolean
	There is a pointer tail pointing to the "end of column", initially null
	People who want to get in line swap pointers to the tail and their own node atomically.
		If the result of the swap is null, you know you are at the top of the queue.
			Locked out.
			Process.
		If not null, you know who is in line in front of you, so you make their .next a pointer to yourself.
		Wait until the value of wait becomes false
	If next is not null, next.wait is set to false if next is not null for those who have finished processing.
