In order to learn from all people, we need to focus on "what they have and what they don't have," not "what I have and what they don't have.
This requires training. In the default state, the "difference between those who know a lot and those who don't know a lot" is clear with respect to what you know a lot about, and the "difference between those who know a lot and those who don't know a lot" is unclear with respect to what you don't know a lot about, resulting in a bias that you know a lot in general.
One solution is to take an interest in the other person's past experiences. When it comes to the other person's past experiences, the other person is the most knowledgeable person in the world, and you know nothing about it unless they tell you. Since this structure is self-evident, it is difficult to fall into bias.
