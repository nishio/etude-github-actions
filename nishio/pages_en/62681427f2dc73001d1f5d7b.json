Mentors are free of charge
I know this is a matter of opinion, but it's important, so I'll verbalize it.
　Fact: Mentoring for unexplored juniors is free of charge.
　Related Fact: Directors of unexplored associations are also free of charge.
　discussion
　　There's an argument that goes something like, "You should be paid for your labor."
　　It is not impossible to pay some, but it is impossible to pay an amount equivalent to what the person would get if he/she worked in a for-profit company.
　　Many people are not motivated by financial rewards in the first place.
　　　Some people don't do it if they're going to get paid.
　　　I'm in the "you can offer a reward, but I won't accept it" camp.
　　　It can be counterproductive.
　　　　>The undermining effect refers to the reduction of motivation by providing extrinsic motivation, such as a reward, for an intrinsically motivated action. [Undermining effect - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82 %B0%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C]
　　Those who perceive mentoring as labor for compensation are likely not appropriate mentors in the first place.
　　　People who try to do work for less than market labor compensation for the purpose of monetary compensation are likely not performing in the marketplace.
　　　A: Low performers have time but no money due to lack of work
　　　B: Medium performance people have money because they have jobs, but not time
　　　C: High performers no longer need to work full time to earn the money they need and have the money and time to do so.
　　　I want to mentor this C person.
　　　　Trying to motivate people with money in this case is not effective because they have the financial means to do so, and on the contrary, it attracts people A
　　　Don't use A's as mentors.
　　　　Be especially careful as a mentor to young people.
　　　　These people have unfulfilled [needs for approval] and [needs for power], so they try to satisfy them by inappropriate behavior toward young people.
　　　People who can't afford their own finances should work for themselves first, without thinking about working for the public good.
　　It is not beneficial to offer some compensation.
　　　Paying out rewards incurs significant administrative costs.
　　　It's ridiculous and we don't reward them for it.
　　But there is, however, an opposing view.
　　　This is just because the unexplored group happened to be able to attract enough quality mentors without having to pay them, which is generally not possible.
　　　It would be better to offer rewards, especially for the younger generation of unexplored graduates.
　　　　I think it would be more helpful to actively increase the number of "slightly older brother/sister" mentors to help form an intergenerational network.
　　　It is not easy to realize this point easily, so rather than changing the current unexplored juniors, it is better to have a trial and error process when new ones are created, and the ones that worked well will remain and the ones that did not will be eliminated
