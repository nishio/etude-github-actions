The value of flesh and blood is the question.
I was rereading [my type of advice to contest applicants] that I wrote two years ago, and I reconfirmed that I have been wondering since then whether I should give them knowledge or not.
ã€€Supplement: Doesn't giving knowledge [by descent] undermine [spontaneity]? Question.

Reflect on your own behavior
	If you were asked, "Which would you prefer, Method A or Method B?" I would say, "Of course A, because..." but if someone says, "I'll do it with method B! I see.
	The more spontaneous the behavior, the less knowledge you gain, and the more you're doing the opposite of what's ideal.
	The former question is, "I leave the helm to the PM."
		If the former is favored over the latter, it would be counterproductive to the goal of fostering human resources who can run alone.
	Why do you want B?" I wonder if it would be better to ask the question.
		Neither books nor web articles [ask situational questions].
		The value of having [a live person] accompany the project is [a question].
