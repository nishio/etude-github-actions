 [https://t.co/KqW9ryQAT7 To 2017: "Childhood is over. Now is the Time to Build the Tower of Babel" (Part I) | FUZE]
 	[Yoichi Ochiai]
		[End of childhood].
		[Tower of Babel]

	A major shift from "sharing experiences with the group" to "expanding individual capabilities.
	[Optimistic Singularity] and [Technophobia].
		In the future, everything in reality will be manipulated without distinction between matter and substance, what shall we call it? I call it not Mixed Reality, but rather a new nature, "Digital Nature.
	It wasn't a machine that beat Lee Sedol in Go, but a [computer-friendly] engineering expert, not a Go expert.
		What was the value of the vague prospect of joblessness in 2040? Much of it resembled the [doomsday] theories of the last century.
		Where in this world is there a local that can live on basic income? It is in blue America. There would be no other place in the world where people could live by doing what only human beings can do - spending their leisure time doing creative activities - and where enough wealth would be gathered to make that possible.
		The only way is to work well so as not to be eliminated as a cost by increasing affinity with machines, or to take jobs away from other humans after mastering the machines. This is not a battle between machines and humans, but between "humans" and "humans with high affinity for machines.
	Protopia" brought about by the fluidity of technology
		[Kevin Kelly]
		[Protopia] is a worldview that gradually improves through [fluidity] of repeated [technological innovation], a self-organized, non-uniform, "[sane dystopia]. In other words, it is a kind of [optimistic technological thinking].
			More than any possible dystopia or protopia, its greatest barrier is [technophobia] itself... It is not the closed system that is more frightening, but the [technophobic] power that hates change in the system. Power that prevents democratization creates more distorted disparities.
	[A Century of Magic].
		[The 20th century, when the [mass media]-type information transmission system dominated the world, was called the "century of images,
		As a contrast, this century, in which everything has been "[black-boxed]" = "[magicked]" by computers," has been called the "magic century.
			In reference to the book "[Re-magic of the World]" by the American social critic [Morris Berman].
		[VR for the poor" = "the kind of reality I wish I had.
			Oxford University Press has chosen "[Post-Truth]" as the word of the year.
				It means that objective facts and truth are not considered important in political choices.
				Here I had a sense of glimpse of 21st century humanity.
	Is truth justice? And is fiction evil?
		Does it make sense to create unified feelings, rules and games in the midst of multiple communities and [values]?
			Instead of talking in terms of "shoulds" for rules, it would be better to consider the economic and emotional synergies.
			We can no longer seek one trend or value.
			Majority rule is a means of bringing about a reality that is slightly at odds with each community.
	The changes that are taking place now, the age of opinion rather than truth, can be summed up in one word: "the adaptation of mankind.
		If we try to estimate the human race afterwards by our habits, norms, and ideas before they were changed by technology, it will cause friction with technology. The change that is taking place now, the age of opinion rather than truth, can be summed up in one word: human adaptation.
