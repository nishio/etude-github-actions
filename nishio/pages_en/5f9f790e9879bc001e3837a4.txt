If it's a joke, it's not funny to me.
When you get comments on social networking sites that you don't quite understand what they are trying to say.

Option 1: Ignore
Option 2: "I'm not sure what you mean."
ã€€A variant of this is "I'm not sure what you're getting at, but if you're joking it's not funny to me"
