　[consider in order from the smallest to the largest].
　　When t is a single letter, i is the first occurrence in s
　　　When it does not appear, -1
　　When t is two characters
　　　First appearance after first appearance
　　　naively we can find the "first occurrence after x" on the order of 10^5
　　　No, because the naive way would be 10^10.
　　　For example, if you pre-calculate the "next occurrence" in a 26 x 10^5 table, it will be in constant order.
　　　This pretreatment is
　　　　Looking at the string s one character at a time, starting from the back of the string s.
　　　　　Writing the -1
　　　　If a character is found, write 0, and increment thereafter.
　　　　　Zero if found again.
　　　　When you get to the beginning of the string, if it is not -1, fill it from the end, incrementing while the table is -1.
　　　　This will fill the table in two laps at worst per letter.
　　　Looking at the i+1st letter c, we can see "the number of letters after i until the next occurrence of c" in constant order.
　　　Just add up these values for each letter of T.
