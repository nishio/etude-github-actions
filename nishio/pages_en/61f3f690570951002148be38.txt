Having no passion.
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Having no passion.
viii 
This is the privilege of the highest mind. Because of its nobility, it is not affected by transient, low impulses. There is no higher rule than to rule oneself and one's impulses: there is the triumph of free will. Don't aspire to high office while your passions rule your personality. That is the only refined way to avoid scandal, nay, the shortest way back to a good reputation.
