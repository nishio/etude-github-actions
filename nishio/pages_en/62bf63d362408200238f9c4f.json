Winograd
>Terry Allen Winograd (February 24, 1946) is a computer scientist at Stanford University. He is known in the field of artificial intelligence for his work on natural language using a system called [SHRDLU].

>In developing SHRDLU (SHRDLU, 1968 - 1970), Winograd considered the problem of how to provide computers with sufficient "comprehension" to enable them to use natural language, and restricted SHRDLU's comprehension The SHRDLU's world of comprehension was restricted to a virtual "world of building blocks". The program could receive commands such as "move the blue building blocks" and perform the requested action using its virtual arms, and it could also respond with language, such as "I don't know which blue building block you are talking about.
