Unexplored Togetter Summary
	I would like to compile the Tweet that got excited every time we had an unexplored results debriefing session (Demo day), etc.
 `#mitoudemoday` tags are used to make it easier to pick up.
 There are a rather large number of things that are referred to as "unexplored" that are not.
  Filters the "Unexplored Summoning" lanobes and the "Unexplored Za" theater troupe.
	You could also find an "account that is clearly in the venue" and sink it.
 I can use the filter I've been working on to help me put it together on Togetter.
