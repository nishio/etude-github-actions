Overestimation of the value of in-house knowledge
[https://gyazo.com/311e188ed72133e9e94aeabde462d152]
	Left, comparing internal knowledge with knowledge that is distributed outside the company to an unspecified number of people, [internal knowledge] is more valuable, I think [fallacy].
	 Narrow vision and lack of [relativization] of viewpoints.
	 It is strange that you compare internal "knowledge that is not distributed to a large number of people" with external "knowledge that is [* distributed to a large number of people].
 Right, actually there are many more companies than the one you belong to.
	 Of course there is "unspecified knowledge that is not distributed to the general public" within those companies.
 Bias to assume that what is not observable does not exist
 I know this sounds obvious if you think about it for a minute, but there seems to be a disease that prevents us from understanding these obvious things.
 I think it has been mentioned repeatedly as a kind of typical [big business disease].
