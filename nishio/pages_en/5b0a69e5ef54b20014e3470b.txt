We need a language by a handful of people on how to tag or "tag".

  >I rarely use hashtags.
  When multiple seminars share a project
  	Rules for hashtagging which seminar.
  Multiple arguments for a single issue
   Rules for hashtagging for easy tracing of history
  All other tags enclose words in the text with square brackets
  >The criteria for selecting strings to be tagged is "future-self perspective". It is what do you want to extract in your future self?

The "future-self perspective" is a good keyword, and "structuring information" is done "so that it will be useful when you use the information in the future.
	If it's hard to imagine yourself in the future, what would you like to see happen if you and a colleague were working on a project together?
	Not limited to tagging
  Pin any pages that you think are "good to look at first."
  	If there are too many to just pin and feel bad about it, make a page that summarizes the best pages to look at.
 Since everything is subject to full-text search, there is no need to tag things that can be done with full-text search
 	The only benefit of putting a "cat" tag on every "cat" page that comes up is that you can have a "cat" page.
	If you can't think of anything in particular, add one or more zany links, and they will surface at some point.
