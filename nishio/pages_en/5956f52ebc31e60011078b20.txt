Reproduction for information analysis is legal.
I made this page because I couldn't find a good page for a quick introduction.

In 2009, the Copyright Law was amended so that reproduction for information analysis, etc. does not constitute copyright infringement. Documents written before this revision or pages that discuss copyright in the case of information analysis without mentioning this provision may be out of date and should not be trusted.

[Copyright Act http://law.e-gov.go.jp/htmldata/S45/S45HO048.html] Subsection 5 Limitation of Copyright Article 47-7 Reproduction for Information Analysis, etc.
