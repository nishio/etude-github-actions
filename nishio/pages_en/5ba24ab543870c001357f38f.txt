Designing ways to learn
[Kyoto University Summer Design School] 2014 "Designing [Learning] - Finding [Blind Spots]" Lecture Material
http://nhiro.org/kuds2014/
>How do you guys do it [think about difficult problems]? It is important to [write it down and then think about it]. It is obvious if you think about which is easier, blindfolded chess or regular chess, or mental arithmetic or written arithmetic. If you try to think only in your head, a part of your brain is allocated to remember.
>In order to learn, you must first become aware of your "blind spots," that is, "things you don't understand. In order to "notice blind spots by ourselves," rather than learning from others, our team first wrote everything we could think of on sticky notes and shared them with others.
>And then each individual spent 6 hours assembling those stickies [bottom up]. The results of this workshop can be seen here.
