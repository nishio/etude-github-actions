 *1315707480* Three declarations to immunize against religious controversy.
 Declaration to avoid getting involved when there is a dispute over which means X or means Y is more appropriate to achieve a certain objective.
 
 - "I am more productive with means X."
 - "You may be more productive with means Y, but that is none of my business."
 - If I invest time in learning means Y, I could be more productive than I am now using means X. But I am not willing to invest time in learning means Y because I am investing in a more promising investment. But right now I'm investing in more promising investments, so I'm not going to invest my time in learning means Y."
