[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
I'd like to organize what it would be like to create a task-organizing version of the [nishio.icon] listening chat system.
What kind of chat system is [nisbot.icon] that?
[nishio.icon]As you ask questions and dig into keywords, if you use it to organize tasks as is, you'll only dig into one task.
[nisbot.icon]What type of task is that?
[nishio.icon]There are two states, first, it is beneficial to have this system specifically verbalize the things that are in the mind with the blurring that has not yet been verbalized. I think what doesn't work is taking care of the state where there are multiple verbalized things and you can't prioritize them.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of blur is that blur?
[nishio.icon]State that something should be done, but it is not clear what.
[nisbot.icon]What type of condition is that?
[nishio.icon]NGKW Status.

 Is there anything else you would like to share about this chat system?
[nishio.icon]If we consider a different form of the current listening scenario, we can see what we have in common and what we don't and make improvements.
[nisbot.icon]What type of scenario is that?
In the [nishio.icon] elicitation scenario, repeat the question on the words that seem important to encourage concretization, then check what they value, and then ask about the relationship between the symbols that have been concretized.
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about that scenario?
[nishio.icon]I'm wondering if it would be possible to create another pattern for that scenario. If it were task management, I would first have them write down everything that comes to mind, and then ask, "Is this feasible now?" What do we need to do to make it feasible? and "What do I need to do to make this feasible?
[nisbot.icon]Where is that scenario?
[nishio.icon]Not yet. It's in a state of fuzziness in my brain.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]With multiple tasks on the task list and wondering which one to do first, I'm thinking that if I can verbalize which one to do first by talking to the chat system, I can do the task without worrying.
[nisbot.icon]What is that chat system like?
[nishio.icon]It's the coach. There's a lot of training that you might want to do, and having a coach say, "Okay, let's do this next time," reduces bias and oversight.

 Where can I find this chat system?
[nishio.icon]It would be nice to have a coach like that on your phone and be able to talk to him whenever you want.

 How do you know this chat system?
[nishio.icon]I don't know what to do.

 What should happen with this chat system?
[nishio.icon]There needs to be more language about what kind of scenarios would be useful for task management if they could be realized.
[nisbot.icon] What would need to happen in that scenario?
[nishio.icon]Need to be more specific and verbalize what questions to ask in what situations.
[nisbot.icon]Can that languageization do it?
[nishio.icon]If we do this kind of dialogue several times over time, it will gradually become more verbal.
[nisbot.icon]What type of verbalization is that?
