 The gripping tool on the left is reminiscent of a hacksaw pulling out a cavity.

 Wow, only 40 minutes left of today.

 Gee, the file name to save is not A-small.in but A-small-attempt0.in! I'm trapped! And I can't specify the location of the source file in advance because the submit form doesn't appear until I press the download button!

 I thought C was just a calculation, but then I realized that the division of cases for that calculation was troublesome, so I changed it to A and SUBMIT anyway. the smaller one resulted as correct, but I won't know the result of the larger one until the end of the contest.
 
 I was a little afraid of operational errors with a time limit of 4 or 8 minutes, including human operations,

 Hmmm, it takes less than a second to process, so there is plenty of time. However, this means that human operation is the bottleneck rather than the program.

 B missed SMALL twice by (for reasons that would be against the rules to write about since the contest is not yet over).

 I guess because it's a qualifier, it's not a "speed problem in LL". This was also a LARGE input, but it was instantaneous.

 By the way, for a programmer like me who loves to explain things to others, it is very stressful to have a gag order against talking. I think it's a systemic problem, but I'd rather run a short distance like TopCoder's SRM and have a good time after the race is over. But the ability to think carefully is also important. I still think it would be better to have "discussion but no code sharing" like ICFP PC.

 I want to solve C, but I'm too sleepy. I have already made a function to find the area of a part of a circle, so I think I can solve it if I can do the simple division of cases without making mistakes...but...no, I'm very sleepy. I'd better go to bed.
