Prisoner Training 2019 Review
[Prisoner Training] 2019 Review
>There is nothing in the training of the abdominal muscles that involves lying down and raising the upper body, as one might imagine under the name "sit-ups."
>Lift the side of your knee.
This is because we often raise our legs in our daily activities, whereas the movement of the upper body is not so much

> Impressions one month after starting. The task is easy enough to continue. And you can feel the growth.
> The first day of step 1 push ups I was like, "Is this so easy, just 10 repetitions?" I felt.
> So the next week I tried intermediate 25x2 instead of beginner 10x1. But after about 20 times I was having a pretty hard time and couldn't do a second set.
> This "number of times I can do it" grew a little bit each week, and now, after a month, I can do 150 times 50x3!
> Low load allows the mind to observe one's own body.
> Currently I have more problems with my right shoulder joint than with my lack of arm muscles.
After 9 months
	push up
		Step 2 40x3 is ready.
		Looks like we can try step 3.

	pull-up (e.g. resistor)
		Step 2 40x3 is ready.
		I had a hard time finding a bar of the right height.
		Angles are loosened according to the book's instructions.
		ã€€I can now do 30 and will do it rapidly in the future.

	leg raise
		The frequency hasn't increased.
		My back hurts when I try to increase the frequency.
		My wife examined me and the form looks bad.
		Maybe I was unconsciously avoiding it because it pulls when I take the correct starting position.

	[Squatting]
		My torso is now stretched.
		The frequency hasn't increased.

		Maybe we should do some reinforcement training on p. 303.
			Do just one rep every day.
