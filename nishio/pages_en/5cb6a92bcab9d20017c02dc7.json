What is stability?
>I've been told that I am the opposite of stable, but I think stability in my mind means that even if I don't find it worthwhile to live in Japan tomorrow, I can survive until the day after tomorrow when I am offered a job overseas.

Perhaps a few decades ago, many people considered "belonging to a large company" to be "stable. However, today's young people know about management failures and large-scale restructuring before they start working. They know that large companies will not survive. Therefore, the idea of "stability" is changing.

People who have always thought that "big companies are stable" and have made choices based on that belief may have a hard time believing that [cognitive dissonance] has changed their situation. There is a [normalcy bias] that the company they belong to will not go bankrupt and that they will not be restructured.

I was born in 1981, and at this point in my life, I feel that "a situation in which one's source of income is 100% dependent on one economic entity is unstable, because if that economic entity collapses, you will go with it," and this means that "depending on only one company is unstable. Therefore, I don't get along with people who think that "belonging to a large company will bring stability.
