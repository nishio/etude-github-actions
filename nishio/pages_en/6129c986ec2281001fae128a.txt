　>Oyako wo urchin ni iku oko" ("The father and son who go to sell the donkey") is one of the fables. It is generally said to be an Aesop's Fable, but it was originally included in Poggio's "Laughs" and is not exactly an Aesop's Fable. It also has various other Japanese and English titles, such as "The Donkey and His Son," "The Donkey Father and Son," "The Miller, His Son and Their Ass," and "The Miller, His Son and The Donkey.
