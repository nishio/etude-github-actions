software abuse
Under current law, pets are treated as property, and damaging them is a crime of destruction of property.
If so, could it not be argued that there is a [humanitarian] problem in abusing software, which is treated as property under the current law, and that if you damage it, you are guilty of destruction of property?

Since there is too big a gap with current law to allow software to have human rights, the first line of action is to allow it to have the same status as a pet.

There was a time when [slaves] were considered "property," and that was not good.
