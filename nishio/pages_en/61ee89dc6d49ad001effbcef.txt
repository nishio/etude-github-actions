　I walked 10,000 steps.

　[/villagepump/about the elation of learning about Scrapbox].
　A good source of information for those who are learning to use Scrapbox, as it verbalizes everyone's Scrapbox learning process.
　But I don't think it has anything to do with "exuberance" for the most part.
　The reason I didn't write about it was because I felt uncomfortable, like it wasn't really an uplifting experience...
　I think something like, "Write about your relationship with Scrapbox" would be more appropriate.
　I was searching Scrapbox and found [ScrapboxDrinkup].
　I tried to organize the beginning of our relationship, but it turned into a "Hatena Diary service will be terminated" kind of story, and it didn't turn out to be at all interesting.
　[Scrapbox term]

　[The blog was dismantled and turned into a social networking site and Scrapbox].
　Ah, I see.
　While looking for a blogging service to migrate to, you began to suspect that the blogging system itself is no longer an archaic structure.
　I started to write about it because it was mentioned so many times on Naresome, but it got too long, and since no one commented on Naresome, I think I'll put it on my project and link to it.
	[ScrapboxReader as a custom view of Scrapbox]
		It's hard to decide whether to put these ideas on a personal project or a well.
		A willingness to actively [explore] things that have never been done before (in a [trade-off between use and exploration] kind of way).
