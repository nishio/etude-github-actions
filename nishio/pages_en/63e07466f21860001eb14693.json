The story is that the Sanskrit in the Buddhist scriptures he studies (8th century) tends to have rounded letters because they are written on leaves (paper made from leaves). This is because vertical lines are difficult to write on surfaces with many vertical fibers. It is an interesting story that "the medium (paper) defines the shape of the letters.

Apparently (because the composition of the leaves, the material of paper, changes depending on the climate zone). I imagine that the relationship between parchment and pen, or between Japanese paper and brush, is actually similar, i.e., the type of paper (composition, fibers) determines the writing style, writing order, and shape of letters, which is a more universal phenomenon than one might think.

[Cuneiform is also expressed by pressing a stick into clay, so it's a set of cuneiforms.

The reason I am making [Kozaneba, a digital stationery for organizing thoughts] is that I believe that different stationery makes it easier or harder to [express], and that the harder expressions are avoided and the easier ones are biased, which in turn influences our thinking.
