Keicho-Mattermost State Transitions
	(7/2019) Current State Transition
		State 1
			If the number of key phrases exceeds 10, double the score of the highest scoring one and go to state 2
				That we "chose keywords to focus on."
				[Condition of Transition]
					Now I'm simply looking at the number of key phrases, but it should be the number of those that exceed paramA (the line that prioritizes questions that don't take keywords).
			　I'm fiddling with the score to keep it in focus, but is that appropriate? Would it be better to make a "list of words in focus"?
			　[Score=development, not attention].
		State 2
			If key phrases exceed 30, go to 21.
			Maybe this should really be "more than a few well-developed symbols".
		State 21
			Question #22.
				NoArgQuestion("What do you value?")
			Double the score for words included in the answer.
			Go to state 3.
		No particular change from state 3.
			There should be a transition to exit preparation
				[End design].
