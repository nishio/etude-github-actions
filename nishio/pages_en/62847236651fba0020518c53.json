If you keep talking about it, your memory will be tampered with.
>[https://twitter.com/kikumaco/status/1526423348376309760?s=21&t=RYCf-0hmkvqM0I7KjqgxkA @kikumaco]: if you keep talking about your experience, [memory] gets falsified. When there is an audience, the danger is very great. It turns more and more into a story that is "received." This can't be helped. Human memory is unreliable.
>I am consistently critical of the "[storytelling]" approach. Because the memory of the teller changes.

Experience should be in [text format] while it's fresh.
