ref and useEffect
[https://gyazo.com/9a294a69bcfc79a07aa38d51b4722ef8]

ã€€The second stage is the generation of the DOM. It takes place after the function component has finished executing its function. useEffect is called after it has finished.

code:ts
 const MyComponent: React.FC<{}> = () => {
   console.log("function body")
   const [, setX] = useState({});
   const ref = useRef(null);
   console.log("ref.current", ref.current);
   useEffect(() => {
     console.log("useEffect")
   })
   const onClick = () => {
     console.log("onClick");
     setX({});
   }
   return <div ref={ref}>
     <button onClick={onClick}>redraw!</button>
   </div>
 }
