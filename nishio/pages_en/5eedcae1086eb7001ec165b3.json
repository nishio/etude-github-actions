	The use of yield in a closure is unsupported.
		NG: ` dist = min(distances[(goal, dir)] for dir in range(4))`

	`Untyped global name 'input': cannot determine Numba type of ...`
	 input is of unknown type and cannot be used, so read it and then pass it to the compiled function.

 You can't use defaultdict in NUMBA.
 	I tried to use dict, but I get type errors related to get.
 	To begin with, if you use a tuple as a key, it's a type error, so you need to pack it into an integer.
 	→Then let's be honest and use an array.
