A large blurry mass is pulled into line and disintegrates.
from [KJ method study group @ Loftwork pre-map comments].
　People who have trouble organizing groups tend to create a big blurry mass of many labels just gathered in one place.
　Such a mass is likely to be either
　　The nameplate is very abstract.
　　　It's a mass of things that were originally abstract concepts that you had, and then you unconsciously used them to collect things that fit into those concepts.
　　I can't put a nameplate on it.
　　　It's all about what's in it.
　If a line connects to label X in that clump, then shrinking that line will break up the larger clump.
　　Is it ok to just tear off X. Are there labels that want to follow X?
　　A pair that resists being torn apart shows that there is a line between them.
