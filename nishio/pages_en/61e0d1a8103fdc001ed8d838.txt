Kozaneba:thing
Logs experimenting with a new approach to reading against Heidegger's ["Things"].

from [Kozaneba:dwell-think]
Kozaneba:thing
In [Kozaneba: On the Phenomenology of Language], we first proceeded verbatim from the beginning of the text.
Then I decided to chop it up into sentence or phrase units and further refine it as needed.
　Because if you chop it up into small pieces from the beginning, the particles will stand out.

We don't do it verbatim in this experiment.
　This is simply because I'm busy tomorrow and not in a state to take the time to read philosophy books.
　This "slow reading" is "chopped and arrayed on Kozaneba", so a PC is required.

So here we do the symbol extraction first.

What is involved

There's a little bit of a glazed look in his eyes.
Writing while reading skips some German and Latin words, but I guess that's an important lead-in that shouldn't be skipped.

It is possible to slow down for a "feeling of understanding," but that defeats the purpose of the experiment.
It is only a judgment of "whether it is a symbol or not", and it is not important whether you understand the meaning of the symbol at the moment or not

At first I didn't really understand, so I just picked up symbols, but after 6 minutes of organizing in Kozaneba, I understood a little (= found relationships between symbols), which made me greedy!

What is "greed" here?
[the desire to understand].
It's a desire for a sense of understanding, and when it's strong, we jump to shallow understandings that are easy to get.
Deep understanding is not readily available.
