Why you started and your goals at each point in time
　(I saw a "I just started trying to be red for now" type of topic on Twitter [12/22/2020 https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1341351263963738112?s=21])
  I'm talking about what my goal was. At first, it was "there are a lot of people around me who are doing atcoder, so I'll give it a try anyway.
  After I did it, I heard, "You have to do it about 10 times or it will come out much lower than your true ability," and I said, "Well, let's do it 10 times."
  And 10 times later, three months later, I was in the middle of the green, and I was thinking, "I hope it's light blue."
 　After another three months of light blue from there, I thought I'd lost sight of my goal and was going to lose my tension.
 　is unexpectedly up to the blue eye, so the current goal is to make it blue anyway.
 　I also want to make PAST advanced. I'm thinking that once I'm done with those two things, I'll be less excited again.
