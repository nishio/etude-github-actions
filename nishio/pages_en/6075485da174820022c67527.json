What we made
　[✅Create an empathic lighting mode.]
　[✅Create a look-back support mode].
　[✅Make proposal support mode].

way of making
　First we need to formulate the question.
　　[The first question should be made with the expectation that it will go in the title of the log].
　What to do on the client side
　　Determine the key for mode identification
　　wrinkle out the first question by mode
　What to do on the server side
　　Import and register modules at the beginning of the media iterator in specialized mode and let it do the details for you.
　　Various definitions in individual modules
　　The state and question IDs are global values, but there is no need to save the range of IDs, and it would be troublesome if there were collisions, so we can reserve 100 or so and treat them locally by relative position from the first offset.
