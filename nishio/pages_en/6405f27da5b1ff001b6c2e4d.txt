 I think each of the three is a different capability.
 　A: Start something new where there is nothing.
 　B: Pouring energy into one theme and expanding it
 　C: Finding a connection between two things
 I'm a little low on B = [bored].
 　I'm not particularly conscious of the C's, but I'm consciously increasing the A's.
 　So it must be C>A>B.
	Interesting analysis[/villagepump/inajob.icon][/villagepump/sta.icon].
		I might not be good at A myself.
			I feel like I'm getting A's through marriage, child rearing, etc.
			Do people influence you?
		B is good at... I can't say I'm good at it, but I might tend to do the same thing all the time.
			This is the metaphor for spreading the stain in the first place, and this is what you're consciously doing.
		C is not conscious.

	ABC's.
		A>B>C, I guess.
		A is something I'm consciously working on.
			but[/villagepump/nishio.icon][/villagepump/inajob.icon]not as much footwork as you two!
		B is the best at feeling, but it's clumsy and becomes "not expansive enough for the time spent" or "stuck".
		I am not good at C. I'm not good at situations that require me to think about connecting or applying two things.
			Probably not suited to their characteristics.
			[/sta] I'm consciously trying to do this with my own scbo, but what a feeling of being left to my own devices. Or I am forcibly expanding two things that I see for the time being.

 It's interesting to see the three sides of the story.
