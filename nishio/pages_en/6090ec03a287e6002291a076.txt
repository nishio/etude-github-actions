 *1267594815*[Kaizen] Benefit of putting small documents in clear folders.
 When I tried to dry the laundry, I broke down a pile of papers and scattered them out the window.
 
 Fortunately, since everything was in a clear folder, it only fell down solely. The only damage was that one clear folder was broken.
 
 I shudder to think what would have happened if the documents had been loaded with fine flimsy pieces of paper.
