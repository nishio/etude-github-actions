(6.1)  "To come up with ideas" is ambiguous and a big task
Suppose you need to come up with a new idea by tomorrow. What will you do first? Do you sit at the desk and wait for ideas to come up?

The task of "to come up with an idea" is a big task. Its achievement conditions are unclear. It is difficult to estimate the time. There is no method to come up with ideas surely. Treating such a task as a big task is inefficient.

We learned how to handle a big task in [(2.3.1) Task is too big]. We need to split the task into small parts. After splitting, some phases can be measured and managed.
