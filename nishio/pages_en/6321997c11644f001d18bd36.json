The "function that redraws only the unmasked areas" is a crude explanation for the general public.
	It's not a "don't change anything that's masked, just make the rest of it so that the boundaries add up."
	If you zoom in, you can see the changing mesh pattern on the masked bench.

	It is natural that the masked area will also change, because there is not enough dimension in the latent space to hold that detailed information.
 Even if there were no mask and no noise, the image would still be shaky because it's being restored from one-sixteenth of the information content.
