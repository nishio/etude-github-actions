[Strongly supervised memory network]

Memory addition: [$ m_N \leftarrow x ]
Memory retrieval:.
[$ o_1 = \mathrm{argmax}_i S_O(x, m_i) ]
[$ o_2 = \mathrm{argmax}_i S_O((x, m_{o_1}, m_i) ]
	Isn't [nishio.icon]this form not guaranteed [$ o1\neq o2]?
[$ r = \mathrm{argmax}_{w\in \mathcal{V}} S_R((x, m_{o_1}, m_{o_2}), w)]

SO and SR, respectively.
[$ s(x,y) = \Phi(X)^T \; U^T \; U \; \Phi(y)]
[$ \Phi] is embedded in the D dimension
The real problem is whether or not we can prepare the teacher data necessary for the training of SO and SR.
