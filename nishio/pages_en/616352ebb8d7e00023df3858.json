The concept that the word refers to expands and contracts and becomes something else.

[In the story "Masakari 2," I thought that the transition of the meaning of the word "Masakari" had the same composition as "Just kidding X," but it was difficult to convey the similarities when reading the text, so I drew the picture.

 Time 1: Mr. 1 ties the word A to some concept X.
 Time 2: Concept X is expanded, and Mr. 2 refers to the expanded concept Y as A.
 Time 3
  A person named A appears, referring to part Z of the expanded concept (Mr. 3).
  Mr. 4, who sees that Mr. 3's statement and doesn't know about X and Y, starts to think "A=Z".
 Time 4: Mr. 4 and Mr. 1 have different concepts of what word A refers to, and they are not talking about the same thing.
