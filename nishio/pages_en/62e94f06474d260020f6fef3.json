I went to the dentist.
　The difficulty in flossing the back teeth.
　　They say the interdental spaces aren't a nice shape to begin with because the teeth are growing in crookedly.
　　So it's hard to floss through, and even if you do, it's hard to get it clean.
　　Shape the interdental spaces themselves to allow interdental brushes to pass through.
　　The wire is too thick to pass through ordinary ones.
