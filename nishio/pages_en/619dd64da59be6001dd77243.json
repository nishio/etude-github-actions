Does the hawk that knows best hide its talons in modern times?
Is it that even today, "[a capable hawk] hides its talons," that is, "it is [incompetent] not to hide its talons," or is it that "a capable hawk hides its talons" itself is an archaic idea that has not adapted to the changing times, and it is incompetent to think that way nowadays?
