>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1640274967765065729] I was thinking about Sam Altman's [American Equity], and the problem he's concerned about will happen, and most people in the existing state actually If you don't believe in their occurrence until they happen, and the problems occur before the measures he proposes are realized, then the only thing you can do is [run away] with the people who know what they're doing.

>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1640275685016227841] seriously this is it!

>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1640275829321256960] I think it's also true that [effective altruism]-like ideology doesn't catch on at all. The problem is that only the smart people understand it.

>[0xtkgshn https://twitter.com/0xtkgshn/status/1640275980664336386] and I'm suffering from a [categorical imperative] kind of pain, like whether it's okay for smart people to just run away.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1640284460532002816] [Atlas] We're talking about whether or not [Atlas] will continue to support the celestial sphere, but since Atlas is not a god, but a life-size human being, if he can afford it, he will support it, but if he can't afford it, he won't support it. If he can afford it, he will support it, but if he can't afford it, he won't support it.
 [Atlas, which happens to have room, holds up the celestial sphere].

[It's agrarian bias to blame escape]
	→[social networking sites that keep running away] →[move the good stuff].
	→[people on the move connect people who settle down] →[after the world is torn apart].
