 If many people have a negative image of the words "in the making" and "in the writing", I wonder if it would be better to call it "[continuous improvement]" or something like that.
 Books were to be "written, distributed, and read.
  The writing and reading phases were clearly separated.
  It is the [material] tether of paper.
  The [information transmission medium] of paper books was a great success at one point in human history.
  This allowed the same content to be created in the same way when media without [paper ties] was subsequently created.
 The same has long been true in program development.
  The phases of making and using were clearly separated.
  Later the idea of "[agile] development" emerged.
  Instead of separating the phases of making and using, they proceed gradually in parallel.
  When you start using the software, you learn. You find things you want to improve.
  Separating the making phase from the using phase would be making without this learning.
   [Learning-oriented management].
  It's not "in the making," but rather "trying to learn from [user testing] at an early stage.
 A negative term for a software project that is not "in the making" can be "a dead project that has not been maintained.
 	The surrounding environment is constantly changing, and any product will become [obsolete] if it is not continuously [maintained].
   [Market fit] will decline.
   [technical debt] in the original sense.
  The idea that a "finished" product that is no longer continually maintained is considered "dead" because it has stopped [metabolizing].
  　[完成=死]
  From [industrial product metaphor] to [biological metaphor] # even if
