System is a knowledge network that can be raised or lowered in abstraction.

[knowledge network] with [system] = [consistency].
[What constitutes systematic?]
　[/unnamedcamp/nishio.icon]
　A mere list of fragments of knowledge is not [systematic].
　A link between them brings us closer to the system.
　　Linkage is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
　　　For example, how about a daily diary linked to the previous day, the next day, and N years ago?
　　The link here is not only digital, but also in the brain [associative link].
　　Associative links come together to form [a network of associations].
　You can follow links [that allow you to go up and down in abstraction] and move fast within the network.
　　The [skip list] principle (metaphor not conveyed)
　　When you see a concrete example, you can immediately associate it with "Oh, this is that pattern," and this is the link of association that raises the level of abstraction
　[Fast travel in the knowledge network reduces the time it takes to search for knowledge.
　The shorter time it takes to search improves the time to find useful knowledge for a given external situation and the probability of success.
　People around you describe this phenomenon as "smart," "idea man," "good at verbalization," etc.
　　And when I say that it's the result of learning, not innate, I'm talking about what's the difference compared to someone who has learned but can't do it.
　　That's where I say, "Because I learned it systematically."
