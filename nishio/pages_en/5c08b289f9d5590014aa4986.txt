	>I happened to see http://dutoit6.com/183 that just now came through and thought, well, there are "want to do" types and "[want to be]" types, and the "I want to be someone who can program/understand machine learning" types don't have anything they want to do.
 >If you want to be "a person who can do it," there are many programming/machine learning courses available online, and you can take them and say, "I am a person who completed this course. and they can't find an option because they are trying to fulfill both objectives at the same time.
