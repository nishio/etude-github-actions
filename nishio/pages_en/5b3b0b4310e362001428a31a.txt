person who disturbs (e.g. someone's peace)
 The concept of a "person who disturbs harmony."
 When there is trouble in [team management], the cause is not a specific individual, but the whole team.
 Labeling and ostracizing a particular individual as a "peacemaker" may seem to solve the problem in the short term, but it only distracts from the true nature of the problem, and is an action that will lead away from a solution in the long term.
