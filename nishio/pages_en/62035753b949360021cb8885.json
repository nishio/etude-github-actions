(7.2.4.3) An example Strategy for new employees
I introduced the components of various strategies. The real strategy is created by combining these abstract components and the real environment. Let's consider the strategy for a fictitious concrete environment here.

Suppose you graduated from college and become a new employee of a software company this year. You are in a position to receive freshman training. This is the position you are in now. There is no opportunity to receive a freshman training for an independent freelance. You can acquire knowledge efficiently by using this position.

On the other hand, knowledge of learned in the freshman training only produces low value. Because those knowledges are what everyone in the company knows. Those knowledge do not make difference at all. After the freshman training, you need to shift fields and pursue to excellence.

If you take the serial mastery strategy here, you will first learn some knowledge in field X through training of new employees and imitation of senior employees.
If you are rated acceptable, you will not further improve your knowledge in field X.
Invest your time in acquiring knowledge in the new field Y.

There are various choices on how to get the knowledge of the new field Y. For example, you say you like your grandmother very much and participate in volunteer group activities that solve the problems of aging society in that relationship. Members of the volunteer group have weak software knowledge. You can contribute to the volunteer group by using the knowledge of software. This is the excellence.

Through this volunteer activity, you acquire knowledge about the problem of aging society. This is knowledge that people in the company do not have. If you need a person who is familiar with the problem of an aging society in the company, you will gain a position of excellenec in the company as well.
