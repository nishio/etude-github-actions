ssh with ppk
 I was given a *.ppk file and told to use it to enter the server, but when I use ssh -i to specify it, it is in invalid format.
 Apparently pppk is a Putty format.
 Need to convert to openssh format [ref https://superuser.com/questions/232362/how-to-convert-ppk-key-to-openssh-key-under-linux]
	 `puttygen INPUTFILE.ppk -O private-openssh -o OUTPUTFILE`
