People who feel guilty about not
I believe that people who write "I don't X because of reason P" on social media are often just second-guessing and second-guessing their "I don't X", so if you deny "reason P", they will just say "I don't X because of reason Q".

The phrase "should X" might make you overreact because it seems like an attack to someone who thinks "not X" is backward.
