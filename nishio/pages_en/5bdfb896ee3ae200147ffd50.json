Resistance: Avalon
A [werewolf]-like game, no one is excluded from the game. Sequel to [Resistance].
[description https://inetility.com/resistance-avalon]

>"Avalon" is a game where you try your best to somehow make your project succeed with several bad guys mixed in with the players who are trying to make the project fail. The bad guys know each other and their friends. The rotating leader chooses the members of the project execution team from among the players, but you have to be careful to choose good people, because if you choose bad people, the project could fail. So everyone consults with each other about who would be a bad person, but of course there are several bad people mixed in with that "everyone," so they behave in a way that makes the good people look bad. This is another [bad organization].
> Suppose a good person expresses his or her opinion, to which another good person questions and refutes it. Inadvertently, those two good people assume each other that the other must be a bad person, and they start a [mud fight]. The really bad person watches [good people squashing each other] with a smirk on his/her face and sometimes adds fuel to the fire.
