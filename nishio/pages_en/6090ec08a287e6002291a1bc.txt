 *1316747398*Ten-fold speed image review method
 I was thinking about changing lifehack-related katakana words into chuunibu-like idioms, and this is how I described photo-reading yesterday: "I've been thinking about changing lifehack-related katakana words into chuunibu-like idioms.

 Step 1: Preparation, Step 2: "Pre-reading" to find "key words," Step 3: "Light reading," "de-stressing," entering the "high-speed learning mode," and reading the book in the "half-asleep view" after "assuring," Step 4: "Activation" by asking questions to the brain. Step 4 "Activation": Activate the brain by asking questions. This includes "post-reading," "dip-reading," and "rub-reading. Finally, it is recommended to perform the "mental projection technique.

 And then I thought, "It would be interesting to find out what it's called in Chinese"... Oh, so it's called shadow image review method! http://blog.roodo.com/rereading/archives/14920295.html
 
 It's cool that Affirmation is "ego-affirmation" and Activation is "activation". Mind Map is "mind map". Super reading, dipping, skittering. Not so good for the state of the focus (soft focus) of the perturbed image?
 
 Shadow Reading (Photo Reading) Procedure
 - I. Preparation
 -- A, set clear &#38321;reading objectives
 -- B, enter the ideal learning state. Mentally concentrated state of flow = Tangerine Concentration Method
  
 - 2. Deposit study (preparatory study)
 -- A, Survey
 -- B, find 關鍵語句(Keyword)
 -- C. Reexamine whether it is worth reading
  
 - 3, Shadow image&#38321;reading (photo reading)
 -- A, 1. Clearly defined objectives, 2. Concentrated breathing.
 -- B, become a fast learning model
 -- C, ego-affirmation (affirmation)
 -- Ding, tachibana concentration method, blip-page appearance, focal state of perturbation (soft focus)
 -- Boshi, paging through the pages with the thought of radiating out.
 -- I, clearly declare my ego-affirmation
 - Activation
 -- Kou, rest
 -- B. Ask questions to the brain.
 -- C, super&#38321;reading (super-reading) and dipping (dipping). Sweep the lines and rows. Re-read the part of interest according to your intuition. Find answers to questions.
 -- Ding, skittering may be used instead of reading and skitters. Skitering is to read the beginning of a paragraph using the rapid and irregular activity of the eye-fire, to skit the middle of the paragraph, and then to read the end of the paragraph again.
 -- Bosh, make a mind map.
 - V. High-speed&#38321;reading
 -- Kou, read the whole book from beginning to end in one gulp.
 
 So I'll explain photo reading in one tweet for the Japanese.

 The explanation of the whole-brain method of light reading: 1. Preparation: Setting up the purpose of reading, concentrating on the tachibana-tree method → ¡°pursuit¡± 2. Preparation: Searching for key words, reviewing reading value, 3.

 I'm amazed at the Chinese characters' ability to compress. Maybe you should write mind maps or leverage memos in Chinese?
