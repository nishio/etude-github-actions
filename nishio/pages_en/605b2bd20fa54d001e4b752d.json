[ScratchExtensionCode]
	I was able to read the code I wrote in Scrapbox via the API from http://sheeptester.github.io.
	I was wondering if it would be okay to read http resources from https services, since modern browsers block it, but it's localhost. It worked fine that way.
	As far as doing it alone, it would be easier to serve on localhost because you can try it out as soon as you rewrite it in the editor.
	If you have multiple people working on it, or if you want people who can't set up a server to use it, you can put it in Scrapbox for collaborative editing and Scrapbox will do the distribution for you.
