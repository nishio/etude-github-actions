　1 year ago
 　A page with only links to articles that I found interesting
 　　And there's a typo in the title.
 　　It was interesting to read it again, so I wrote a few thoughts and linked to related ones
 　Technical Memo
 　　Title lacks information, so add, add link, and specify date and time of experiment.
 　Notes on relevant pages in an attempt to explain what was experienced.
 　　I was going to explain it in detail, but it got tedious.
 　　I only wrote the important parts.
 n years ago
 　I wrote 12 years ago about something related to what was recently discussed.
 　　Cut out and title
 　I saw the article and thought, well, I've talked about that on Twitter recently.
 　　I thought I'd just post the URL without the title and summarize it later.
 　　Summary.
 　　I searched for keywords and found relevant pages.
 　　They linked up.
