change the world
There are two types of people: Person A who recognizes that "I can change the world," and Person B who recognizes that "I can't change the world.

This is a difference in perception of "change" rather than ability.

For example, let's say Mr. A picked up a piece of trash on the floor and put it in a trash can.

From Mr. A's perspective, this is of course "changing the world.
　Because the state is different before and after the action.
　They "changed the world for the better" because they thought and acted on the idea that "the world would be better off without all the garbage on it."

For Mr. A, this level of "changing the world" is something he does on a daily basis
　So every once in a while, "Today we changed the world!" I don't say.
　Mr. A accumulates [successful experiences] on a daily basis that he was able to change the world.
　　That's what pushes us to take on more difficult challenges.
　　It is a basis for not negating one's self-worth when difficult challenges fail.
　　 Because they have succeeded so many times, failure is perceived as "I just happened to fail this time.

Mr. B, on the other hand, recognizes that this is not changing the world.
　They perceive "changing the world" as something bigger and better, something they can brag about to everyone around them when they achieve it.
　　Vague and large, with no next action in sight.
　　Or the goal is so far away that I can't stay motivated until I get there.
　　[The disease of seeking great results from the start.]

They believe they cannot change the world and do not act.
　I can't start because I can't see the next action.
　Or the goal is too far away to reach.

Trying something difficult and failing to achieve great results from the start
　And it reinforces the negative belief, "See, I knew I couldn't change the world.
　[learned helplessness].
