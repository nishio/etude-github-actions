Easy to clean up and make a mess
	I can foresee the mess.
 So it's easy to clean up and make a mess.

	I can foresee the mess.
 	Busy, unmotivated, time-attack jobs, no time to organize.
 So it's easy to clean up and make a mess.
  Get a little creative with the clutter for when you clean up in the future.
  	Example
				Put the date in the file name and keep the date format consistent.
 	  Add "â˜…" at the beginning of the file name for easy searching.
  	 When you take your clothes off and throw them around the bed instead of all over the house, you only have to look around the bed when you clean up.

	Set rules when you're not busy.
		When you're busy and you think, "Oh, I should have standardized the date format," write that down.
  Make a note of what you find distressing and think about how to deal with it when you're not busy.

	Integrity is required.
 	If you're doing it all over and then going on to the next, you're not getting the findings.
