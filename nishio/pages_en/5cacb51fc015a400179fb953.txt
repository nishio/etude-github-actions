Mr. Mada and Scrapbox
	At [ScrapboxSQUARE#2], I forgot what prompted me to talk about [Takaaki Umada], and he told me that he had had a conversation with me at Scrapbox.
		[Loose contact points and knowledge sharing to foster culture in startups - - Conversation: Takaaki Umada, Hongo Tech Garage, University of Tokyo & Tomoji Nagasawa, Scrapbox https://medium.com/@scrapbox/ nagasawa-umada-116653e71b6b]

>Umada: I myself use nouns such as industry names as tags, but I think one direction is to take the approach of basing connections on the relevance and similarity of predicates and verbs. Inevitably [people tend to tag what they can see], but I think it would be good to tag what Christensen calls [jobs]. If the connections between jobs are visualized, we may be able to notice, "Oh, there are other jobs and issues like this here.

Oh, this has to do with [actively bracketing the verb].

[Christensen] focused on [job-to-be-done] ([errands to be taken care of]).
This is not much new, but what was discussed in "[Sell Holes, Not Drills]".
