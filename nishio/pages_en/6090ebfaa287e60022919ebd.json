 *1222749210*Remaining balance
 After entering the restaurant and ordering lunch, I was in a hurry when I remembered that I only had 400 yen in my wallet.
 
 If I remember after I eat it, will the police take care of me?
 
 *1222788561* just noticed
 It was a big&#22099; day before yesterday or so that I said "Halloween is coming soon" or something like that.

 <body>In my experience, there have been cases where <br>(1) I was asked to wait a bit for the payment and go to a nearby bank to withdraw the money<br>(2) I was told "another time will be fine", but ran to the ATM in the convenience store across the street<br>. <br><br>This was in Kyoto. <br>I remember thinking that they were surprisingly kind. </body><br><br
