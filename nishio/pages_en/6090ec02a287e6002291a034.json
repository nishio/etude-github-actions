 Why not just stick Sunshine Ranch on iKnow?

 I think iKnow, Sunshine Ranch, Love Plus and Wii Fit should be attached.
 
 *1257832576*自覚症状
 - Gum peeling. Periodontal disease?
 - My back hurts, my knees hurt too. Is it because I've been walking around with heavy bags?
 - I have some kind of severe dry eye.
 - It's cold, you think it's cold, you put on heavy clothes, then it gets hot and you take them off again.
 - Sluggish, sleepy
 
 →Take body temperature → 39.4 degrees Celsius → What the heck!
 
 So I took Tamiflu and slept the whole time...my body is hotter now that it's down to 36 degrees.... I thought my fever might have gone up, so I took my temperature again and again, and it stayed in the 36 degree Celsius range. I am reporting that there are cases of fevers with no subjective symptoms. Whether you are aware of it or not is subjective.

 Is this what you want to do?
 
 What, I was told that Japanese iTunes can't handle it.

 Is this still not good enough?

 I'd be OK with this.

 Yes, this is OK, I can put this on the international page.
