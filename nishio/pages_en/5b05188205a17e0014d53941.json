Try the Scrapbox API
	/api/pages/<project_name>
 	CREATED, etc. contains integers.
  	It's supposed to be unixtime in seconds.
   [Date - JavaScript | MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date]
   Multiply by 1000 and `new Date(x * 1000)` to get the date and time.
  You can get it even if you are not logged in.
  	Then what's the value of ACCESSED...
	`No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`
		Oh, it's only accepting access from scrapbox.io?

 [Experiment to change the sort order in Scrapbox].
