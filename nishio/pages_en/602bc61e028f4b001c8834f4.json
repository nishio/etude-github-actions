Recessed studs - Open studs - T-pipe
[https://gyazo.com/4a64d6c337217edf2aaafbdcc08097b9]

Some blocks, such as [Technique Block 1 x 2 - Pin Hole 1] and [Center Stud], have recessed studs (we will call these [recessed studs]).
By overlapping this with an [open stud] such as [Plate 1 x 1 - Round Open Stud] which has a hole through it, you can stick a [T-pipe] straight through.
