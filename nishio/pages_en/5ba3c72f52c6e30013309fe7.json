The fallacy of using the scientific method to make business decisions
	Science tries to get [universal knowledge
 Therefore, we tend to try to collect a sufficient [sample size
 There is a 95% probability that this [hypothesis] is correct!"
 In business, it doesn't matter whether it's 96% or 94%.
 Even if the hypothesis has a 10% chance of being correct.
 If the [expected profit] from it exceeds the cost, then "[it's] a good bet."
 Whether a bet is profitable or not and how much you will lose if you are unlucky ([loss limitation]) are important in business.
 Spending time and money on data collection in an attempt to increase the probability that a hypothesis is correct to 95% or more is basically a bad strategy.
 It is a mistake to confuse [business decision making] with procedures that are recognized as universal knowledge in science.
 #Decisions

The approach of taking the null hypothesis in the first place, calculating the p-value and making a GO decision if it's smaller than 0.05, has been criticized quite a bit.
see [p-value critique].
