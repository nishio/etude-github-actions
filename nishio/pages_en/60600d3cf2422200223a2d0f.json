 nishio: I think we should actively destroy voice conversations among three or more people, since they are inefficient and only a continuation of the evils of the pre-technological era.
 [suztomo https://twitter.com/suztomo/status/1375857637410099200]: I think it is most efficient to edit shared notes (Google Docs, Scrapbox) while talking with many people. It is more efficient than a one-on-one conversation because you can hear and read the opinions of many people at the same time. Shared notes allow people who are not talking to each other to add comments and can easily refer back to them later.


[Verbal communication disappears].
