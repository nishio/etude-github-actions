2022 Muscle Training: Understanding the Current Situation
2022-01-12
When I look at [2021 Muscle Training], it's as if we're not doing anything.
　You actually get to [full squat] in June.
　Scrapbox isn't the best way to keep track of muscle training.
　　What kind of shape would make it easier to put on...
　　Shouldn't be a link because making it a link will cause problems.
　　If the name and frequency of the exercise are on the same line, can we look back in the search?

When I went home to my parents' house and they said, "You don't exercise because you work from home," I had to try squats, and I realized again that [Prisoner Training] is still useful.

From understanding the current situation
　I bought a dangling stick, let's see when.
　Hanging Series
　　Memo p.47
　　　Shoulder squeeze p.148
　　　Elbows not extended straight
  status quo
  　Bar hang Beginner 1 set of 10 sec.
  　　I can do it a few times.
  　　Advanced 4 sets of 1 min.
 clutch flag
 　I guess you can't. I haven't tried.
 　Vertical bar required
　head
　　First of all, I can't bridge hold.
　trifecta
　　Basis is 20 seconds
　　Straight bridge hold 20 sec.
　　 It's hard, but not impossible.
　　 I thought you couldn't "put your hands on either side of your hip joints."
　　angled bridge hold
　　　Difficulty in finding a platform of adequate height in a condition that cannot be done well, beds are soft and uncomfortable
　　　They say putting your hands on either side of your head opens up your rib cage and relaxes your shoulders, but I think you're ticking over from your daily routine as a programmer.
　　　I'll try just hands without any load.
　　　　Sensation of being stretched in right arm.
　　　　It's not enough to put in the effort.
　　bent-leg hold
　　　I don't see a railing that's just the right width and height...
　　　Try it with a bathtub railing.
　　　Just in time for 10 seconds x 2
　　　Feeling of strain on the right arm
　　　Not enough to train the belly, which is the goal, and the arms are weak.
　　twist hold
　　　straight-leg twist hold
　　　　No problem.
　　　　Stimulation is felt in the left shoulder when turning right, and in the hip joint and right shoulder when turning left
 　　easy twist hold
 　　　No problem.
 　　　Hip joint problem when turning left.
 　　half twist hold
 　　　clockwise rotation
 　　　　Shoulders, "barely deflected".
 　　　counterclockwise rotation
 　　　　Hip and lower back, "barely touched" rather than "let it soften"
　　Push-up Series
　　　incline push-up
　　　Intermediate 20 x 2 or advanced 40 x 3.
　　　86 for kitchen, 75 for washbasin
　　　Maybe 20 is hard in the kitchen.
　　　Surprisingly, it wasn't so. As for the first 20, it wasn't too much of a burden.
　　　It's the right pectoral muscle that's not quite right.
　　squat
　　　Maybe I can do a full squat beginner 5 x 1 with my energy, but that's not a good way to do it.
　　　I don't think the beginner 8 x 1 half squat is a problem, it's more like 35 x 2 intermediate or 50 x 2 advanced.
　　　I just don't think the shoulder stand squat in step 1 can do the advanced 50 x 3
　　　　This reduces the load on the lower body, but uses the upper body instead, the theory being that the upper body is weak.
　　　　Of the whole, the squat is the farthest ahead, so I dare you to choose to do a shoulder stand properly.
　　　　Shoulder stand squats, how many can you do?
　　　　I think I can just about do 25 x 2 intermediate.
　　　　At first it's the neck, then after about 20 times it feels like the lower back.
　　　　In other words, the trunk is weak and no longer able to keep it "straight."
　　　　Hmmm, I better do this one, because the other ones that aren't doing well are generally due to a weak core.
　　Pull-up Series
　　　Vertical pulls can be done and there is no suitable desk for the next horizontal pull.
　　　Beyond that, you start hanging from the bar and you don't have the equipment at home.
　　　Iron bars are in the park.
　　　[Prisoner Training 202005#5ec79392aff09e000053f490]
　　　　Vertical pull can be done 120 times without rest and the load is too weak, increase the load and you can do 40 x 3 in the advanced level.
　　　　vertical
　　　So it's like going to the park bars and finding out if it's 10×1, 20×2, or 30×3.
　　　　I think it probably feels like it gets hard after about 15 times, so I think I'm aiming for intermediate.
　　　If it's hard, find something higher than hip height; if you can do 30, go back to hip height."
　　　　I think the bars are higher than the hip joints, so "weaker assignments."
 　Leg Raise Series
 　　I left it because my core was too weak to do the knee tuck on step 1.
 　　In the meantime, I could do a beginner 10 x 1.
 　　Trunk wobbly, level of pain in the lower back begins to hurt after 4 times.
 　Bridge Series
 　　short bridge
 　　I think you can do 10x1 but 25x2,50x3 is doubtful.
 　handstand push-up
 　　It says to learn push up step 6 (close push up) before starting step 1.
 　　Not for the time being.

[https://gyazo.com/1dafb3f58f53909c2049797d0a6c8aab]
Iron bar height 90,100,110
　Even the most expensive one was just shy of 10 times.
