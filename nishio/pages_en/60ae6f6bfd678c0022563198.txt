Motivated Reasoning
>Motivated reasoning: the unconscious tendency to use one's head only when the conclusion is consistent with one's preconceived goals. [May include "confirmation bias" or "my-side bias" (preferentially seeking and remembering information that is consistent with one's goals) and "non-confirmation bias" (a tendency to view evidence that is not consistent with one's goals with particular skepticism).
