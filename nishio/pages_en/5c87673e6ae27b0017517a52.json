Mistakes of the past
>I have to admit that I made a serious mistake in what I wrote in my first book.
[Wittgenstein] [Philosophical Investigations] p.11 Introduction

His "first book" is [Essays in Logic and Philosophy], written in 1918 and published in 1921.
It is believed that Philosophical Inquiry was roughly finished writing by 1946. Publication was posthumous.

As an example of how the author of a book's ideas are not immutable, I wrote in Column [(Column) Time Direction Reading] on p.125 of [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers], but I thought it would be better to be more specific.
