 If you look at it as a minor scale (like C↔Am), `3` becomes the [dominant], and if you make it `3~`, the semitone raised becomes the [conductor] to the root note of `6`, and if you make it `3~7`, it becomes the [tritone] ([triad]), which makes it more likely to progress to `6`.
	 Maybe that's why the chorus `6` from `3~[7]` in [Thesis of the Cruel Angel] sounds so pleasant.
 I have no idea, so I watched the video and messed around with InstaChord a bit and figured it out[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
  First of all, with InstaChord, it's usually displayed as [* C/Am].
  	Since 1 is C, this is a major scale
   At this time, 3 is Em and 6 is Am.
  　In the minor scale, Em is dominant and Am is tonic
   	In other words, going from 3 to 6 in a major scale is the equivalent of going from dominant to tonic in a minor scale.

 　  Compared to the major scale, the minor scale has a weaker dominant to tonic connection.
 　  　Because it's not moving in semitones relative to the base note of the tonic.
 　  3~ing in the C/Am state is to E the Em.
   　　Em becomes E, which means So becomes sharp.
   　　[Raise "so" a semitone]
   　3~→6 would be a semitone shift from So# to La
   　　Also, in the Seventh Chord, the Re is sounding, so the So# and Re make a tritone.

	[/villagepump/InstaChord's minor scale is the harmonic minor scale].
