Nada Special Tour

>For example, the story of the Nada Special Treatment Tour described in Episode II of Mr. Ota's book really made me think about a lot of things. If Nada Junior High School is a candidate for higher education, it is a necessary challenge, but if there are no plans to go on to higher education and the child is taking the test to win the "triple crown" (passing Nada, Kaisei, and Chikkoma), adults need to calmly judge how the test will affect our child and whether it is really necessary, before saying it is a special treatment or free of charge. I think it is necessary for adults to make a calm judgment about how the "Triple Crown" examination will affect my child and whether it is really necessary.

>To begin with, it is a great burden both mentally and physically for a child to go all the way to a distant place to challenge a difficult school before his/her main goal. It is up to each family to decide, but we must make sure that the child does not feel the expectations of the cram school or the intentions of the parents.

I didn't know this kind of thing was still done...
