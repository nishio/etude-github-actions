　Thoughts.
　　Count the number of moves until the sum exceeds x, the constraint violation penalty, 0.
　　When the violation points are independent, there is no other option but to reduce them by the amount of the penalty.
　　If consecutive, two penalties can be reduced at the same time
　　Best to reduce the two ends until the end is zero.
　　　It's only 2 less than the maximum.
　　So we can calculate the penalty in linear order and crush it from the end in linear order.
　Official Explanation
　　Same policy of filling in from the edges.
