Social proof of Scrapbox page
A [social proof] approach to the problem of not knowing which one to call when there are 10,000 pages, saying that "what others mention is what is worth mentioning".
　I don't think "others" is "all mankind."
　　Because they'll choose some juicy entertainment news or a fishing story that makes everyone want to say a few words.

Find links from other people's projects to your own

　A quick thought, "who has dozens of links."
　　It should be a more reliable link than someone who only links to one.
　　　Proof that this is not a first-time visitor who came in through social networking buzz.
　　In the first place, you're pretty much selected as an early adopter by being a "heavy Scrapbox user" compared to Twitter buzz and the like.

Search pages viewed by humans are ordered by new arrivals or PageRank, depending on settings.
　With the API, parameters can be used to determine which one to use.
　https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/sta/search/query?skip=0&sort=pageRank&limit=30&q=%2Fnishio
　Use this API to collect from multiple projects, bundle them together, and sort and display them in order of most mentions.
　　A set of mention links for each person is also included.
　　Looks interesting.

I'll show this to someone visiting the project for the first time, "How about this article for starters?" is that this is a good one.
　Or the author will further select from this list
　Because it is more likely to be "the seed of a useful discussion".
　The current Scrapbox, at least for this project of mine, sorted by PageRank, does not work at all as a "list of recommended pages to look at first".
　 Many pages do not function independently.
　　Most Viewed is better, but this is more "Twitter Buzz".
　　Would it be nice if something like "number of mentions across projects" existed as an official feature?
　　　No, well, but writing 10,000 pages by yourself is a use case far removed from the core of the official's expected use case.
　　　If it is used as groupware in an organization, should the "list of recommended pages for new team members to read" be maintained manually?
　　　Groupware for groups loosely connected by strong related interests without internal or external organizational boundaries
　　　 Associations [smooth society and its enemies].
