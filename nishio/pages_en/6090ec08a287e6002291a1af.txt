 *1315639450*Resolution: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libpng12.0.dylib
 I tried to use Matplotlib on my Mac and got this error and ImportError.
 
 According to https://trac.macports.org/wiki/ProblemHotlist, this is because libpng went from 1.2 to 1.4 and libpng12 was erased. I have to rebuild all binaries that use libpng to use libpng14. What a hassle.

 Do this for now and wait a few hours.
