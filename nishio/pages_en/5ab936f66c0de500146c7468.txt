Read a lot of books
You might think that "[studying]" by reading a lot of books is a good thing.
However, it is an action of making a degraded copy of "knowledge that has already been [verbalized] and circulated in the world" in your mind.
You are not generating knowledge for yourself, nor are you giving knowledge to others.
In terms of [knowledge must be proven by action], it is not producing results.
