Scrapbox personal icons should have no margins

I thought that only the robot icons seemed to be out of alignment, but that is because there is a margin at the bottom.
The "bottom edge of the image" is aligned with the baseline and appears to be misaligned.

Create a version with the margins removed.

I no longer feel misaligned.
