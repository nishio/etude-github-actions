Myopic perfectionism
From [/villagepump/perfectionism].
I think most people who think they are perfectionists are [myopic] [perfectionists][/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　what does that mean?
 　Perfection is not achieved by one person, but by "feedback from many.
 　Yet, you are delaying the release of your work by insisting on "short-sighted perfection" by "yourself alone," and you are forcing your work into a state where you cannot get "feedback from the masses.
 　They say they are "striving for perfection," but they are far from perfect.
