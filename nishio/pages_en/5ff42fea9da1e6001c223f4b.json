Only one of the divs lined up in ✅flexbox is scroll
When two divs are lined up on the left and right in flexbox, I want the left one to scroll because it is long vertically depending on the content in the text area, but I want the right one to ignore that scrolling because it is a menu -> Done!

I thought I could do it with maxHeight: 100%, overflowY: scroll on the left, but no luck.

　Why?
　Is it because the MaterialUI dialog is changing its behavior based on the size of the contents?
　	[React Dialog component - Material-UI https://material-ui.com/components/dialogs/]
　I changed to a fullscreen dialog that doesn't change size, but it doesn't seem to matter because it behaves the same.
　If maxHeight: 300px, I got the expected movement.
　But this 300px part varies depending on the environment, so I don't know what to do...

I set maxHeight: 75vh thinking that since I set it to →fullscreen dialog, I could make it viewport based.

Code. The width has changed from the time of the screenshot, which is not the main issue here.

code:ts
 <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
   <div
     style={{ flexGrow: 1, maxHeight: "75vh", overflowY: "scroll" }}
   >
     <TextareaAutosize ... />
   </div>
   <div
     style={{
       background: "#eee",
       padding: "2px",
     }}
   >
     Menu
   </div>
 </div>

I was given the idea of using [position: sticky] after making it
code:ts
 <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
   <div style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>...</div>
   <div>
     <div
       style={{
         position: "sticky",
         top: "0px",
         background: "#eee",
         padding: "2px",
       }}
     >
       Menu
     </div>
   </div>
 </div>
