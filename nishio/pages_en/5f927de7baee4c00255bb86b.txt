　Thoughts.
　　Let's go through it.
　　4hnw=N(nh+hw+wn)
　　 hmm
　　It's simply made so that if you do a full search, you won't get there in time.
　　Maybe we should do a full search and sample for small values.
　　At any rate, mod n shows that Nhw is a multiple of n and so on.
　Official Explanation
　　Searching for three values will not be done in time, but searching for two values will be done in time.
　　[All search with wide judgment].
　　　Is f(a,b,c) equal to d for integers a,b,c?" is a narrow decision
　　　Find c from a, b, d and ask, "Is c an integer?" is a broad decision
