Similar substitutes reduce satisfaction.
Compared eating a cheap chocolate with a high similarity to eating a granola bar with a low similarity when a high quality chocolate is not available instead. People believe that eating a high similarity is more satisfying, however, the high similarity causes an unfavorable negative contrast effect, and the low similarity alternative is more efficiently satisfying.

The similar level of satisfaction of those who continued to eat high-end chocolate and those who ate granola bars can be interpreted as a decrease in [satisfaction] when eating a similar [alternative].

>When people cannot get what they want, they often satisfy their desire by consuming a substitute. Substitutes can originate from within the taxonomic category of the desired stimulus (i.e., within-category substitutes) or from a different taxonomic category that serves the same basic goal (i.e., cross-category substitutes). Both a store-brand chocolate (within-category substitute) and a granola bar (cross-category substitute), for example, can serve as substitutes for gourmet chocolate. Here, we found that people believe that within-category substitutes, which are more similar to desired stimuli, will more effectively satisfy their cravings than will cross-category substitutes (Experiments 1, 2a, and 2b). However, because within-category substitutes are more similar than cross-category substitutes to desired stimuli, they are more likely to evoke an unanticipated negative contrast effect. As a result, unless substitutes are equivalent in quality to the desired stimulus, cross-category substitutes more effectively satisfy cravings for the desired stimulus (Experiments 3 and 4).
