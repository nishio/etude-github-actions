　Thoughts.
　　You can't increase the number at the top.
　　Overall, it can only be increased to i-1.
　　When a line is drawn from the goal value to the right, the value on the right will never cross that line. Because the only way to get to that value is to repeat the operation from further in front.
　　So classify by i-Ai, make sure it is monotonically non-decreasing, find the number of times from the start and end points, add them up, linear order
　Official Explanation
　　Instead of classifying it, they're doing it in a simpler way.
　　　+1 if +1 compared to the last time, +1 for the number of moves.
　　　 This corresponds to my "same classification"
　　　If there is more than that, it is NG.
　　　 This corresponds to "not monotonically non-decreasing
　　　Otherwise, hands + Ai
　　　 It takes more moves to increase from zero before that.
