 The Teal Organization--The Emergence of a Next-Generation Organization that Defies Management Conventionality
 Original title: Reinventing Organizations --- A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness
 	Reinventing the Organization --- A Guide to Creating an Organization Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness

 Drucker said [the knowledge society is not a society of bosses and subordinates], and this book examines 12 examples of such bossless organizations and finds a common pattern.
 It should be read with care to distinguish between [facts and interpretations]. Part 2 is a survey of 12 actual cases, and parts 1 and 3 are the author's interpretations based on them. They are not neatly divided, but mixed, so the reader must distinguish between them.

	According to the author's interpretation, there are two pre-organizational forms and five post-organizational forms
 	Classifying and naming is beneficial #patternlanguage
 The author interprets the change in the stage of human consciousness as bringing about a change in organizational structure, but I think the evolution of technology is bringing it about.

 Pre-organization → [Impulse-type organization] # Impulse-type
 	Technology capable of hunting large animals
  The more people, the better.
  Emergence of a leader to lead multiple people
  War with other tribes

 Impulse-type organization → [Adaptive organization] # Adaptive
 	Invention of agriculture: food [productivity increase] compared to hunting and gathering # Food productivity
  It is not enough to act [reactively] to events.
  We need to understand the calendar and take the right action at the right time.
  It is advantageous to have a plan, communicate that plan to the masses, and have the masses act according to that plan.
  Need to communicate information to a large number of people
  	Information and communication technology was not well developed at the time, so information had to be communicated by humans.
   The Birth of [Hierarchical Organization

	Adaptive organization -> [Master-formed organization].
 	Even in the agricultural era, there were improvements in tools, etc.
		Improved tools will bring [increased productivity].
  	I remember that the windmill mill in Venice was the first patented or something.
  The Industrial Revolution takes place.
  A "factory" is born.
		Early "factories" were hierarchically governed by adaptive organizations.
  Epochs are Ford's plant and Taylor's scientific management methods.
			[Scientific management method - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E7%9A%84%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E6%B3%95]
			Ideas for measuring and streamlining human work
   A quantitative KPI called "work efficiency" is introduced and people are managed.

	Achievement-oriented organization -> [Multidimensional organization].
 	This change is only happening in a small percentage of the population at this time.
  Advances in Information Processing Technology
  	End employees are now able to disseminate information.
   It is now possible to have a way of being other than "[superior]" in which a small number of top managers think and communicate their ideas.
  Of the tasks of the middle management level, the communication of information no longer needs to be done by a human being.
  	A form of "top management delivers a message directly to employees.
   If all the end employees deliver the message directly to the top management, the "summarizing job" will remain because the top management will not have enough information processing capacity and will fail.

	Adaptive, Achieving, and Diversified Organizations are not one in particular, but all are adaptive to the situation.

	[Evolutionary Organization]
 	Machines will surpass humans in the efficiency of "doing exactly what you are told to do" as automation technology improves.
   The pressure to "improve efficiency" in achievement-oriented organizations leads to the stripping of that work from human beings.
  Improved information transmission technology has eliminated the need for people to communicate with superiors.
  As a result, all employees will be engaged in the job of "thinking about what to do," which used to be done by top management.
