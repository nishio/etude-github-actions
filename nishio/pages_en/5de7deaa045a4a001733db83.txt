The ability to make decisions is cultivated through training to focus on one's feelings" ([Tomoya Tachikawa]).

explanation
	If you don't [verbalize] your [desire], you will not be able to communicate it to others and your desire will not be fulfilled.
		So you have to verbalize what you like and what you don't like, what you find interesting, what you want to do, in order to communicate!
			My [values].
			Like, dislike, [interesting], bored, want to, don't want to, are all "my feelings."
	If you don't verbalize it, you can't consciously think about it.

　I thought there was a lack of explanation about decisiveness.
　During the two years, I came to believe that "the focus on 'interesting' is especially important.

　What is decisiveness?
　　Ability to decide "I do" about choices that may or may not be made.
　　Assumption of "unclear whether it is better to do" because we are not bothered about options that are clearly better to do.
　　[Risk aversion tends to choose "don't" over expectations.
　　From a [trade-off between use and exploration] perspective, we need to choose "do" more than expected for exploration.
　　　So add the subjective plus term "interesting".

relevance
