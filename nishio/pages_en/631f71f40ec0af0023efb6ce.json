eccentrics and oddballs
from [https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m000293.html A hacker's last will and testament ─ Ikuo Takeuchi's idle moss No. 11: eccentrics and weirdos | Cybozu style].
[eccentric] and [weirdo].

[奇]
	>"Odd" has the nuance of being rare and superior, which "strange" does not have. This is the point. We say "[odd talent]," but not "strange talent. The first meaning of "[qiwei]" is to excel and be great," "qigui" is to excel and be clever," "qibone" is to have a rare spirit," "qishi" is to be an outstanding person," "qidou" is synonymous with prodigy," "[qiye]" is to be outstanding and exceptional," "qirei" is to excel and be beautiful," etc.
 > The second meaning of "eccentric" is someone with spare time. It gives a sense of spare time, which is nice.
 > I made a "[strange]" project, not "weird". I even wrote a "[bizarre]" colorful paper while planning the project.
	> "[Oddity]" of the idea.
	>The common denominator of all these unexplored and wonderful eccentrics is the strength of [curiosity]. In other words, they have a [heart that likes "strange"].
 > "[Oddly enough]" is another word I like to use.

The word "eccentric" now has a strong nuance of "eccentricity," but originally it had the nuance of "excellence.
	>To be deliberately unusual in order to attract attention. [Digital Daijisen https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E5%A5%87%E3%82%92%E8%A1%92%E3%81%86/]

I guess "kitchy" is also an outstandingly bizarre "thought," so it's a "bizarre idea" in the best sense of the word.

　Ah, I see, the nuance of "fell from the heavens".

Curiosity, assuming that "oddity" is a thing of excellence or descent from the heavens, would not include the "Mr. A and his daughter have returned from their marriage, I wonder what happened to them" that is so common in the countryside.

By the way, my sense now is that a culture is emerging in which "weirdo" has a positive meaning of "changeable person".
