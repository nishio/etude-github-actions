Faster Drawing
	I was thinking of doing it with [move stickies].
		But as far as moving stickies, it was surprisingly stress-free.
		So lower the priority until it's time to speed up pen drawing.
		â†’Needed with the implementation of the lasso choice.
	Need clarification: do I just stack layers on the same canvas or do I need to stack two canvases as DOM?
		Two canvases needed to be stacked. done

	[Faster pen input] done

	[Faster moving of stickies]
	[Faster path movement]
	[Faster drawing for updating text when creating stickies.]
