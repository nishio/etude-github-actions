Pen input on stickies
	[Arrow writing function]
		This is the illustration phase
	It is rather important to be able to enter pen input on a sticky note.
		The ability to hang directly on the canvas is not important.
	Really?
		Preparing a sticky note and then writing on it" is one extra step.
		Draw what comes to mind when you think of it.
		We can surround them later and group them together.

	Only GroupStateItem can be a parent now, but I wonder if there should be a hasChildren type in the future, since PieceStateItem can have PathStateItem in the future when we can handwrite on stickies.
