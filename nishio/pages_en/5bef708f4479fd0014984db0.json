There are those who think physicality is important and those who don't. [nishio.icon] is the latter.
I don't argue with those who think physicality is important because I think that is a working hypothesis that is difficult to test.

It's possible that they're not interested and don't know enough about it to pinpoint it because they don't know it in depth.
