SECI Model and PDCA Cycle
[https://gyazo.com/319156117756887b7e1f1d993feae537]
The relationship between the [SECI model] and the [PDCA cycle] was mentioned in [20200423 Learning Knowledge Creation Theory (SECI model) in Organizations].
I knew that the claim [S-PDCA] was made that S ([collaboration]) is necessary before PDCA, but hearing it verbatim makes a lot of sense because it has a lot of ancillary information attached to it.
In short, a Plan is made by formalizing and combining unverbalized tacit knowledge, so if you don't collaborate and share tacit knowledge in advance, you end up with "[an] unconvincing plan".
