Separable because of convex polygon
Asked how he came up with "separable because it is a convex polygon" in [Learning the identity map
I noticed it right after I saw it, so I guess there is a clue in the "not knowing and struggling stage" a little before that.

	At first, I thought "a one-hot representation in 2^N dimensions can be represented in N dimensions if the number it represents is represented in binary notation".
	I was still thinking this way when I saw the results of an experiment where 100 dimensional inputs could be represented by 7 intermediate layers.
	However, even six intermediate layers could be represented.
		2^6 is 64, okay? Not enough, huh?
	I couldn't wrap my head around how it was accomplished.
		I was also trying to visualize and observe the weights of the neural net, not mentioned in the article.
	I figured I'd do it in two dimensions to observe.
	Observations show that they are arranged in a ring pattern.

	This is something that finally worked after many attempts with different initial values, so the placement of this point has a strong significance
	If it is a meaningful arrangement, what is its meaning?
	I thought, "Well, they're lined up like this so I can just cut one out on a flat surface."
	Putting it into words, "any convex polygon is separable from any other vertex at any one vertex."
