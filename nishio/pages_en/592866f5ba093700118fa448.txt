blind spot
	When people learn, they must first realize that they do not yet know.
		In learning with textbooks, you may see "learning" as the act of taking something outside of yourself that you need to learn and incorporating it into yourself, because the textbooks contain a lot of "things you don't know yet".
  In [learning without textbooks], you must first discover what you don't know.
  Referring to this, Nishio expresses that "in order to learn, we must first become aware of our blind spots.

	You don't see it, but you don't know you don't see it. That is the blind spot.

	Between the "obviously know" area and the "obviously don't know" area lies the "don't know what you don't know."
