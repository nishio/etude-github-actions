 Perl-users.jp - a hub site for Japanese Perl users http://perl-users.jp/ seems to be getting a lot of traction in various places since it was created. http://www.python-users.jp/ was created. http://www. I think it would be a good idea to link or redirect to . python.jp/Zope/. Also, there's http://as-users.jp/.
 
 That's not the point. http://www.ruby-users.jp/ ... I pity Ruby Tsukihi too much. →I'm sorry to say that when I wrote this entry, the list of threads on 2channel was already up, but it's been replaced by a new one under construction. I should add that I wrote "too pity" only in the sense of "I feel sorry for you that you can't participate in the festival", not in reference to the management of this domain or anything like that. I'll take a precautionary measure.
