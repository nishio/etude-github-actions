Time it takes to make
N times the time it takes to make it and N times the time it takes to consume it.
Equal if there are N people who consume.

I wrote this because I thought when I heard that it takes time to draw a comic book, but only a moment to read it, what if it's equal, they both consume humanity's time, you can't add the same amount of minus and minus and still get zero.
