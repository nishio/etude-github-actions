> That while it is true that there are risks in the use of AI, a ban on development is not feasible and should not inhibit the application of new technologies or competition, and that it would be more practical to develop regulations on transparency and auditing instead.
> 
> I agree with you.

>[koizuka https://twitter.com/koizuka/status/1641280745502281728] The story that AI development should be stopped because of risks reminds me of the story of Mr. Kaneko, the developer of AI, who was banned from development because of the Winny trial, and lamented about the vulnerabilities that were exploited during the trial. I am reminded of the story that Mr. Kaneko, a developer, lamented that he was not allowed to take countermeasures against the spread of damage caused by exploitation of vulnerabilities.
