The more important the project, the more messy it starts.
 [problem-solving phase].
  I was trying to figure out what was the spike that stuck in my mind when I heard Yucai's story, and I have just verbalized it a bit.
  Level 2: Self-consciousness that I have a lot of things that I haven't started to work on, even though I have an idea for a solution.

 [Lack of time] is an excuse
  [Procrastination is not a solution because time never springs up.
 Is it [lack of confidence]?
  When you start a project, there are too many parallel projects that you can't [control] [anxiety].
   The more important the project, the more negative the bias toward [foregoing].
   The more important the project, the less likely it is to be initiated.
  [Lack of confidence in [project management skills]
  This is the one I wrote about before [how to get a load undetermined task].
   There is a bias that "[urgent] things" with deadlines are [prioritized].
    Maybe "the more [important] a project is, the more [messy] it should start.
    	see [Urgent/Important Matrix].
    Or "don't limit your [resources]" or something like that.
    Tasks that are important but not urgent and have been postponed.
     That hasn't caused any problems, so failure to allocate resources shouldn't be a big problem.
     There is a possibility that the level of urgency could increase after the start of the program.

 For example, I have applied for two online secretarial services at the same time. The reason why I haven't started the third one yet is that the vendor has started e-mail consultations, and that has slowed down my momentum.
