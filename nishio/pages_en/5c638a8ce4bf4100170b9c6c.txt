I hate advent calendars.
Apparently I don't like [advent calendars], so I'll write about why.
	I want to publish what I write immediately. Why delay until a specific date?
	Since the cognitive resources of readers are finite, it makes no sense to do your own submissions at a time when submissions are concentrated.
	Writing to a deadline is harder than writing without a deadline.

There's one benefit, too.
	People who cannot write without setting a deadline gain the impetus to write by setting a deadline of publication date and committing to their surroundings.
	Not-so-good company blogs, where the number of articles is a KPI, are useful in getting more articles.
	It is useful as an excuse for dormant circles to keep up appearances by working together at least once a year.
	Motivate people who can't get readers on their own to misperceive that they can get readers by bundling together with several other people.
		The quality doesn't improve just because it's gathered, it just causes [social corner-cutting].
