up operation
I'm aware that it's not a good name, but I haven't come up with a good one.
`up(pos): pos // (pos & -pos)`
code:python
 >>> debugprint([pos // (pos & -pos) if pos else 0 for pos in table])
 |                       1                       |
 |           1           |           3           |
 |     1     |     5     |     3     |     7     |
 |  1  |  9  |  5  |  11 |  3  |  13 |  7  |  15 |
 |1 |17|9 |19|5 |21|11|23|3 |25|13|27|7 |29|15|31|

code:python
 >>> debugprint(table)
 |                       1                       |
 |           2           |           3           |
 |     4     |     5     |     6     |     7     |
 |  8  |  9  |  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |  14 |  15 |
