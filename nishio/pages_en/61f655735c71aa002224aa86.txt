All things to all men - The prudent Proteus learns with the learned and is sanctified with the saints. It is a great art to win the favor of all, and their favor obtains general assent. They perceive the moods of men, and adapt themselves to each, mildly or seriously, as the case may be. Following their lead, they can cheat change as cunningly as possible. This is an essential art for dependent people. But this know-how must be very clever. Only those who have universal talent in their knowledge and universal ingenuity in their wit will find no difficulty.
