Cross-checking of two frequency tables
relevance
　Similar in mood to [half whole enumeration], but not necessarily a binary search.
　　When there is an equal sign condition instead of an inequality sign, etc.
　　If we make the whole enumeration a [frequency table] instead of a set of values, the corresponding values can be found in constant order
