　Thoughts.
　　[consider in order from the smallest to the largest].
　　1 when 1
　　110 at 2
　　 Since it is 4-2
　　111 at 3
　　 Since 2 + 1
　　100 at 4
　　101 at 5
　　When I was 6...
　　 11010
　　 4+2 is 8-2 and 8 is 16-8.
　　Separate odd and even digits
　　　[Evenly divided and tabulated]
	　　[$ N = S_0 \times (-2)^0 + S_1 \times (-2)^1 + ... + S_k \times (-2)^k]
	　　[$ = \sum_{i \in (0,2,4,...)} S_i 2^i - \sum_{i \in (1, 3,...)} S_i 2^i]
	　　[$ = S_0 + \sum_{i \in (2,4,...)} S_i 2^i - \sum_{i \in (1, 3,...)} S_i 2^i]

　　　mod 4, where the first term is S0, the second term is 0, and the third term is 2S2
　　　Therefore, the remainder divided by 4 determines the last two digits.
　　　Divide the remainder by four, and the same thing can be repeated.
　　　Repeat until it reaches 0.
　　　logarithmic order
	Official Explanation
	　Decide from the bottom in the same way.
