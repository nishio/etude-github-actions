Representation of chapters on Scrapbox
What we think is best at the moment:.
	"(Section number)" at the beginning of the title
	Columns are prefixed with "(Column)", not in a chapter tree.
	[/intellitech-en] in sort by title.
		Pages in chapters are displayed in order, then columns, then other keywords.
		Same order when converting to e-books

	What we have learned in the course of the [Engineer's Intellectual Production Englishization Project (-20200122)].
	The original book did not have section numbers, but rather a way of referring to "~ on page X" or "in chapter X".
	In digitizing this, page numbers become meaningless.
	So I decided to number the sections.
	`1: Chapter 1`, `1.2: Chapter 1, Section 2`, `1.2.3: Chapter 1, Section 2, Section 3`.
		The existence of `1.2:` and `1.2 ` distortions was weird.
			for some reason
			At first I thought just "X.X.X" would be fine, but then I got confused that if there is less than one period, it is a ground sentence, not a number.
			In some cases, the number is at the beginning of the title. "47% of ~"
	I found out when I made it, this is a problem when searching by section number.
		When I try to access 2.3 and search for 2.3.4 and 1.2.3, I get hits on 2.3.4 and 1.2.3 as well.
		If I add a semicolon at the end of the number, I can make it not hit 2.3.4, but still hit 1.2.3.
		It's especially bad because the higher the structure, the more titles that contain that number as part of it.
		So there needs to be a symbol before and after
			If this symbol is chosen appropriately, the sort order will be broken.
				code::
				 ["1:", "1.1:", "1.1.1:"].sort()
     ["1.1.1:", "1.1:", "1:"]
     
     ["1)", "1.1)", "1.1.1)"].sort()
     ["1)", "1.1)", "1.1.1)"]
			The colon is after the number in ASCII code.
	I've added branch numbers as "X-Y" or "X_Y", but Scrapbox equates underscores with spaces, so the latter is blank.
