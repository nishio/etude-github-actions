Maybe the group doesn't need a nameplate.
	2019-12-10 Just noticed.
	I was thinking about handling mouse events around stickies.
	Suppose this were implemented.
		Opening and closing grouped stickies is one-tap, but it's not that frequent, so a balloon menu would be fine.
 		[sticky click to open/close, not balloon menu].
 No need for "open and close by clicking on the nameplate."
 	We just need a balloon to appear when you click on a group.
		Now "nameplate" is explicitly specified as a nameplate attribute of the Group object
			That's why we need "Generate stickies when creating groups".
			The problem of [when you want to create a group, the nameplate for that group already exists] occurs.
			Sometimes you want to change the nameplate later.
		There is something wrong with this design.
		Another design proposal
			The group has several children."
			The summary display when the group is closed is determined by its contents."
			If there is a sticky in the top right corner, it is displayed as a nameplate sticky."
			I think this is fine.
			If the top right-most object is a path, just display a thumbnail of the entire path.
		This design would
			There is already a sticky equivalent to a nameplate -> bring it to the upper right corner and group it
			To change the nameplate â†’ Place the new nameplate sticky in the upper right corner.
		Must be able to change relative position by drag-drop within a group
