 *1249362011* Too bad.
 I was so happy to get rid of the Sunday meeting that I skipped Tuesday's meeting, and now I realize that I had another meeting on Monday.

 The housework switches on intermittently, which is why I have tea with white stuff growing in the kettle. I'm going to pretend I didn't see it and make kimchi nabe today!
 
 First I'll scrape off the grayish parts of the Chinese cabbage! There are roots growing on the Chinese cabbage! If I plant it, will it grow?
 
 One carrot was out of the bag and shriveled beyond help. Discarded. The one that was in the bag is fine. I think I'll wrap the one out of the bag next time.
 
 By the way, what do these handwritten numbers mean... no matter what you think, it's the date and time you bought it...

 I have a lower boundary line between sanitary and unsanitary than most people, so I am not sure if I would be okay with people eating things that I am okay with eating. When you eat expired kimchi and yogurt on a daily basis, you don't care about expiration dates.
 
 Done, done, done. Materials:.
 - About two months ago.
 -- 1 carrot
 -- A little Chinese cabbage
 -- Tofu
 -- Kimchi
 - Bought it today.
 -- eringi
 -- Bunashimeji mushroom
