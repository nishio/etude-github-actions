 Literal-to-literal calculations are calculated at byte-compile time and the results are written to the byte code.
 
 Unfortunately, we do not calculate expressions that contain variables even if it is obvious that they are constants.
 >|python|
 >>> def foo():
 ... 	N = 10
 ... 	return 2 ** N
 ... 
 >>> dis.dis(foo)
   2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (10) 
               3 STORE_FAST               0 (N)

               9 LOAD_FAST                0 (N)

 <hr>
 2 ** 10 was also optimized in 2.5, so the example was changed.
 >|python|
 # 2.6
 >>> def foo(): return 1.0 / 2.0
 ... 
 >>> dis.dis(foo)
   1           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (1.0)
               3 LOAD_CONST               2 (2.0)
               6 BINARY_DIVIDE       
               7 RETURN_VALUE        
 
 # 3.0
 >>> def foo(): return 1.0 / 2.0
 ... 
 >>> dis.dis(foo)
   1           0 LOAD_CONST               3 (0.5) 
               3 RETURN_VALUE

 <body>I get CONST even in 2.5.1, is this a backported thing? </body>

 <body>Oh, it seems that 2 ** 10 is a constant even at 2.5, while 1 / 2 is not. I made the mistake of using a power as an example because I thought it would be easier to understand. </body>

 <body>That's interesting, but looking at the travails, it's a mistake to call it a 3.0 optimization</body>.
