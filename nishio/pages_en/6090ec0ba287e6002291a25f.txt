 I was having problems with apt-get commands giving me errors like "E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing? archive.ubuntu.com:http' (-5 - No address associated with hostname)" and so on. I was having a problem with "http' (-5 - No address associated with hostname)" or something like that, but I couldn't find any information on this error message when I searched for it. I noticed that when I started up my browser, I couldn't connect. Ping failed by domain name; ping succeeded by IP address specification. So it's a DNS problem.
 
 That's what I thought, so I looked again and found the information. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/atasatamatara/20120410/1334052582
 In /etc/resolv.conf, change nameserver 127.0.0.1 to nameserver 8.8.8.8.
 
 The connection is now established. We are happy, happy, happy.
