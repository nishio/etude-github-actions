	>I used to think that in an interview, when someone says X, I need to ask if I can replace it with "Y, which I consider interchangeable with X," in order to make sure I understand the meaning of X correctly. I was thinking that I needed to ask if I could replace X with "Y which I consider interchangeable with X" in order to make sure that I understood the meaning of X correctly.

 Interviewing is a process of unraveling the unspoken structures of the other person's mind.
 The meaning of words is subjective.
 Whether the meaning of the words used by the other party is objectively correct or not is meaningless.
 So the idea that "X and Y are close in meaning to me" is out of focus.
 You have to ask what is the closest thing to X in the other person.
