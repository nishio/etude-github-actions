 *1314270671* Words ending in "e".
 In WordBasket, the basic idea is to play the basic game of shiritori, but since we have to think of words that start with "◯" and end with "◯", I feel like I have to use a part of my brain that I don't usually use. So, in my free time, I tried to think of words that end with "e". Note that the rule of Shiritori is the Word Basket rule, so the word must be more than 3 letters: <a href='http://jaga-tokyo.com/wordbasket/'>What is Word Basket ｜ Word Basket official website</a>.
