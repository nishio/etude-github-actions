Businessization of Methodology
Suppose there is a method Y to achieve some objective X.
　Suppose there is a Mr. Z who teaches method Y.
　For some reason, the phenomenon "Mr. Z has never achieved objective X" may occur.

Mr. Z's objective is not "to achieve objective X" but "to teach method Y".
　Mr. Z is [a man whose goal is to teach].
　　Mr. Z has never achieved objective X, and neither has the person who taught him to achieve it, but Mr. Z's objective has been achieved.
　In many cases, they are compensated for teaching.
　Sometimes they do not receive monetary compensation, in which case they gain the self-esteem of being in a position to teach.

[Similar to, but different from, "means to an end.
The means to an end is,
 There is a method Y to achieve some objective X,
 There is a Mr. [_ do] Z who [_ do] method Y,
 For some reason, "Mr. Z is not interested in achieving [_] objective X."
This phenomenon is caused by Mr. Z finding value in "doing method Y itself" or gaining self-esteem as "me doing method Y".
In the case of the "business of methods," Mr. Z does not [_do_] method Y himself, but only [_teaches_] it.
