dilemma of scale and quality
　Projects with selection (A)
　　[Gated Communities]
　　Suppose this produces some value.
　Thinking you want more value
　　Trying to increase scale in the short term will reduce the quality of selection (B)
　　If the quality of the selection is the factor that produces value, value will not be produced.
　　[It's an allegory for "the goose that lays the golden egg.
　　　Killing a goose that lays one golden egg a day in an attempt to get more money out of it.
　We should create a community with no or weak selection before the gate.
　　First, improve quality within this community.
　　Ex post facto, the scale can be expanded without compromising the quality of the selection.
