	Thoughts.
	ã€€Huh? Isn't it possible to do [approximate enumeration] on the square root order, so it's not too late to find and add them in a naive way?
		code:python
		 def solve(N):
       s = sum(get_divisors(N))
       if s == 2 * N:
           return "Perfect"
       if s < 2 * N:
           return "Deficient"
       return "Abundant"
