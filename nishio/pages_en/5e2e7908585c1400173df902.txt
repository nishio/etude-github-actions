React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies
code:ts
   const [state, setState] = useGlobal("state");
   const { key } = useParams();
   useEffect(() => {
     if (state === "NORMAL") {
       if (key === "new") {
         foobar().then((id) => {
           setState("CREATED_NEW")
         });
         setState("WAIT_NEW")
       }
     }  // (snip)
   }, [key]) 
I wrote this with the intention of updating the state by triggering a change in key, but it warns me that there are missing dependencies for the state.
What's wrong and what should we do about it?
