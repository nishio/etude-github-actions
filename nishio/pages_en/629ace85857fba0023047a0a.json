	[/villagepump/ Masui and nishio have symmetrical ideas in terms of "same" and "difference"].

 　It was pointed out to me that there is a difference between focusing on the differences and focusing on the same, but I thought as I was writing this article that sometimes we are focusing on the same.

  	I'm starting to get the feeling that this is not a symmetrical relationship.
  	　Mr. Masui's "X and Y are the same" is an "invention of a new point of view" that "from this point of view, they appear to overlap.
  	　　Figure: [The image appears to overlap depending on the viewing direction].
  	　When I say "different" I don't think it's "X and Y don't overlap when you change your point of view".
  	　　The X is vague and spread out (= low resolution), should be observed more clearly (= increase resolution).
  	　　Are you changing the camera lens rather than changing the point of view? Are you adjusting the focus?

[/sta/generalizing-masui-san and specializing-nishio-san].
I thought for a while and came up with the expression [Mr. Masui leaving and Mr. Nishio approaching][/sta/sta.icon].
 Mr. Masui is looking for a bird's eye view, or rather, a point of view, from a distance.
 Mr. Nishio moves closer to increase resolution.
