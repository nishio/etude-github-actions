[Listen-out chat system] [End design] nishio20190729_0218

What we noticed in this case
	Assumption: "How do we estimate the user's emotional state to change the flow of the conversation?"
	â†’ "If the assumption is that the user agrees to the purpose and uses the command in advance, why not just educate the user on the emotional expression command?"
	I found myself taking a step back in perspective.

1> Let's talk.
0> What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
1> I would like to think about how best to design the end of the conversation
0> Is there anything else you can tell us about that design?
1> Now that there is no design for the end, the dialogue continues to linger, which is not good!
0> What kind of endings are those?
1> When the user says, "I see! and when something strikes me, I want to end up fleshing it out, and when I'm in a mode where it's not working, I want to remind them of their purpose and get them back on the road.
0> Is there anything else about that user?
1> If I can observe the user's emotions, I'd like to change the way I talk to them, whether it's "I'm excited to discover something new" or "I'm getting annoyed that my questions don't stick well".
0> What type of user is this user?
1> The type of user who feels the value of verbalizing what cannot be verbalized.
0> How do you know the user?
1> I feel like I should specify in advance that that's the purpose.
0> Is there anything else you can tell us about its purpose?
1> If we clearly state "This is a system to elicit "I see"" in advance, and say "If you think "I see", please type "I see"", is there no need to presume it?
0> anything else about that advance?
1> I see this as stationery for intellectual production, and stationery increases the value you produce by learning how to use it beforehand.
0> How do you know its advance?
1> There's no way to know if the user has learned beforehand, and it's the user's responsibility not to learn, so you don't need to know.
0> Where is that advance located?
1> NGKW
0> Where is that user located?
1> Not restricted in location, can be used from a smartphone while traveling on a train.
0> Is there anything else about that phone?
1> This is another newly available stationery for intellectual production that mankind can use to increase productivity.
0> Is there anything else you can tell us about that stationery?
1> For example, [a pen, a primitive stationery tool, can hold more information than the memory in a living human brain by writing down thoughts].
0> What do you value?
1> Stationery improves human intellectual productivity.
0> What is the relationship between that stationery and the user?
1> Stationery enhances users' intellectual productivity
0> Is that user the same as stationery? Is it different?
1> No, sir.
0> What happens to the stationery when the user
1> NG
0> What happens to the user when the stationery
1> NG
0> What is between the user and the stationery?
1> There is a learning cost. The value of stationery is demonstrated not only by the stationery as a thing, but also by paying the cost of learning it
0> How do you know its stationery?
1> NG
0> Where is that stationery located?
1> Bye-bye.
1> (In this case, the value creation was in the fact that I realized that I could take a step back and think, "If the user agrees with the purpose in advance, why don't I just educate the user on the emotional expression commands there?)
