Chance to receive 1 million yen
Suppose you had a chance to potentially get a million dollars.

	A: People who find an opportunity, apply, and get a million dollars.
	B: Those who found an opportunity, applied for it, and did not receive one million yen.
	C: Those who found an opportunity and did not apply for some reason.
 D: Those who did not find the opportunity

The question of what would happen if these four different people were arranged in order of goodness would bring out many different values.
By the way, I am `A > B > D >>> C`, with C being by far the worst, and the other three being dumplings, but if I had to rank them, I would say A, B, and D, in that order.
