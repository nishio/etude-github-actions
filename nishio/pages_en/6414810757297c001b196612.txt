What should I do to survive?" is agrarian thinking.
>[@nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1636071412774612992] I wondered what in the world [what I should do for a living] after a few years of LLM going through this, but then I saw this tweet and realized. The [implicit assumption] that "[what to do]" is uniquely determined, just like [agrarian] people who [settle] think "[where to live]." So that implicit assumption does not hold for [nomads].
	>[@ochyai https://twitter.com/ochyai/status/1636021023652081664] ... If we think of [Digital Nature] as a new commons, we can find a way to live as nomads settled in a rich natural environment. This commons includes non-massive nature, and is a new natural environment that can be shared, not reduced by division. This world can be seen as a kind of settled nomadic age, like the Jomon period....

[agrarian bias].
