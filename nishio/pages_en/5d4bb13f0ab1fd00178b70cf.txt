	[Human History of Violence and Inequality
	Japan used to be a society with high [inequality], but the inequality has decreased. The story goes that this is because we fought an all-out war that mobilized the entire population and the entire economy, and we lost (but not only that).
	If you give this book to someone who thinks [equality] is good and [inequality] is bad, or [peace] is good and [war] is bad, they are going to have cognitive dissonance and go crazy.
