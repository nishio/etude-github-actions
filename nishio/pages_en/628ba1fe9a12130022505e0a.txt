　2022-05-25 If I don't have a picture in my diary, I'll put up a picture of a cat or a flower or something.

✅ Unexplored Association Meeting
 ✅ Complete additions to the study page.
 Read the email of [KJ Method Study Group @ Loftwork].
  I replied ✅ lightly.
  　It sounds interesting if you read it carefully, but I don't have time, so I'd rather do smaller tasks and keep the flow going than try to block it by trying to do bigger tasks.
 ✅[About the Progress of Unexplored Junior and the Unexplored Ecosystem].
 　Watch the video and turn important words into text.

[Shadow of a word]
　Associated:[always in the shadows].
　　It doesn't directly match the context in which the shadows were mentioned.
　　　But we can find it.
　　The story that even if you think you are dealing with something highly abstract, it should always be accompanied by a "concrete experience" of the least abstract level.
　　　I imagine this "concrete experience" as a "shadow on the ground".

[Oblique Strategies]
 I just happened to see it.
 One that considers advice to be randomly selected as in [Tarot] or [I Ching].
 　This could be interpreted in the context of Gendlin.

hangover
　The micra server has solved the disk full, but we haven't confirmed that it's working, and there are updates to the server itself, so we'll put it together and do it at night.

　Proposal to read Kozaneba user scripts and such from Scrapbox.
　Moving Scrapbox cards to KJ legal, since it's a regular topic of discussion, I'll make a page explaining how to do it in Kozaneba.
　The subtraction service itself doesn't ring a bell, but development on Scrapbox sounds interesting.
　　I was thinking about what we might develop [a motivation system].
