Difference between risk and uncertainty
Difference between [risk] and [uncertainty] by Knight
There is a black-and-white ball in a jar, and the white one is a success.
	Known distribution: risk: analysis required, classical statistics
	Unknown distribution: Uncertainty: estimation procedures required, e.g. Bayesian estimation
	The principle itself is unknown: Knight's uncertainty: the methodology for this is [effectuation].
	p.31-35

On the counterpart of analysis and estimation
	If the distribution is known in a mathematical sense, the expected value is also known, without the need for statistical analysis.
