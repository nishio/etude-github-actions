Royalty has no contact with the common people.

> @raurublock There are some ideas about a post-COVID-19 society, like "not having much contact with people will be the norm", but as a counterpoint, it's possible that people will get used to the fact that about 2% of the population dies every year and stop caring, and that society will incorporate that. It's not inconceivable.
	[nishio.icon]Instead of either of those opposites, it could stabilize in the form of Musca's "royalty appears before the common people in a hologram, and attacks from the common people do not pass" in Laputa, where the royalty and nobility have no contact with people and about 2% of the common people who are forced to do that "contact work" die.

Historically speaking, the period of that structure would have been longer.
