I want to update the Kth value of the heap.
from [heapq]
I want to update the Kth value of the heap.
-> rewrite, then _siftdown can be used to return to heap state with O(logN)
　However, this K is not the Kth in the sort order, so it is not useful. If you want to update an arbitrary value, it takes O(N) to find where that value is in the list.
　	see [heapq+dict]
　For example, if you want to "update the second largest value," you can use K=1,2, which is determined by comparing the two locations. I think so.
code:python
 from heapq import _siftdown
 
 queue = [1, 2, 3]
 K = 1
 queue[K] = -1
 _siftdown(queue, 0, K)
 print(queue)  # => [-1, 1, 3]
