　Purchase Intention Survey
　Prototype according to the actual buying process
　　Prepare a mock-up storefront or website
　Reduce the cost of creation by dividing the prototype into three parts
　　[three prototypes of function, appearance, and context].

Case 1 (B2C)
 Renting out an electronics store
 Putting appearance prototypes on the shelf
 Place catalogs and pop-ups (contextual prototypes)
 No need to prototype features because consumer electronics retailers usually buy without trying features
 Fake magazines and TV commercials available.
 　We can look for differences between the groups that saw it and those that didn't.
Case 2 (B2B)
 If a product requires a higher-level decision, design it with that process in mind.
 Research to identify medical equipment needs
 Exterior prototypes installed.
 Prototypes to confirm functionality are also available.
 Prepare spec sheets and instructions as contextual prototypes
 　However, the majority of the instructions are for the previous product, with only the new features inserted post-its.
　　Handed out pre-order sheets, special offers available if you book here.
