Should Scrapbox have a comment feature?
In considering [the comment function].
　A: An unspecified number of people can comment.
　B: Only certain people can comment
is something else

Regarding the latter, there's a growing momentum to "just make it a co-edit."

The resistance to co-editing may be a metaphor for the blog that has seeped in over the years.

Something I wrote a long time ago.
　[Proposal to add comment function to Scrapbox].
　　When I wrote this I knew we needed a comment feature.
　Would [trackback] be enough?
　　does not look good
　As for the former, I figured I could just ego search Twitter with the Scrapbox URL.
