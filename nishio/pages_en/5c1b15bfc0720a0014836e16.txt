Hand drawn diagram
In [CUMOT2018], [Shinta Nakayama] pointed out that "hand-drawn diagrams may look [lazy].

First of all, according to the principle of "[not aiming for perfection from the beginning]," I write by hand at the point of outputting what comes to my mind.
	At this point, thoughts such as, "If this goes into the slide as is, won't it look corny?" and so on are not occurring at all.
	Anyway, the top priority is to output and not disappear.
	Rarely start making slides directly in PowerPoint because if this is difficult to do, it will hinder the output.

Once you have an overall picture of what you will be speaking by writing it down, the next step is to improve the quality in the limited time before the talk.
	Transcribing handwritten text into slides and
	Time will be allocated in balance with the overall picture, so that the handwritten work will be cleaned up later.
		Handwritten cleanup is time consuming.
		Improvement in quality per hour is greater for text cleanup.
		[Done is better than perfect]

If the handwriting is not cleared in time
	That handwriting will never be removed because "the purpose of a lecture is to communicate what you want to say."

I think the thought process is that it's a handwritten slide.

When was the first time you did a handwritten slide?
I was able to quickly find this one from 2010

	The slides themselves do not have hand-drawn diagrams, but rather handwritten explanations on the whiteboard of what I felt was not being conveyed well orally during the lecture process, which I photographed on the spot and added to the slides for publication after the fact.
	This is probably the first or very first time I put a hand-drawn diagram on a slide.
