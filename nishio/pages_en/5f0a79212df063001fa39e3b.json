formal power series
　Polynomial extended to have an infinite number of terms
　　Corresponding to an infinite number sequence
　　	[$ F = \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_i x^i]
　　At this point, the formal power series [$ F] is the [mother function] of the sequence [$ \{f_i\}
　　The operation of taking the coefficients of the nth order terms from a formal power series F is written as [$ [x^n]F ].
　There is a convenient property inherited from the polynomial
　　Additions and subtractions
　　multiplication
　　	[$ [x^n](F\times G) = \sum_{i+j=n} ([x^i]F \times [x^j] G) ]

	[Use of Factorization]
	　We can use [binomial theorem] for each of them by allowing F to factorize
		[$ F^T = (A + B)^T (C + D)^T = (\sum_i \binom{T}{i}A^iB^{T-i} ) \times (\sum_j \binom{T}{j} C^jD^{T-j}) ]
		[exchange products and sums].
		[$ F^T = (\sum_{i,j} \binom{T}{i}\binom{T}{j}A^iB^{T-i}C^jD^{T-j}) ]
