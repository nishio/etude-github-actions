The dilemma of acquiring knowledge from outside the company
[https://gyazo.com/a9ce6073f1a3299b01b24b2f53f3cf97]
	It is cheaper for someone to acquire and distribute the knowledge than to acquire and distribute it individually [knowledge acquisition], because the overall cost is lower [overall optimum].
 However, it is not the best strategy for individuals because costs are concentrated on "the person who makes that acquisition"
 If an individual chooses "not to acquire knowledge from outside the company himself/herself" as the optimal strategy, the organization loses a lot by no one acquiring knowledge from outside the company.
