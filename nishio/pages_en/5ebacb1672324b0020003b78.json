State after reading the book
[https://gyazo.com/0635c75cf0893e03060bcfc850c18776]
 Forget about the book
 	Nothing changes in behavior before or after reading the book.
 	I remember the contents of a book right after I read it, but I forget it over time.
 　This is zero, same as not reading it.
 　"Behavioral change" and "forgetting" are related.
 　　Memories are fixed by repeated use.
 There is one word or concept that I like from the book.
  This is one.
  If behavior doesn't change, it will eventually be forgotten and reduced to zero.
 2, there are two ways.
 　2a Two concepts in the book are connected
 　2b Connecting concepts in the book to your own experiences and concepts already in your mind
 　Between the two, b is preferable.
			Why?
			2a, because we haven't yet reached step 3 in the figure below.

　　In 2a, it's still likely to collectively forget and zero out.
　　In 2b, being connected to one's own experience makes it harder to forget.

I think I wrote something similar before...
　[Reading results].
　[De-"extracted" theory].
　　[how knowledge is connected when reading a book].
　[Hopefully the knowledge in the book will connect with my experience].
