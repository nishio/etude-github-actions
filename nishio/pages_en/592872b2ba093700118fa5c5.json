Writing is not about sitting at a desk and writing.
Original title: If you think "[writing]" means "sitting at a desk and writing," there's nothing you can do in your [skimpy] time.
	It was a little too long, so I cut it down.
	Example of taking writing as a big [ambiguous task

	Divided into "output fragments" and "summarize output fragments" phases.
 	Task [Breakdown].
 Outputting fragments can be performed in a skimmer.
 	For example, one can write a sticky note while riding the escalator on a train transfer.
  	The original inspiration for this text was actually written out that way.
