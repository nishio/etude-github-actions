People who say things they don't understand.
I was watching a friend's Twitter exchange and thought.
First, as an observational fact: "There are people in the world who say things they don't understand."
When someone says something to you like that, you tend to try to understand what they are saying
Since they do not understand well, they try to understand the intent of the utterance, or in some cases, they go out of their way to try to read a "rebuttal" from a statement they do not understand, thinking that "the tone is rebuttal-like, so it must be an objection to our opinion".

I don't think you need to put in the effort to do that and just say, "I'm not sure.

Life is short, so you don't need to know everything you see. You only need to know what you value to know.
