Read three books in the same field and you'll become an expert.
 There's a well-known idea that goes something like, "If you read three books in the same field, you'll become [an expert]," but I'm wondering what it comes from and if there are any sources that I can cite or mention.
  [kur] Triangulation? It's a social science field, but I suspect [http://www.cscd.osaka-u.ac.jp/user/rosaldo/16_triangulation_Social_SCience.html] is the original source [kur].
   >Triangulation in the social sciences was proposed by Norman K. Denzin in his 1978 book, and was conceived as a way to enhance the validity of [qualitative research] by pluralizing methodologies and methods of verification (called "triangulation" because it assumes more than three dimensions that are neither unitary nor dualistic) (Denzin 1970, 1978, 1989). It was conceived as a way to increase the validity of [qualitative research] by pluralizing methodologies and validation methods (Denzin 1970, 1978, 1989).
   > Denzin proposes at least four basic visualizations of triangulation: 1) triangulation of the data itself, 2) triangulation of the researcher, 3) triangulation of the theories used in the analysis, and 4) methodological triangulation. These are: 1) triangulation of the data itself, 2) triangulation of the researcher, 3) triangulation of the theory used in the analysis, and 4) triangulation of the methodology.
   Reading three different books is an action similar to (1), which diversifies the input information sources with respect to the act of "reading and studying".
