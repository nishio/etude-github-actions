stabation
Mr. Hoshino talked about concurrency control yesterday.
When a long task collides with a short task, the longer task loses probabilistically, so
Only short tasks are done and long tasks are not executed for a long time.
The stuation that "I'm not going to be able to do it," happens,
That is to say,
In human task management, when I had small tasks and large tasks, I did only small tasks.
I thought it looked a lot like the problem of large tasks being left untouched.

The latter is not bumped and reverted.
The distortion of task selection timing to avoid large tasks rather than uniform randomness is the cause of the distortion.
So, I thought that if I could reverse the bias, I could solve the stavation problem.
