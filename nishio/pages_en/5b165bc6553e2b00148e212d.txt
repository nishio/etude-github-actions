scbot
It's trendy to put bots in chats and such, but I'd like to put a bot in Scrapbox.
	I want to watch scbot live on Scrapbox
		I want to feed them (information) and watch their reactions.
  [Chatbots] have a synchronous image.
  	Reactively responds to user input
   I want to watch various activities asynchronously on their own.
 I want to connect to my Scrapbox when I'm ready for useful activities.
 	Not just a scullery maid.
  I would like to join up with the bot when it is able to produce useful intellectual production [spontaneously] within the bot's personal project.
  	What is a useful [intellectual production] activity?
				Use your head, something new, output.

---Past Logs
　I thought the only way to write was to use [Puppeteer] to type line by line (2018).
　The method of having JSON imported [blu3mo] was realized (2021).
　I didn't need Puppeteer [Use Deno and Remove Puppetter by takker99 - Pull Request #6 - tkgshn/scrapbox-Duplicator https://github.com/tkgshn/scrapbox- Duplicator/pull/6/commits/09e4d201631bd7e8192b111bb3b5ad27577eb4d6]

	difficult (e.g. customer, guest, child)
 	There is no API, and there is no hope that an API will be provided because it does not fit the developer's philosophy to provide an API.
 We have to do it with browser operation automation.
 Do you want to operate Headless Chrome with [Puppeteer]?

 	There are people doing [Headless Chrome] on [Heroku].
	Maybe, but I think it's a pain in the ass when multiple lines are updated at once in a short period of time and that causes conflicts.
  Why Scrapbox management does not want to implement a write API
 Even when the program writes, it seems like a good idea to write each line with [- mindful] weighting.


Communicate in a non-written way
	When I used to make a UserScript page output, I had to delete the auto-generated page afterwards.
		[Auto delete auto-generated pages].
	One idea is that [Scrapbox is a place for stock, not flow], so you shouldn't post such things, and they should flow to Slack, etc.
 	Another idea is to use Scrapbox, including writing such things, and then implement deletion.
