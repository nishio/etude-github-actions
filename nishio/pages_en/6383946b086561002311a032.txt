People who are too busy to control their emotions.

I believe that people who are frustrated online are people who are "too busy" and "concerned about others". And when you are "too busy at work" & "too busy in your private life," the ultimate monster is complete. If you meet one, run away without fighting.


I thought this [too busy to control emotions] was related to [intellectual production and vipassana], so I wrote it down
ã€€[Emotional Control]

The one with too much time on his hands may have something to do with [leisurely harm].
