If you tell someone who doesn't know X to look for it because X is in Y, they can't find it.
　If you are given a cardboard box and told to "look for a buba in here," you can't look for it because you don't know what a buba is.
　I suppose the same could be said for "[the right answer is] inside of you to find it."
