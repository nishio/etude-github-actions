Shuji Hamaguchi's Collaboration Experiment
[Collaboration] experiment of [Shuji Hamaguchi
Comparative experiment between thinking alone and thinking with many people
	A: 1 hour discussion
	B: 20 minutes of silence and thinking alone, the remaining 40 minutes of discussion
	C: 20 minutes of silent thinking alone, then sharing, then another 20 minutes of silent thinking, then discussion in the last 20 minutes
	D: 40 minutes of silence and thinking alone, then discussion in the last 20 minutes

A is bad, B, C, and D are better than A, with C being the best

	Two sets of 202 building blocks (kuum) were given and the challenge was to "create an amazing piece of work" in 60 minutes.
	Definition of awesomeness and evaluation criteria are left to the team.
	This experiment is divided into three teams.
		A: Leave the members free to do as they please.
		B: 40 minutes of individual work, followed by sharing
		C: 20 minutes individual work, then share, then consider bias model, then break bias
	result
		Team A used up all of its time in discussion and did not complete its work.
		Team B had an individual who came up with an interesting idea during the 40 minutes and the idea was adopted during the sharing phase
			Started making parapara manga with building blocks.
		Team C didn't come up with any interesting ideas during the 20 minutes.
			However, after looking at the works that came out and discussing them, we discovered a bias that the works that came out "assume that they are stopped
			The idea was to break that bias, and the result was a work in motion.
		Teams B and C were tied.

	It is useful to think alone and make something concrete before discussing the cut-off
		It is important to pair concrete ideas with abstract cuts
		[The combination of the concrete and the abstract is important.]
 	Team A, which started the discussion from the beginning, ended up discussing abstract cuts.
	 >[The key to collaboration is not to argue.]
			Team C discussed bias for 20 minutes, but Hamaguchi thinks it would have been better if each of the seven had a parallel task here to consider bias
				Another workshop was conducted based on this idea, and it was actually good, he said
