Question on p.195 translation
Hmmm, I think I'm interpreting this differently.
>Since experienced meanings are multi-schematic, the schematic relations between them are created according to their new meanings (17). But if we start from a particular explained relation, an instance of such a relation must be created between two other equally specified and explained meanings, such as A and B.
>(en)Since experienced meanings are multischematic, the schematic relation between them is created along with the new meaning. But suppose we begin with a given specified relationship, an instance of which is to be created between two other also specified meanings, A and B.

Hmmm, let's read ahead.
Although it is missing from the translation, I think the first half is a case where the relation is created, while the latter is a given case. The next sentence is also about a given relationship.
The multi-scheme nature of experience allows us to find new aspects of this given relation as well.
This new aspect can be ~ed by both A and B
Hence, the "newly created application" of that given relation between A and B is also multi-schematic.
Even if all three elements, A, B, and relation, are specified as unique.
