 *1249453343* Meaning of percentages in email addresses
 Members in their late 20's or so, "I wonder if it is a mobile culture that ML participants in their late teens or so nowadays throw one-line emails (without names or signatures) to ML", "I saw others giving their names and wondered what this culture was, but I went along with it", "Speaking of 'what the heck', 'hoge@fugam%piyo desu'! I'm not sure if it's the same thing or not! I'm like, "What the hell is this? What's a %?" We had the conversation, "I don't know the definition." I brought up the subject of %, but I was the one who didn't know the definition, so I took the responsibility(?) I threw it on Twitter.
 
 The results are quite interesting and can be summarized as follows

 It is very natural for A c/o B to be A c/o B, since A c/o B becomes B c/o A, and A c/o B is temporarily in B. I think the most natural flow would be: sama kata (care of) → c/o → % → temporary place → state. The symbols are hard to look up because I can't Google them. If we are serious, should we lick the ML or NetNews archives to collect examples of % or c/o being used in the first line?
 
 I found a letter in Wikipedia that is written like a % of c/o
 >>
 c/o or &#8453;
 "care of", used to address a letter when the letter must pass through an intermediary

 Searching for percent hack and found the statement "% was chosen for percent hack because of its similarity in form to c/o" <a href='http://www.livinginternet.com/e/ew_addr.htm'>Email Addresses</a>.

 There are examples of email addresses using % in surprisingly familiar places!
 
 So, the person in his late 20s (me) who said, "Don't late teens know about the culture of name recognition?" didn't know about the time when it was necessary to specify the relay server in the e-mail address.

 From a buzzard comment

 id:hasegawayosuke foo%bar@zoo sounds like a relay server, but with foo@bar%zoo I thought you were writing the current status in a shell prompt.
 <<
 Oh yes. I'm interested in whether foo%bar@baz or foo@bar%baz was more common in the early days when percentages were first used for names. There seems to be a theory that the use of percentages to write status is both an email address and a shell prompt, so without deciding which is correct, I decided to use the title "The Meaning of Percentages in Email Addresses. However, since foo@bar%baz is incorrect if it is an e-mail address and foo%bar@baz is incorrect if it is a prompt, I thought it would be clear which one is the origin if we examine which was more common in the early days.
 Personally, since @ itself is a symbol used in e-mail addresses, I expect that "foo%bar@baz will be used to refer to a temporary location," "%bar will be interpreted as referring to a temporary location," "foo@baz%bar will be used," "this is a prompt," and "this is a misinterpretation of a prompt. I expect that this will be the case.

 I bought this 3-color LED matrix for 500 yen, thinking it would be a failure if it was a failure. I finally wired it up a little after neglecting it for a long time. There are 16 more. And there are shift registers and so on. I don't think it was such a mistake to buy it, but it was a big mistake to solder it to the board first. I should have wired around it first. It was too much of a mess.

 At this point, we confirmed that each row of LEDs is separately attached and that the solder does not bridge the LEDs.
 
 How do I connect this to the breadboard... I bought the pins, but if I put them on the bottom of the board, the plastic will be in the way and I can't solder, if I put them on the top, the LEDs will face the breadboard, and if I put them through from the top down, the legs won't be long enough. I wonder if they sell longer pins. I wonder if they sell longer pins.

 The interpretation of <body>% is up to the MTA. I've never heard of the "care of" theory, by the way. <br>And if you are going to talk about this, please look into the UUCP syntax of putting the bang path to the left of the @. <br>(e.g., uunet!reseau!kenji@uunet.uu.net ← This address is invalid, so don't use it now)</body>.

 <body>No, I was just using the symbols that I often see in email addresses, without regard to their position, as appropriate. <BR>Because in the past I usually saw source routing notation. <br>%The reason why the destination (business trip) tended to go at the end was because it was a normal foo@bar addition, and also because foo@Honya University.

 <body>percent hack is exactly hack, just a convention that is not in RFC 821. Interpretation is up to the MTA. Even now qmail, exim and (of course) sendmail can enable percent hack in their configurations. <BR><BR>In addition, calling the percent hack "source routing" seems to be a misuse of the TCP/IP analogy: the source route notation in SMTP is something like "@fqdn1,@fqdn2:user@fqdn3". <br><br>The formal notation for specifying a route is here. <br><br>The current RFC 2821 states that servers MUST read this notation, but SHOULD ignore the route, or MAY reject the specified relay, or MAY reject mail with other hosts as the final destination. </body>
