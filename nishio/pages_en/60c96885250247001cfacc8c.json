>Fourth, with regard to the issue of "corporate structure and culture," we often observed a weak attitude toward deterring and resolving problems through proactive and voluntary actions beyond the scope of one's own position in the event of a contingency such as the failure. In addition, there were situations in which the respondents refrained from speaking up and taking action when the full details of the disorder and its impact on customers were not completely clear, assuming that there was a risk.
> The reason for the lack of such a proactive and voluntary attitude among executives and employees may be due to the corporate culture, in which it is more rational for an organization to act as if it had done what it could do at its own location rather than take the risk of becoming a liability issue by proactively raising its voice, This may be because of the "corporate culture" in the organization.
