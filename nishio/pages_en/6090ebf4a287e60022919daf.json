 *1198470863*Today is December 24th
 It seems to be closed.
 
 I had planned to take Friday off with pay, Saturday off, Sunday off, Monday in, Tuesday off with pay, but it turned out to be five days in a row.

 Oh, I wish I could have gone....
 If I had two bodies, I would have gone.
 Basically, I'm not a fan of crowds and terra chaos, so when I found out about the double booking, I chose the event on the side with fewer people.
 
 >>
 It's like the fashionable hairdressing products that Soft on Demand has released in recent years.

 I wonder if the fashionable hair dresser, which looks like a rice cake with seven spices, was given to amachang.
 
 *1198476668* It's already 3am.
 You can go to the coffee shop Renoir in Akihabara to write, and if you get a lot of work done, you can buy GEO MAG on the way home. If not, don't buy it. How about this?
 
 The reward driven has been "you can buy a MIDI instrument when you are done writing," but I thought I should reward in more detailed increments because the writing will never be finished.
 I want someone to praise me when I clean my room.
 
 *1198483183*About a program to paste presentation screen to Lingr
 If I take the 25th off with pay, I'm not sure I can organize it and get it ready to try out (and take measures to keep it from being "weird") and publish it, since I'll have to go on the 26th, 27th, and 28th to prepare for the move and all that. And my interest has already been reflected in something else.
 
 Robot in Java, save it to a stream, and POST it to the server using Commons' HttpClient or something like that. The server saves it in a directory visible from the outside (/htdocs/presen_cast/ or something like that) and then posts the URL to Lingr. If it is an image, Lingr will automatically fetch it and paste it as a thumbnail.
 
 If you have already done the part where you upload the screenshot to the server, then all you have to do is throw the URL to Lingr, which I think can be written in less than 10 lines of Python. ï¼žtgbt

 *1198483693*About my work at Cybozu Labs
 I'm often asked the question, but I can't always answer it well.
 This time, I came up with a slightly better way to explain it, so I'll make a note of it.
 
 >>
 My job at Cybozu Labs is to create one "something innovative" in three years. To achieve this, I have to create 10 "services/technologies that can be released and used" in three years. And to achieve this, 100 "prototypes" must be created in three years. And to come up with 1,000 "new ideas" in 3 years for that purpose.
 
 Conversely, to come up with 1,000 ideas in 3 years, create 100, release 10, and make 1 innovation.
 <<
 
 Since innovation cannot be targeted, I think this is the only way to do it. In fact, we should learn 10,000 "existing ideas" in order to come up with 1,000 "new ideas," but we have not caught up there yet.
 
 -----
 
 Oh, what a lot of bookmarks.... Just to clarify, there is no such quota, I was never told "your job is ____" until now since I joined the company in April, and I came to the above conclusion after 8 months of thinking about what my job is.
 
 *1198489301* Written by.
 I'm not getting anywhere!
 
 Considering the code that was written and the development in the next section, it would be more straightforward to change the way the methods are separated to make the explanation more straightforward. Rewriting.
 
 It is not good to be too idealistic and never finish. I want to finish chapter 6 today. Two hours to go. I don't think I'll be able to finish.
 
 Wow, it says Gumouski when Gumowski is correct!
 
 Oh, if you think the behavior doesn't change after overriding it, it's private.
 
 If I set it to protected, I could dynamically create a new class at runtime that inherits from the class and override the draw method to change its behavior.
 
 what is static and what is not
 I don't care if it's static or not because I don't create multiple instances in the explanation flow to begin with, but if readers create multiple instances in the future, it would be more convenient to use a singleton approach and share one instance of Jython rather than creating one instance of Jython for each of them. But if you don't include it, you might be bothered by the fact that it might be strange when you create multiple instances of Jython. If it is not included in the code, it might make me worry about it.
 
 I'm getting hungry.
 
 I've made a lot of mistakes. I thought it would be too much to ask readers to check out the source code on the CD with TortoiseSVN, so I used sequential file names, but that made my burden to maintain the integrity of all the files explode. I wondered how many readers would want to read all the files in the revision process. There aren't. I should have developed the files without sequential numbering and just taken out the first and last or something later.
 
 I'll go home and put it in the repository and rewrite it. It's a hassle to look at the differences of modifications if I had been managing sequentially numbered file names. I'll only proceed with the Japanese version first.
 
 *1198502992*I'm back.
 I didn't get as far as buying the geomags with lots of them, but I did get some done, so I bought a 21-pack of the colored ones, and I wondered why there were 21 of them when there are 4 colors, but there are only a few green ones. Now I'm going to buy the one with lots of green.
 
 When I returned home, I found 17 Hatena bookmarks on the text I wrote after escaping from writing at Renoir. I was depressed.
 
 *1198504302*IT Woman Warrior
 Hatsune Miku also utilized: One Eve, hanging on to IT - ITmedia News

 The IT female warrior is starting to look like Jin Katagiri.
 
 *1198505313* tomorrow
 Tomorrow is a private meeting at a hotel 12 minutes from Mizonokuchi Station for a social gathering of the Unexplored Wada Project and the Unexplored Youth 3D-related projects. It's only 23:00, but I'm sleepy, so I'll go to bed and get up quickly; I have to leave here by 12:00 to make it in time.
