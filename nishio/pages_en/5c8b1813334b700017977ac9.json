Oblivious Transfer
Table pulling can be done with encryption.

Alice wants to do a table pull with m, but does not want to tell m to Bob who has table T.
 Bob should have a method that can compute Enc(m) → Enc(T(m))
	Of course Bob can't Enc(m)→m

If you want to send m, make m "a one-hot vector where only the mth is 1 and the rest are 0" and enc each element of the vector
	Enc(0) will of course have a different value

The table pull is the inner product of this one-hot vector.
If Enc is a quasi-isomorphic cipher, the inner product can be computed.

Ten years ago there were no quasi-isomorphic ciphers that could be multiplied.
A perfect quasi-isomorphic cipher was born.
That's computationally heavy, so "quasi-isomorphic ciphers that can be multiplied only once" were born.

What to do if you want to take a value from a 2D table
	In an additive-only quasi-homomorphic cipher, two indices are combined to form an index, like 256x+y.
		Possible, but costly if the table is X * Y in size, since the message length is also X * Y
	Can be neatly done in a quasi-homomorphic cipher where multiplication can be done once.
		If the product of two indices can be computed, because only where "both are 1" is there left a 1.
