Dinic speed
The computational complexity of [Dinic] is O(V^2E), and when E is proportional to V, V=10000, it seems that it cannot be solved, but it is considered "faster in reality", and in fact it is fast, then how fast is it?

	[Dinic method and its time complexity - Misawamemo https://misawa.github.io/others/flow/dinic_time_complexity.html]
		Computational complexity is reduced under some conditions when the side capacity is an integer.
 		When maximum flow is F [$ O(FE)].
 		When the capacity of an edge is at most C [$ O(C E^{3/2})].
 		　and no multiple edges [$ O(CV^{2/3}E)].
 		When the flow through each vertex is at most F [$ O(FV^{1/2}E)].
 		　Solving bipartite matching with maximum flow corresponds to the case F=1 above
 	For implementations using dynamic trees, for general graphs [$ O(VE\log V)].

　If the edge capacity is constant [$ O(\min \{ E^{1/2}, V^{2/3} \} E)] [PDF https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dinitz/Papers/Dinitz_alg.pdf]
