	I bought [shoes] that let me feel the unevenness of the ground.

	This feels really good!

		 I wrote that this one feels really good, too, but I can't tell the difference in the picture.
		 I have green bamboo at home, but honestly it is boring compared to this. There are countless variations out in the park.

   >I'm glad you finally got the messageðŸ˜Š.
   >So when you walk around in Vibram Five Fingers every day, you don't need a foot massage.
	In addition, there was the trap of not realizing that the hems of the trousers were now touching the ground due to the large change in shoe height, and getting covered in mud!
ã€€ >Kazuhiro Shiozawa: When we tailor suits, we ask our customers to wear Vibram Five Fingers shoes to take their measurements, because we don't want them to wear leather shoes.

	I have been wearing Vibram Five Fingers for a little over a week now, and what used to be a rambling "my soles don't feel good, I want to step on green bamboo and massage them" has loosened up, and as a result, I have a clearer idea of where the problem is. It seems that the muscle crossing the sole of my left foot is tight.
	Compared to the shoes I had been wearing, I found that I had not been able to move my fingers and ankles much with the shoes on. I also realized that when I stepped on the green bamboo, there was no movement in the direction of rounding my foot vertically because of its cylindrical shape.
	 >Kazuhiro Shiozawa: I heard that human beings, by nature, curl up vertically when climbing a tree. Modern people can only hold a tree between their legs, can't they? It is because of our shoes. According to Dr. Jun Kaneko.
  Rather than stepping on green bamboos of a certain shape indoors, "taking a walk and stepping on a stump" outdoors is more effective in relaxing the feet, perhaps because the blood circulation is better after the feet have been moved. The fact that the roots of the trees in the park are in various shapes also stimulates the feet in various ways, and one is forced to try stepping here and there in search of just the right one, thus adding various kinds of massage to the feet.
 But the problem of the tightness of the sole muscle of my left foot due to my long-standing habit of walking, etc., does not go away in a week. As a result, it remains unresolved and is noticeable.
	 I don't think it's anything like [plantar fasciitis], but it's in the exact area where it's located. As someone who doesn't exercise much, I think it's more likely that I haven't moved it too much in the past, rather than that the inflammation was caused by too high an exercise load. It would be better to do it gradually while resting it so that the inflammation doesn't get worse.

	The concern I had before putting them on that they might be cold is actually cold when I come out of the building on a winter night. As soon as I walk, they warm up. The blood flow in my feet feels much better. Even in a foot massage sense, I feel better on a daily basis as the blood flow in my feet has improved and the "lumps" and "lumps" have flowed away and I feel better.
	 How it is during the rainy season has not been tested.
		 Well, but even my previous MBTs didn't wear them in the rain, so there's no difference.
 I don't know how it is for runners, but for me, at the "too much exercise, let's walk once in a while" level, they seem to be better than the shoes I've been wearing.
	 Even when you're sitting on a bench instead of walking, it's easier to turn your ankle.
 Oh, and I'm talking about the fact that tree roots are good because, unlike green bamboo, they are not cylindrical, and you can step on a golf ball or something, but compared to that, they have the advantage of being "firmly fixed and not moving around if you step on them outside the center of your foot".

		ã€€Stepping on the bump in the center of the screen has a golf ball-like effect, but it does not roll like a golf ball, so you can step on it without worry.
	>Kazuhiro Shiozawa:.
  > If you get pain in the arch of your foot, please take it easy and stretch it well. I sometimes get pain when I walk too much. If I stretch it, it will recover in a couple of days. I walk slowly until the pain subsides.
  > If you have been wearing shoes other than Vibram FiveFingers, your ankles and the joints below must be stiff and stiff, so it is important to stretch each joint sufficiently to make them flexible.
