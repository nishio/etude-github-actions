reverse inheritance
>Every time I see a page in Scrapbox that does not yet exist but is referenced from multiple pages (text color is orange), I am reminded of C++'s [abstract class]. The order is originally reversed, but the abstract class is found by tracing back from a subclass that exists first (reverse inheritance?). The abstract class is allocated from the subclass that exists first (reverse inheritance?). In short, it is [abstraction].

	Interesting choice of words.
 Inheritance] in programming means that a lower class inherits the members of a higher class, but [reverse inheritance] means that a higher class is created after a lower class = collection of concrete examples.
