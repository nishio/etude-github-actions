2021-07-23 Diary
If I titled it "2021-07-23," it would get mixed up in context with the recent Movidea development that was written in that format.

Developing" is also a diary, and relaxing on a day off is also a diary.

Maybe it would be more appropriate to call the one I'm developing "Development Diary" or "Movidea Diary".

Be that as it may, today is just a diary.
　40th Birthday
　10th wedding anniversary
　Working from home for about a year and a half due to an infectious disease outbreak.
　Second day of consecutive holidays moved to Tokyo for the Tokyo Olympics
　　It was originally a Friday weekday, but it felt like a Sunday.
　I heard the opening ceremony is today, but I don't know what's going to happen.
