Small PDCA that can be turned by one person and large PDCA that involves others
[https://gyazo.com/696072d3ab5dd891c1a8c0194605cbf1]
 The [PDCA cycle] that can be turned by one person can be turned smaller and faster.
 To involve others, [output] is necessary.
 Others don't move the way you expect them to, so they tend to move big and slow.
 　Rarely do you get someone who responds with more enthusiasm than you, but that's just luck, and median people are all less enthusiastic than you.
 　　Tends to be a long wait for results
 　You never know how others will react to your output (Do) unless you try.
 　 So this cycle is also a PDCA cycle of experimentation and verification

[Output]
　[Social Trigger]
