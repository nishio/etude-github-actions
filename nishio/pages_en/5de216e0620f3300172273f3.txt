Shutter one beat slower than reality

	Talk about how to take the moment when the pendulum comes right down.
	Humans have a delay in reaction to seeing and then pressing a button.
		When "seeing reality and taking pictures with an optical camera" and "seeing the monitor and taking pictures with a digital camera
			If the pendulum is pushed only after seeing that it has come directly under the pendulum, it will be delayed.
			So you need to push a little faster.
	Digital cameras lag behind humans.
		When "seeing reality and taking pictures with a digital camera"
			If you press it after you see it come directly below you, you can still get an image before it comes directly below you.
			In this situation, you need to push a little slower.
				I felt it was necessary to delay one beat as a skin sensation.
				250 ms, so it was a good approximation.

	Practice shooting the lowest point of a moving swing with the iPhone11ProMax camera ([Facebook https://www.facebook.com/nishiohirokazu/posts/10219958183641482])
		I was looking at the screen and taking pictures early on, and when I switched to the naked eye, it didn't show up at all.

		If you are not willing to train your body's sense of timing (you want the machine to feel good)
			Don't look at the screen or look away once you've just composed the image → Timing is determined by looking at reality, not the screen.
			If resolution is important, shoot in burst (3024 × 4032, 100msec)
			Turn to 4K video recording (2160 × 3840, 33msec) if timing consistency (resolution in time axis) is important.
			In both cases, the senses can shoot faster than human reaction time.

		Eventually, with higher resolution, there will come a time when "video is all that's needed.
