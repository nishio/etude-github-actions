Choose a heroic ideal.

Choose heroic ideals, but emulate rather than imitate. There is an example of greatness, a living textbook of honor. Let everyone put the head of his vocation before his heart, not to follow him, but to impel himself. Alexander wept, not because of the death and burial of Achilles, but because his fame had not yet spread to the world. Nothing arouses more ambition in the heart than the trumpet blast of another's fame. The same thing that sharpens jealousy nourishes a generous spirit.
