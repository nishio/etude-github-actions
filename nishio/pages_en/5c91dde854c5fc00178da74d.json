Memo 20190320.
[Psychological Safety and Vein]
[Writing for my own understanding].

When speaking, some people aim to "move people to do what they want" while others aim to "transfer knowledge.
	The former try to speak directly to individual people and say different things to different people.
	That's why I don't want it published.

Writing can be done without a partner.
Write to organize your thoughts
In the past, when the cost of publicly sharing written material was high, "writing and publishing" required strong intent.
One of its intentions was to "move people."
But costs have come down.
Times when it is possible to publish as written to organize thoughts.
The purpose of writing is to organize thoughts, and I am satisfied when I write, and I am not really interested in what others do with it after it is published.
	Then the counterargument can be made that we don't have to disclose it.
	Some are concerned that public disclosure will cause a firestorm or be used for internal politics.
