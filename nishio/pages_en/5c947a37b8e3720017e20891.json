Cross-linking
	I'm struggling with the granularity of [bracketing].
		`Information sharing` as a link or `information` and `sharing`?
		There is also an emergent pattern of `sharing information` and `sharing information` that I want to fine-tune.
	But now [Scrapbox] specs show articles containing `info` or `share` as links
		This is equivalent to searching with OR
		Fear that the linkage target is too broad.
	Wouldn't it be nice if AND links ([multiply links]) were created automatically?
	If a keyword X or Y appears on too many pages to list, display "X and Y" before them
