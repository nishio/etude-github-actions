 *131313498218*Presentations by participants of the Security & Programming Camp 2011 Language Classes
 I thought it would be easier to follow the participants' presentations and blog posts if there was a summary entry, so I made one for now. If there are any omissions or mistakes in the explanations, please point them out. I don't have a complete list of all the participants yet.
 
 ** @syamino
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/syamino/20110813/1313194749'>シャミノ計算 - Meta reifier</a>
 - Representing untyped lambda calculations in term rewriting systems
 
 ** @Tomoki_Imai
 - <a href='http://tomokisilfa.wordpress.com/2011/08/15/%e3%82%bb%e3%82%ad%e3%83%a5%e3%83%aa%e3%83%86%e3%82%a3%e3%83%97%e3%83%ad%e3%82%b0%e3%83%a9%e3%83%9f%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b0%e3%82%ad%e3%83%a3%e3%83%b3%e3%83%972011%e3%82%92%e4%bf%ae%e4%ba%86%e3%81%97/'>セキュリティ&プログラミングキャンプ2011を修了しました。 &#171; Silfa and PC</a>
 - I created a new language PRPR. It reads "Pero Pero."
 - Pre-process in Python and parse in Ruby Racc
 - Indentation to represent blocks
 
 ** @i315
 - <a href='http://www.slideshare.net/itochan315/ss-8846035'>Faster by creating extended libraries</a>
 - Implementation of popcount to count the number of standing bits in a sequence of bytes
 - The presentation was so laugh-out-loud funny, including the narrative, that I'd like to have it presented somewhere in public.
 
 ** @Glass_saga
 - <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Glass_saga/20110815/1313393315?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter'>Participated in Security & Programming Camp 2011 I did - Glass_saga</a>.
 - Ruby has a Ruby script called prelude that is executed when the processor is started, which is embedded in the binary in the form of Ruby, so the parsing and compilation of that script is running at startup.
 - Can't we speed up startup by embedding this in a pre-compiled form? I'm talking about that.
 - After precompiling and other research, we concluded that we need to create a fast bytecode serializer.
 
 ** @itsuki_kosen 
 - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/itsukichang/spcamp2011lang-itsukichang">Visualization of Ruby method definition source</a>.
 - When a Ruby method defined in C is called, it is difficult to know where the definition is.
 - The API that registers C functions as Ruby methods was hacked and modified to output the value of the pointer to the C function, the method name, and the C function name.
 - Changed so that when Ruby VM executes a method call instruction, it outputs the value of the pointer to the C function it is about to call.
 - Use the data at definition time and addr2line to calculate backward from the pointer value the function name, method name, file and line number, and visualize it in ActionScript.
 
 ** @kazh98
 - <a href='http://kazh98.blog.shinobi.jp/Entry/8/'>Get better day by day.　Where is Our Unknown Utopia?</a>: 言語処理系の作成
 - The problem is that BASIC does not have variable scopes. Let's add it.
 - Added scopes and anonymous functions, and simplified the syntax while we're at it.
 - It's not BASIC by any means, thank you very much!
 
 ** @niku_uchi
 - <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/niku_uchi/20110815'>二重for構文の追加</a>
 - I tweaked the Ruby parser and compiler to add a new for2 syntax that loops over two subscripts

 -Implementation of a functional language and Brainf*ck in that language

 <body>Erm, is your name your Twitter ID? If so, my Twitter ID is @phi16_. <br>And I think your ID is also different from fukinotou's - I think it is @butterbur331. </body> <br><br
