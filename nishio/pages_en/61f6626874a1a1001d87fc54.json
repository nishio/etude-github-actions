You don't need to know everything about everything.
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
You don't need to know everything about everything.

Make your behavior respectable and noble.
lxxxviii 

A great man should not be small in his behavior. He should not pry too closely into details, especially in matters that are unpleasant. For while it is important to know everything, it is not necessary to know everything about everything. In such cases, we should act in a manner befitting a gentlemanly tolerance and a brave man. Overlooking is a large part of the work of domination. Most things must be overlooked, whether among relatives, friends, or enemies. Everything superfluous is a nuisance, especially in that which annoys. It is a kind of mania to keep hovering around an object that annoys or annoys you. Generally speaking, we all act according to our own mind and understanding.
