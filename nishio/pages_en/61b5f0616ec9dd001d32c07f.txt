Mathematical model in which relationships determine meaning
When the meaning is a vector of higher dimensions, the relationship is determined by the operations between the vectors.
　This is the mathematical model found in [word2vec] and others
　If the vectors are orthogonal, there is no relationship.

As [Eugene Gendlin] pointed out, association determines meaning.
　What kind of mathematical model is this?
　These two symbols are related, and are passed
　　[CIRCUMLOCUTION].
　But this is what word2vec does internally.
　　The word "this word is related" is presented with the co-occurrence of the word in the window.
