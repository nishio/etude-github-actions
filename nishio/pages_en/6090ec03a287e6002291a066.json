 *1265690117*A story of trouble when I got tickets for 7 people on JAL.
 Take airline tickets for seven people, including a friend, because you have enough money available on your credit card.
 
 >>
 A communication error occurred during the credit card authorization process, so automatic payment could not be made.
 Based on the credit card information you have entered, we will later perform the authorization procedure again and ship your ticket after the payment has been made.
 If the payment cannot be made for some reason even after another authorization procedure, we will contact you to discuss how to handle the situation. We appreciate your understanding.

 What? What?

 I go to check the amount available on my credit card just to be sure. Oh, it's down, I thought you got it right.
 
 My friend said, "Huh? Isn't the amount of decrease strange?" I said, "Indeed! Something is missing in the amount of decrease! Why? Was it partially deducted?"
 
 <hr>
 
 My friend called JAL and confirmed, "I got only 4 out of 7 people. I will call you back later.
 
 What? Three other people happened to reserve the seat you were trying to take at the same time? What do you mean?
 
 <hr>
 
 Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Phone. "Rakuten KC. We've received seven payments in a row with the same details. Yes!
 
 I see, so that's how it is...JAL somehow split the cost of tickets for 7 people into 7 separate payments in a row instead of charging them all at once, and Rakuten KC deemed it to be an unusual payment. I wonder why they didn't charge in a lump sum. It's a mystery.
