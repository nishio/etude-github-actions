 LastUpdated is 0 by default
 When a map is loaded from the server, if the lastUpdate of the data is older than the lastUpdate on hand, the screen is not updated.
 Forgot to update lastUpdated on load.
 As a result, when I do "load the map and save as" without editing, I get data with lastUpdated of 0.
 When this is loaded, there is no screen refresh because there are 0 on hand and 0 loaded.
revision (e.g. of a rule, regulation, etc.)
　Update lastUpdated on load
　Since broken data with lastUpdated of 0 has already been created, overwrite it with the current time if 0 as a workaround.
