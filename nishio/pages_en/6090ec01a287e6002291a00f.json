 Someone gets a bug on it or something, and if you remove the bug, the yield is said to increase up to twice as much.
 
 Seed purchase price, harvest, time to maturity (min), revenue per hour

 Carrots 2, 5, 45, 4.0
 Pumpkin 15, 37.5, 7h30, 3.0

 I don't understand how to gain experience to level up. Watering is +1, removing pests is +0.5, going from level 1 to 2 is 25, going from level 2 to 3 is 200, etc. There was a notation that harvesting from someone else's field would increase the experience range, so I tried to see if that was true, but it didn't. I thought it would be more advantageous if we harvested from each other's fields, but it doesn't seem so. I thought that it would be more advantageous if we both took crops from each other's fields, but it doesn't seem so.
 
 The same +0.5 experience is gained when removing insects from other people's crops as is gained when removing naturally occurring pests.
 
 Shoveling on already harvested land is also +0.5; planting seeds is +0.5.

 Corn 15, 50, 9H, 3.9
 Tomatoes 34, 75, 10.5, 3.9
 Eggplant 43, 100, 13, 4.4
 Apples 79, 200, 15.5, 7.8
 Tangerine 498, 1200, 64, 11.0

 As for the non-pumpkins, I can see that as the level increases, the time required for growth generally increases and the revenue per unit of time also increases.
 
 At 30 for regular fertilizer, it can reduce growing time by one hour. Well, doesn't it pay off? No wonder. If you use insects to double the yield, you can subtract 64 * 30 = 1920 from the 2400 tangerine harvest, plus 498 for the cost of the seeds, and you end up with -18.
 
 They say you can put on up to 100 bugs a day. So you can give a total of 50 experience to others.

 At any rate, I guess the right way to speedily accumulate experience in the early stages is to rotate the carrots as much as possible in the six squares without planting the apples and whatnot that you received.

 PS: Oh my gosh, I get 0.5 experience per coin on the sales of crops when they are sold? So it's right to simply make money all the time?
 
 Huh. I don't understand how you get experience when you sell.

 After 6 minutes, the game became inoperable. The total playing time was 6 minutes and 17 seconds, Level: 26, Score: 11520. It might be a good time to take a break. It uses different parts of my brain. I'm looking for challengers.
