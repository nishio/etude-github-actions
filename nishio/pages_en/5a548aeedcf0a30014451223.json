  >When asked if they could "devote some of their time, budget, and other resources" to so-called underground research, which designers undertake at their own discretion, only 9.1% said that "underground research is allowed as a system," but 50.3% said that "it is not a system, but it is practically possible if you use after-hours hours, etc. However, 50.3% of the respondents answered that "it is not institutionalized, but it is practically possible if one uses after-hours hours, etc.", while only 24.0% answered "it is not possible", indicating a surprisingly high degree of freedom in research topics.
