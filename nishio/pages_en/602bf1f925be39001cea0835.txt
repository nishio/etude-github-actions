plate clip
When we say plate clip, it is ambiguous what we mean
 [Plate 1 x 1 - Vertical clip] 4085
 	Plate, Modified 1 x 1 with Clip Vertical
 [Plate 1 x 1 horizontal clip] 6019
 	Plate, Modified 1 x 1 with U Clip (Horizontal Grip)
 [Plate 1 x 2 horizontal clip 63863
 	Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Clip on End (Horizontal Grip)
 [Plate 1 x 2 - single clip]
	 [Plate 1 x 2 clips] 92280
 	Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Clip on Top

I once mistakenly wrote "plate clip" for [tile 1 x 1 - clip
