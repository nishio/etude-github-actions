 If you take a picture of the QR code here with your cell phone and download the applet, you can take a picture of the barcode of the book with your cell phone and register it. I imagined that I had to repeat "take a picture, operate the applet, and so on", but it was easy because I could take pictures of barcodes one after another without going back to the original applet screen after I took a picture. At first, I was holding the phone over the book, which made it blurry and difficult to recognize the barcode, but after a little ingenuity, I was able to take pictures quickly and easily. I also tried to take a picture from the top of the book.
 
 If you send a batch of photos after taking them, a list will appear on the page below, where you can set whether or not to publish them, or whether or not to read them. I heard that you can change the settings later.

 And this is my page that I made anyway.

 Maybe tomorrow I'll take a picture of the stack of books in my office.
