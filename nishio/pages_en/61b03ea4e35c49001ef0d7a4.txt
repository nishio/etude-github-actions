Understanding is thinking within a mold.
[Phenomenology as non-logical steps]
 >When we precisely understand its formed intricacy, that is just when we exceed its forms. When we don't understand a book, we can only quote it. To understand it is to [dwell-think] in its forms, and that is more precise than the forms.
	>(DeepL)If you cannot understand a book, you have to quote it. To understand it is to think within its form, which is more precise than the form.
	　[nishio.icon]Translation: we do not have to surrender to "what is already structured. When we understand a complex structure accurately, that is the moment to go beyond that structure. When we read a book and do not understand it, we can only quote it. To understand a book is to dwell-think within its structure, which is a more accurate understanding than the written structure.

[When you don't understand a book, all you can do is quote it].

from [phenomenology as an illogical stage] in [experiential processes and the creation of meaning].
　>When we understand exactly the complexity that has been formed, when it transcends its form
　　>[When you don't understand something, you can only quote it].
　　　[nishio.icon]That's exactly me right now.
　　>Understanding means to be "[dwelling - thinking]" "in" the form
　　　>This is a more accurate understanding than "keeping" the formality.
　　　I associate [nishio.icon][defensive breakdown].
　　　　When you don't understand, you can only follow [the pattern].
　　　　When understood accurately, the mold is broken.
　　　　The machine translation translated "form" as "shape" but changed it to "type.
			Understood: ["Dwelling" and Kozane Law].
				Do you really understand?
				　How do we know if we "got it exactly right?"

　In ["Residence" and "Kozane Method"], I wrote
　　>"By creating a pseudo "symbolic space for the other party" through the placement of sticky notes, and then "inhabiting" the space through activities within it!
　To verify if this "understanding = hypothesis" is correct, we put it into practice and observed the results.
　　Specifically, I worked to transform Heidegger's own "[to build, to live, to think]" into a space without distorting its symbols.
　　　 [Kozaneba:dwell-think]
　　The conclusion, in a word, is half right, half wrong with my representation.
　　　The meaning of the word "live" was much more abstract than initially imagined.
　　This would be more interesting if it were firmly verbalized instead of just one word.

	Firmly verbalized: [to build, to live, to think].
