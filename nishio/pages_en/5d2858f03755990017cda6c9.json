[Phylogenetic tree]
  Since the fragments will go into multiple projects, it will be interesting to see the phylogenetic tree as the fragments evolve within each project."

  　I was imagining only "which map is used" as [detailed information].
  　Maybe it would be interesting to see how they interacted with other stickies over time.
