Observations on how children use touch devices when they are allowed to use them
	Instead of dragging the object, place your finger across the object and try to pull it with your stomach
 If something moves that you don't want to move, try to stop it by holding it with your other hand.
 If rubbing your finger on it will give it color, I'm sure pressing your hand on it will give you a handprint.
	I think you can move multiple pieces together by rubbing them with the belly of your hand.

I see. It's hard to create an "intuitive UI.
