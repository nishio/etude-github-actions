　Thoughts.
　　1,3,2 for 3
　　What if it's 4?
　　　How should we think about it?
　　　Total value is SN
　　　Another way to count this is to distribute XY around the perimeter if the rank X and the value Y
　　　That is, if the rank is Di
　　　	[$ \sum_i iD_i = SN]
　　　When all ranks are 1, the left-hand side is 10 and the right-hand side is 4s
　　　Adding one more edge increases the number of places by two.
　　　If you want to go for 16, just connect 2 and 4.
　　　1,2,4,3
　　　This is missing 1 and 3.
　　　Connect these and you'll get 4 more, just fine.
　　What if it's 5?
　　　S is greater than N
　　　　Otherwise, the vertex connected to N cannot wait for further edges because it will be N at that point, violating the condition of concatenation
　　　　　The exception is when the network has N as a hub and the non-N sum is also N. This is only true when 3.
　　　　There is no vertex with rank 1.
　　　　 →A
　　　The only time it cycles is when 4.
　　　　Since a+c=c+e cannot be satisfied in a,b,c,d,e.
　　　A: So it's not so much "where's the edge" as "where's not."
　　　　At 3, 1-2
　　　　At 4, 1-4, 2,3
　　　　At 5, the sum is 14-10 if it is a perfect graph.
　　　　 1-4, 2-3, all together make 10.
　　　　At 6, 20-15
　　　　 1-5, 2-4, oh, I got an extra 3.
　　　　 To begin with, 15 is not a multiple of 6.
　　　　 If you want to align to 12, 15 is -3.
　　　　 Hmmm, not easy.
　Something to think about again after some time.
　　Consider the complete graph
　　The sum of the numbers of the adjacent vertices of each vertex is then [$ f(x)=\sum_i i - x].
　　When N is even, if x and N+1-x are connected [$ f'(x)=\sum_i i - x - (N + 1 - x) = \sum_i i - (N + 1)] and constant regardless of x
　　Odd times are a problem.
　　[https://gyazo.com/e76108ab5d4311843730df54423d5dc2]
　　If we connect x and N-x with respect to 1~N-1, we get [$ f'(x)=\sum_i i - x - (N - x) = \sum_i i - N], constant regardless of x
　　For N [$ f(x) = \sum_i i - x = \sum_i i - N ], so still the same value
