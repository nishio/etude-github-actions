Create a map with the lecture slides poured in.
 PDF Import
 	[Image sticky note]
		Create a map with 100 lecture slides poured into it (with in-app data).
			Added the ability to import multiple lines of text at once, rather than creating dedicated data in the app.
				[Import multi-line text as individual stickies]
		Whether it moves at a realistic speed
			[- Redrawing every time you move on the PC appears to blink].
				It should be displayed after rendering is done, so it's not right to blink.
					It's asynchronous because the Raster is drawn onLoad.
				This was resolved by setting the position outside of onLoad
				When you load an image that doesn't fit the size of the sticky, it'll be written bigger and then smaller.
		Experiment with iPad
 	Consider whether to screen for demonstration
 		Just make one for now, and if it doesn't look like it's suitable for a demo, just use a different URL.
 	Instead of creating a function to Upload PDFs, first use the list of images already on the server.
