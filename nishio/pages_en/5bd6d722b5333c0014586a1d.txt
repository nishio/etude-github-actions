Introduction.
Welcome to Scrapbox. You can freely edit and utilize this page.

[[Invite members to this project]]
	You can get a link to invite others from Menu -> Members.
 Scrapbox allows multiple people to collaboratively edit the same page in real time.

[[Try Basic Usage]]
	Paragraphs can be created with tabs or spaces at the beginning of lines.
 Enclose `[[ ]]` to make it [[bold]].
 Enclose `[ ]` to [link] to [another page].
 Any text after the `#` becomes a #hashtag. It works the same as a link.
 You can display images and videos by writing image URLs such as Gyazo or video URLs from Youtube/Vimeo in `[ ]`.
 	Example: The
  	[https://gyazo.com/5f93e65a3b979ae5333aca4f32600611]
	Set up a personal profile and create your own page (Menu -> Edit profile). After that,
 	Type `Ctrl+I` or write `[myusername.icon]` to embed the icon.
  You can iconize any page, not just your own. Example: [Introduction.icon].
