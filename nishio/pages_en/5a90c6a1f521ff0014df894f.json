Do "not move."
 Think of it not as "stuck" but as "doing the stuck."
 Recovery is faster when you think, "I can't move" than when you think, "I have to move or I won't move.
 Self-blame" (i.e., "I wanted to do this, I should have done this, but I didn't") is counterproductive.
 	If you can't stop on your own, meds.
 Books, movies, and games use thinking, so rest the brain with music, incense, baths, and eye-warming products.
