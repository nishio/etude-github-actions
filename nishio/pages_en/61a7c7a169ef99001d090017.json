Eye of Emptiness
I was thinking about self-display in VR space.
　In the first place, physical localization is an old generation idea.
　　Isn't it not good enough to go to the trouble of mimicking the localization that is characteristic of matter in a world without physical constraints?

You want to be [the eye of the void]?
　Eyes open when and where you want to see them, and close and disappear when you lose interest.
　When you want to operate, a hand comes out of the void.
　https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus

Rather, the main body is a pyramid?
　No, no, it is not self.
　The eyes and hands that arise and disappear temporarily are the self, while the pyramid was there originally and will be there after the disappearance of the eyes.
　　A hand appears when you want to do something to it.
　My eyes open and close, and one day they won't open anymore.

　Pyramid is not self-displaying, yet what is valuable in this picture is the pyramid
　　Ah, well, homo sapiens implicitly tend to think of the self as "valuable".
　　[Is it related to the idea that humans are just fragile parts that will only operate for a hundred years or so?

Does this mean that you recognize as "self-display" a mark that indicates the "object you are interested in now" that changes from time to time, rather than some kind of "self" that does not change?
