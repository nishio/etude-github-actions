	I want to feel good about my knowledge.
		How do you define "nice"?
		Not looking good right now.
			You're stuck on the P in [nishio.icon][PRO Model].
		Book format old-fashioned
			Can I read a book?
			Shouldn't a better way be created in this day and age?
		Table of Contents
			[Civil law map]
		The assumption that a human being is going to read it is wrong in the first place.
			What kind of things does AI read?
		search (e.g. for someone using a search engine)
			Keywords → Text
			[Inverted index]
			This should evolve.
			Man must create keywords.
			Poorly derived results from keywords
			When humans interact, they are not searching by keywords.
				Groupware, Experience, Books, Yahoo Chieftaincy
				Return a proposed course of action with the situation as input?
				Example
					Want to improve poor customer attraction
					Ask your instructor to help you attract customers."
					I don't want to ask the instructor to attract customers.
					→Action proposal: Instead of making a request (instruction for action), why not share information on the current situation?
				Issues need to be verbalized.
				This activity is too advanced and is far beyond the system we are trying to create now.
			Generation? Abstraction?
		It is impossible for a human being to read all the groupware, experiences, books, Yahoo Wisdom
			We need a presence that reads everything instead.
			Brain emulator: [the human live brain is inferior and needs to be replaced].

	What's the point of reading a book and highlighting it?
		Discovering a sharp expression of what was already in me
		Read books and learn new things
		Read and make sense of the time difference.
		People are different."
			I used to, but then one day I got hooked and started to get passionate about it.
		[human bug]."
			It was already noted in Scrapbox.
			After a time, I realized how "important and interesting" it was.
				[quotes are context dependent].
		Why is Drucker so interesting?
			Bring about a change in mental models
			Drucker does not explain by quotation
				My observations and reflections
				It was written in the textbooks." Lame.
				The association defines "~" as "~." That's lame.
				[FALSE OBJECTIVITY].
				⇔ Not [properly subjective].
					a decent subjectivity that springs from the belly
				You have to create your own words to make it interesting.

	I want to emulate subjectivity.
		Collecting subjectivity
		Interesting subjectivity.
		Need psychological safety?
		I won't be offended if you express what you think (i.e., subjective).
	People need subjectivity to be interested.
		⇔ objective
			Search = "~ contains keyword X"
			Analysis = "Keyword X appears N times in ~"
		Even if objective specs are good, "boring" will get you NG.
			Majority people love subjectivity.
	It would be interesting if the listening chat system became subjective.
		What are the specifics?
			preferences
				Propagation from parents to some extent
				Is subjectivity created by likes and dislikes?
				No single system, but a system of individual differences
				A bot that looks at all your Twitter posts and DMs you things you might like
