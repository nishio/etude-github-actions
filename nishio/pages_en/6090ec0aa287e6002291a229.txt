 Incidentally, rabies has been eradicated in Japan more than 50 years ago, but it is still prevalent worldwide. The incubation period of the disease can last several years in some cases, so it is strictly forbidden to leave it untreated, even if it seems to be nothing to worry about.
 
 It would be too bad if I died from that, so I'm going to get the vaccine now! Sweat Sweat Sweat Sweat
 
 Lesson learned: even cute monkeys have fangs.

 In the United States, 600 to 800 bats test positive for rabies each year.

 So, he needs 5 vaccinations including today. Today's payment was 9,000 yen...mmmm. I looked at the classification written on the receipt, but even if I estimate at least 20,000 yen, I will have to pay a little more than 20,000 yen...orz
