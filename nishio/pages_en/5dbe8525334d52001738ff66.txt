The digital nation is a legal system
The [digital state] is not the technology, but the carefully crafted [legal] system around it."
	"Digital government is not about technology but carefully drafted legal system around it"

	I was wondering if this "draft" includes the nuance of unfinished.
	I am more comfortable with the model that it is a "careful" but unfinished draft, which will be improved as the situation is monitored. In Japanese translation, "carefully crafted" has a nuance of "perfectly crafted," which I think is not the case.
