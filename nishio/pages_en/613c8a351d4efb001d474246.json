2013-11-13Motivation System
	I've been so busy that I've neglected it, but I'm getting ready to do the next version of the "motivation system". It's been going on for a long, long time, which is unusual for me. I wonder if the reason I feel like coming back to it even though I've been neglecting it is because the data is accumulating while I've been neglecting it.
	I read about Lean Startup and started with the intention of putting it into practice, but it is working beneficially in a different way than I expected. The book was supposed to be about how to quickly find needs that can be monetized in a venture, a situation where time resources are limited and you have to aim for monetization, but since there are no time constraints and no aim for monetization, the premise is different.

	Often, the answer to the question, "What is the highest priority task in the motivation system?" is no longer "developing a motivation system," often because it's not a job. Because it is not a task.
	Well, in short, I'm starting to feel like I've got some high priority things to take care of, and I'm taking next weekend off in lieu of working on a holiday, so it's my fourth straight day off, so it's time to start tweaking my motivational system.
	I thought of Cookie Clicker, but the number of people using the system is monotonically increasing, so it's called a "vanity index" that doesn't help us make a decision to choose a good strategy, but it's there in the sense that it can be gamified to motivate people to do so.
