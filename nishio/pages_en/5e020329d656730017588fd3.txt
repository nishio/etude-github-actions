Putting word handles on illustrations
The reason why it is useful to [group] some of the [illustrations] in a KJ-legal sense is that making a nameplate is the act of attaching "a [handle] of words to manipulate it" for a concept.

In the same way that in the KJ method, first the spatial arrangement of sticky notes expresses relationships, and then words are created to express them after the fact, in diagrams, you first draw various things, and then [after the fact] handles are created for them.

This is the same as writing a program and then lumping parts of it into a function

Therefore, it is important to draw a diagram first, and then to post-draw a part of the diagram and make it a "whole thing".

In the past, when the KJ method was invented, the device was paper, so it was a hassle to hollow out the device after the fact.
