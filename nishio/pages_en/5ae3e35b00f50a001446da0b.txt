	Commentary on [Psycho-phenomenology
	>Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, published in 1807, describes the process by which "[consciousness]" starts from the lowest stage of "perception of objects," passes through "experience" to "[self-consciousness]," and then to the higher stage of "[reason]," or "[absolute knowledge]" that recognizes itself purely in the absolute [otherness]. It is an epoch-making work in modern philosophy.
