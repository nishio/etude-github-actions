Scroll Metaphor
Asked people who use notebooks in portrait orientation why they use it that way.
	[scroll]
		Infinite up and down
	No [jump in line of sight].
		I prefer [open vertically] because it's [written horizontally].

	Vertical writing
		Endless right to left.
		Image of scroll
			This is another "scroll."

question
	Is it better to go on endlessly vertically or endlessly in all directions?
		You want "[end of note]"?
			Could be, for example, a style of taking class notes from top to bottom along the left edge of the notebook and writing associations and small notes on the right.
			Style where the notebook has a top edge and you write downwards from there
				Clear starting point and chronological direction from there
		Is "[huge paper]" that goes on endlessly in all directions too flexible to use?
			Is the default infinite only at the bottom, or is it better to add an infinite amount of paper in either direction by explicitly supporting it only when you want to add more paper?

memo
	When I heard "[use the notebook horizontally]," I misunderstood it as an assertion that a horizontal ([landscape]) field of view is better.
		In reality, users were explaining different user values.
