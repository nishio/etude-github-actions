 I think [/villagepump/nishio.icon] wrote that the difference in the amount of information available on Google Books overseas and in Japan will show up as an unbridgeable educational level difference in the future[/villagepump/mtane0412.icon].
 　I remember writing it, but I don't know where...[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　There it is [next to Google search][/villagepump/nishio.icon].
　　No, this one? [Emerging knowledge service].

	　Ah, here it is [/villagepump/2022/05/16#62821308aff09e0000965c5b].
	　>The disparity in the amount of information when searching [Google Books] in English and in Japanese, I think it's going to affect the level of intelligence of [Japanese speakers] decades from now [nishio.icon].
  　>As for the amount of material that can be reproduced in libraries, it should be possible to search for it on the Internet! but it's avoided because the [fair use] rules are not well developed.
