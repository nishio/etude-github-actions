Chatbot without trigger
	Sequel to [Chatbots in Mattermost
	I was going to do the equivalent of this.
		[Enabling interactions with bots | Slack https://api.slack.com/bot-users]
			[Events API | Slack https://api.slack.com/events-api]
	I thought I might need OAuth, but actually I didn't.
	What I wanted to do in the first place was, "I don't want to have to put a trigger word in my head every time I talk to a bot."
	I assumed that I needed a trigger word to fly outside with Outgoing Webhook.
	But I should have simply left it blank.
		(at least in Mattermost).

	I didn't quite understand this explanation:.

		Cannot leave both the channel and trigger word designation blank
		If a trigger word is specified, the channel can be unspecified.
		Once a channel is identified, conversations within that channel can be picked up without trigger words.

therefore
	If you simply want to talk to the bot without trigger words, identify the channel
	If you simply want to execute a command with a trigger word on multiple channels, specify the trigger word.
	If you want to collect human conversations on multiple channels without trigger words, you need to hit the API
		OAuth or Personal Access Token
would that be the case?
