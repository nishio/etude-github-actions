Possible lucky guesses
	Artificial Intelligence will solve the problem." ["Artificial Intelligence will solve the problem" explains nothing.]
	[No mention of where the technical difficulties are] is considered a failure to understand the hurdles to realization.
	[I only have an image of the finished product], and it's not clear how I'm going to get there.
	Starting with the problems that many students experience, and then proposing solutions to improve them [proposals that are just brainstormed] tend to lack specificity and be similar or the same.

	>The level of this year's junior unexplored was unbelievably high, but there was a lot of "we already have this" and "how are we going to make this? and "What are you going to do with this in the first month? I have the impression that projects that are able to answer these questions at the proposal level are more likely to be accepted. I guess it's a matter of how to control the possible points of contention.

	>If there is no mention of what is technically difficult, the evaluation is likely to be lowered because it is assumed that the hurdles to realization are not understood. Also, the image of the finished product is too strong, and it is not clear what will be done during the period.
 > I'm wondering if this is probably why it's so easy for many PMs to drop it.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1519741645671272449]: what do you mean by "todo management is infinite and it's hard to cut off an area of it"? I was giving a supplementary explanation, but I don't understand that part.
	>[YoshifumiSeki https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1519742780557250560]: It's hard for me because it was three years ago... I've seen a lot of proposals to make a to-do management app, and I think most of them were "We'll make it easier to use. I've seen a lot of proposals to make a to-do management app, and I think most of them were "we'll make it easier to use," but in the end, it's the "to-do management after all" that makes it worthwhile and unique, I think. In the end, it is difficult to feel the value and uniqueness of the application.
	>[YoshifumiSeki https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1519743203611619328]: I guess there were a lot of suggestions that were too sensitive for existing business people because there are a lot of TODOs for managing assignments and homework. I wonder. I don't see that kind of thing these days, maybe it's because Study Supplement is so good..,
	>[YoshifumiSeki https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1519743750792114176]: If it were me right now, I would say that ideas in my head are not concrete, and they are inevitably similar, and that only ideas that have been tried and tested in the real world have value. I think I might take the approach that only ideas that have been tried and tested in the real world can be of value. I think that in the end, everyone ends up with TODO apps because they think only in their head.

Proposals that start with problems that many students experience and then just think of ways to improve them in their heads tend to be less concrete and more similar to each other

The reason why there are countless variants is because it is easy to create a new variant, and in such a situation, a proposal to create a new variant is not valued very highly.
