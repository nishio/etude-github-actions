 *1341924363*I created a website to learn FORTH.
 <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20120501/1335846610'>What we want to make: a site to learn core concepts of programming languages</a>, <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/ nishiohirokazu/20120619/1340115934'>sequel to part 2</a>.
 
 We have created a site that allows you to run the FORTH code interactively on your browser.

 For lack of a better explanation, type 1 in the interactive console on the left and you will see that 1 is added to the stack. If you then add 2 to the stack and then type +, you will see that the result of the addition, 3, is added to the stack. To execute this kind of step-by-step execution, switch the left tab to Debugger and turn on Debug mode. You can visualize the recursive call by reading the definition of fact (factorial) in the sample code on the left, executing 3 facts, and then doing Step Inside.
