Minecraft-like game of construction by arranging cubes
What you build is a factory, a puzzle game divided into stages, where the objective is to build the appropriate processing facilities between the resource supply unit and the delivery unit.
It can be said that the game specializes in the "conveyor belt and processing equipment puzzle" part of [Factorio].
