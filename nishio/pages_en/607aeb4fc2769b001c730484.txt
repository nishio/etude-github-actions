About the Do-It-Yourself Intellectual Production Program
I realized that there was no "self intellectual production program" as an extension of the current write-out chat system, so I asked for advice on how I could create one.
summary
　Chatbots are working on the side of humans and are less likely to be autonomous.
　　I like the feeling of a human being going to see it occasionally as it moves on its own at a greater distance.
　　Specifically, Twitter bots.
　Wise words bot as a first step in "worthwhile output."
　　Intellectual production is the creation of "information fragments that have been cut into the size of a tweet and made easy to distribute.
　[Self-intellectual production program].

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I wish I could be more clear about my own intellectual production program.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "clarification" is that "clarification"?
[nishio.icon]I know what to implement and how to implement it. Right now we don't know, so we are first creating a program that will help human intellectual production and increase intellectual production as a whole, but there is no program that will produce intellectual production without humans as an extension of this program. We need a different approach.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "program" is that "program"?
[nishio.icon]Input information by itself, without human manipulation, and output new useful knowledge that did not yet exist in the world.

We need a different approach.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this "program"?
[nishio.icon]Hmmm, there are two programs coming up, but let's talk about the more obvious former one. This program is invoked by a human and takes what the human writes as input. It then outputs a question statement. Whether or not this questionnaire is useful can be judged by whether or not it has prompted the human receiving it to notice
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "program"?
Runs 24 hours a day on the [nishio.icon] server

 How do you know about this "program"?
[nishio.icon]As for this one, when I went to study coaching techniques, I was told that coaches should be careful not to interpret their clients' statements without their permission, and I thought that computers are inherently better at that than humans, so I created it.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "human" is that "human"?
[nishio.icon]Human coaching. I have also tried human coaching and found the method itself to be very beneficial. However, it is expensive, and while a chat can return the text as it is typed, a voice coaching person may fail to catch or unintentionally ignore the expertise that the coachee has because the coachee does not have it.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]At the moment, I don't know how a program can create value without humans, so I am focusing on creating value as a set with humans. However, I would like to create a program that can create value without me before I die. I can't move toward completion without advancing my consideration of how to create that. Let's see, so to summarize, I see the value in getting an idea that will take me one step forward toward creating a program that can intellectually produce and create value without humans.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "program" located?
[nishio.icon]As for where they are, the current system is closely exchanging information on the human side, but the new system is working on its own at a greater distance. For example, they have their own Twitter account and send out information on their own, and I go to see them from time to time.

 What does this "program" look like?
[nishio.icon]So it's a form of chatbot that responds to what humans say, so it's reduced to a subordinate object to humans, and you don't see a future where it becomes an independent, autonomous program. It's like a fixed-point camera in a zoo that shows what is active in the absence of humans.
[nisbot.icon]What do you hope will happen regarding that "program"?
[nishio.icon]The program is primarily autonomous, but the resulting product should be of value to humans
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "program" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]We need to have the ability to output something that people will find value in.
[nisbot.icon] With regard to the "program", can it?
[nishio.icon]One possibility is a quote bot, the common ones simply output the original data, and you can use this as a generative model, or you can give it a larger article and it will cut out a piece from it about the size of one tweet and tweet it with the source (the latter you made once in a hackathon). In either case, "fragments that have been cut into the size of a single tweet and are easy to distribute" are generated, and the number of reactions will tell you how much value people found them.

 Where does this "program" come from?
After the [nishio.icon] hackathon, I left it alone, but I'll dig it out and see what kind of code it is.
