[https://gyazo.com/80d45ec33ca8cbb138108d71ad7eec02]
	The mental model that programmers and non-programmers can be clearly separated is a [false dichotomy].
	From an initiate programmer's point of view, arranging blocks on a browser may seem "not a real progamala," but in business, it is not the type of technology used that matters, but whether it can meet the needs of the customer.
	As the need for programmers increases, [gradations] spread to "places that were not previously considered programmers.
	The development of a programming learning highway has made it possible for non-programmers to solve business problems with programmatic things without months or years of training as programmers.
		Google Apps Script allows you to write programs in your browser
			Let people enter data in Google Forms, which goes into Google Spread Sheet, and then you can write programs for it.
		Kintone can automate various operations on data stored on the web without writing programs.
			Google Forms + Google Spread Sheet + Facebook" like functionality in a set.
			You can also write programs in JavaScript as well as Google Apps Script
	In this day and age, isn't it instructive to think that there is a boundary between programmers and non-programmers?
