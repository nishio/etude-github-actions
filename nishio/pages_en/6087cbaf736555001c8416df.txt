Individuals are free to transfer between teams
["Don't you need another manager?" We asked the Development Division, which abolished managers, about salary evaluation and transfer mechanisms | Cybozu Style https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/articles/m005359.html]

>In the Development Division, transfers between teams are now free.
>If you can get agreement from both your current team and the team you want to transfer to, that's OK. The manager will not intervene there.

>At Cybozu, we view transfers as similar to "job changes" between companies. We believe that if a worker strongly desires a transfer, the company has no right to forcefully hold him or her back.

>The ability to transfer to the right will create [a market principle] within the company.
> "We need someone to transfer because we don't have enough people!" but if their team is not attractive, it means they won't come. So, there will be a greater awareness of "let's make a better team" than when the manager was intervening.

Transferring [between departments] is [an individual's] freedom.

>"Career Web System" for voluntary transfers
>Each business uploads job ads on the intranet, and a system is in place where employees can freely apply for jobs. The applicant and the person in charge of each business conduct an interview, and if both parties' desires are met, a match is made, and the former department supervisor has no right of veto. This system encourages each employee to take on new challenges in his or her career.
