 *1465891550* Participated in Unexplored IoT Development Camp #1
 Since the Unexplored Development Camp #0 held last year by the Unexplored Foundation was well received, we held a camp focusing on the IoT theme with the help of Mr. Masashi Ueda of the IoT Study Group.
 
 This time, while listening to Mr. Ueda's lecture, I connected a sensor and an LCD to the I2C bus and wrote data read from the sensor to the LCD. Thanks to this, I was able to deepen my understanding of I2C, which I did not understand very well before. So I put it all together in a slide presentation so that I can easily review it half a year later.

 Sakura Internet, a corporate member of MISHOP, provided the alpha version of "Sakura IoT" free of charge for this camp. Shunsuke Aoki, an individual member, kindly provided konashi. This camp will be reported in the Unexplored Research Group #3.
 
 If the MISHOP can accumulate the know-how of development camps and hold more and more such camps, it will lead to "accelerating innovation centered on IT by supporting creative human resources from various perspectives and creating cross-industry networks," which is the purpose of MISHOP. The next meeting will be held in September. The next meeting is scheduled to be held around September.
