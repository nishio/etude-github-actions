Scrapbox横断検索
I want to [cross-search] Scrapbox.
	I can't put it in a public place, but I have a glimpse of what I want to search for.
	It would be nice to be able to search for other people's projects when searching for my own.

	Chrome拡張を入れた

	便利

案1:
	`https://scrapbox.io/<project_name>/search/page?q=test`
	in multiple iframes.
	How about using the [little service] mechanism?
	結果: 
		Scrapbox adds `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` to the response header so it can only be opened from within the same origin
		→ We can only achieve this with UserScript or Chrome extensions.

案2:
	Can this be achieved with UserScript?
	In the meantime, I was able to embed multiple project search result pages via JS.

		ページ名が[cross_search]の時だけ発動
		Adding "? keyword" in the URL to search by that keyword.
