 [f:id:nishiohirokazu:20111124203313p:image]
 
 The top gray square is the true transition probability, the 3x8 colored one is the true output probability, and the colored bars below it are the series of true latent and output variables.
 
 The middle row is the transition and output probabilities after learning it three times EM, and the color bars are, from the top, the true latent variable, the output variable, mixed colors according to the probability of z, the guess value of the most probable individual z alone, the most probable series guessed with Viterbi, and the true latent variable.
 
 The bottom row is after 100 training sessions. It can be observed that the series estimated by Viterbi and the series of the true latent variable now match much better.
 
 The initial values are normalized to be reasonable as probability values after random numbers between 0 and 1 are sprinkled. If the initial values are left as they are, the correspondence between the true latent variable and the hidden variable learned by HMM may be misaligned, making it difficult to see the results.
