 [kur https://twitter.com/kur/status/1024909048074792961] I've been looking at some information on design thinking in Japanese lately, and there's one about using different colors of post-its, and I'm like, "Really? I'm like, "Really? It seems to be effective, but I've never heard of such a thing before... [kur].
 [nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1024976983556468737] In my "[Engineer's Intellectual Production Technique]", I write "Color coding is a hassle, I don't separate it because the purpose is to reduce cognitive load" (p.166 [( Column) Colors of nameplates and fusen])
  When we are anxious about a task for which there is no guarantee that we will get results even if we work hard, we tend to go through heavy-handed [rituals] and say, "[It's not my fault because I worked so hard]," but that is not the right direction to go. Because there is no guarantee of results, we must rather cut costs, do a lot of [trial and error], and learn from the results.
  The reason I don't like to create "my idea of the best ritual" (although I know that people who want to follow a ritual without thinking for themselves will be happy if I do that) is that it causes [cessation of thinking] when the ritual walks by itself after all. [Rituals are] a gateway to thought-stopping, and we have to utilize them, but also destroy them at times.

  	>[taichi https://twitter.com/ryushi/status/1024894087176962048] The curse of object-oriented technology is that we tend to waste time endlessly piling up theories when the technology is only a tool for problem solving in the first place! The curse of object-oriented design is that it tends to waste a lot of time and money. It is difficult to quantify the quality of a design, so don't just sit at your desk and play with it, implement it.
  	Comments on this statement:.
   	uchan_nos But it helps to make programs more sophisticated, doesn't it? The world would be a hard place without object-oriented programming. I guess it is useful to have a moderate amount of rituals.
    nishio When "[methodology]" is born, it is born to be useful for a specific purpose. However, as it spreads, people forget about the purpose and mistakenly believe that simply following the methodology as they are told is "correct," and some people start using it blindly. I called this "[ritualization].
    uchan_nos I see. I see......................... It's the same with company rules. It's fine as long as the purpose is achieved without harm, but it becomes dangerous when the people who knew the original purpose gradually disappear and only the rituals remain.
