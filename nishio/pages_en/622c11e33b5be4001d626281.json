I shouldn't speak from experience, because it's said that speaking from experience is a type of old man.

That seems a little low resolution to me.
When is it wrong to speak from experience?
　Maybe when the experience is old.
　Despite the availability of new information, it does not seem a good idea to make decisions based solely on old experience without incorporating it into the decision making process.
　Instead of thinking, "There may be new information," we subconsciously think, "There must be no new information."
　　This seems to correlate with old age, so old age
　Ah, right, so it's all about the information that comes in.

When speaking from experience, new information is always a lower proportion of the information one has compared to old information.

People in their natural state tend to do that, so we should be aware of it and give greater weight to new information.
　I know you've heard that "[unlearn]" is the word on the street.

Young people naturally accept that there are things in the world that they do not know.
　So when you feel something is not right, you naturally think, "Isn't the cause of this discomfort due to something I don't know?" I naturally think, "This discomfort may be caused by something I don't know.
Old people, on the other hand, often forget this and feel like they "know everything.
　Once in this state, positive feedback is applied.
　This is due to the fact that even if a young person knows something that the "Mere Old Man, who thinks he knows everything" does not know, he does not try to point it out to him.
