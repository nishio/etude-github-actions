Vector output of meaning
	The meaning of a word can be expressed in vector form.
	If only humans knew what the word meant.
	People can output that meaning vector.
	But it can't.
	Because the human device is a piece of shit.
	Because man has had no "means of outputting vectors" in the course of his evolution up to this point.
	Did not have the hardware means to output vectors
	As a result, the ability to output vectors was not fostered.
