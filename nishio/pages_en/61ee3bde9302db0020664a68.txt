Make collecting human bugs a hobby.
After doing the [KJ method of funny] and consciously verbalizing that I think [human bugs] are funny, when people say "funny things" on social networking sites, I think "I'm being attacked with funny claims, I have to fight back by showing how funny they are!" Instead, I feel like, "Whoa, there's an interesting bug, let's add it to the collection! It's good for my mental health.

When there is a person who is not sure whether or not he or she can have a [productive discussion], I encourage a productive discussion, and if a productive response comes back, I am happy that we had a productive discussion, and if an unproductive response comes back, I am happy that my bug collection has increased.
