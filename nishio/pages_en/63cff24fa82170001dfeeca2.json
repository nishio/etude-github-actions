non-existent conflict
from [/villagepump/existent nonexistent type conflict].
I found a common pattern and named it[/villagepump/nishio.icon].

Case 1
	[/villagepump/ isn't that Japanese enough? #62748c677838e300007e2688]
>[Factor]: Factors
>When I use the word "factor", I recognize it as a word strongly associated with refactoring, so when it is rewritten as "factor", that link is severed and I feel uncomfortable[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
I don't associate refactoring with the >factor [/villagepump/Toshiyuki Masui.icon][/villagepump/Mijinko_SD.icon].
>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refactor
>>re- +‎ factor
>Maybe it's hard to understand when written in katakana, but the stem is "factor" and "ing" is added after it[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
>I've never seen the word "factor" used to mean anything other than element or factor [/villagepump/toshiyuki masui.icon].
>I have never seen the word refactor (in English or Japanese) [/villagepump/toshiyuki masui.icon].

Case 2
>In the TV drama [Mito Komon], "Why don't you just quickly give them an inro and have them refrain before the killing?" I am often asked something like. [/villagepump/mgn901.icon].
>No, I don't think many people ask that nowadays [/villagepump/suto3.icon].
>I'm asked when I mention Mito Koumon as a topic. [/villagepump/mgn901.icon].
> Is there a special environment around [/villagepump/mgn901.icon]?
>If "well" is ambiguous and there is just a difference of opinion, but "there are people who listen", then it is an observed fact[/villagepump/nishio.icon].

common pattern
　[https://gyazo.com/a3e3e84d386ed573961bf9155cf1745a]
　Mr. A sees that X is included in his observation range and says "X exists".
　Mr. B says "X does not exist" because his observation range does not include X
consideration
　This has nothing to do with the overall size of each [observation range] (so we should avoid using the expression "[narrower observation range]").
　　Reverse pattern of "[even those with little knowledge] can learn from those with little knowledge."
　If both parties express "X exists/not exists in my observation range" without omission, [both claims can be True].
　　but [people are often short of words].

[Bug confusing subjective and objective].
