This time, we only consider and order. Next time [Building Tachikoma with LEGO 3].

---
Next, I would like to improve the carry part with reference to [3x3 plate belly Tachikoma].
I'll make it with 4 or 5.
　[Reverse slope] has 1x2 and 2x2
　　Two of both is all that is needed.
　　https://www.brickers.jp/?mode=cate&cbid=1069349&csid=0
　The top is [Slope Curve 1 x 4 Double], but the blue one is sold out.
　　https://www.brickers.jp/?mode=cate&cbid=1067304&csid=20&page=2
　　I'd buy four 2x2s and two 1x2s.
　We don't have a lot of regular blue parts on hand either.
　　Lots of 1x4 plates only.
　　2x4, 2x3, 1x2, 1x3 plates
　　1x2-4 block
　　I wonder how many we need.
　Also need red transparent 1x1 panel
　　Do you want two, four, or a 1x2 panel?
　The 90 degree conversion for the dish on the side is not likely to be a front light.

　　1x1 block technique Pinhole?
　　Is that necessary? Is [headlight] enough?
　　Dish is 2x2
　The one that grabs, there are many if you don't ask about the color, but maybe there wasn't a blue one...
　 The person being grabbed also needs to be
　 Vertical clip and handle

　I like the fact that the root of the gatling is 1x1...
　[https://gyazo.com/c18b1870832db924d7ec73140713d1f8]
　 But mine is even, so I'll have to get creative.
　 [Technique block 1 x 1]

I like this one best for the legs.

　　Is Dish sticking a [T-pipe] in?
　　[https://gyazo.com/967049ee6b195dc1880e29a5321fc99d]
　　I use [grill], it's cool.
　　[https://gyazo.com/a86448daec585cefbc5ff396d19f3ff3]

　　　I have the grill on hand if it's black or gray.
　　Slope curves seem to be used in abundance for rounded forms.
　　[https://gyazo.com/a596eab0a40a9da5860fdcdb863b0b7f]
　　　I can't read what kind of structure...
　　　You haven't acquired a vocabulary of curved surface representation because you don't have many slope curves on hand to begin with.
　leg
　　Curves are slope curve 1x4
　　[https://gyazo.com/ee15ae21318ba56775c9a1fa38b87264]

　　　Four for now.
　　Are the tires connected with "[plate 1 x 2 - end small ball socket]"?
　　　I can get about four ball sockets out of my hand.
　　　The problem is the tire side, how it's connected.
　　　I wonder if [axis-ball] will work.
　　I'm not sure about the base of the foot side either.
　　[https://gyazo.com/e420b374e21dc6ac24045b1f2a6440fa]
　　　Where do the balls grow from?
　　　I wonder if [axis - ball] is stuck in "[technique block 1 x 2 - cross axis hole]".
　　　On top of that [slope curve 2 x 2]?
　　　I'm thinking "bracket 1 x 2 / 2 x 2 - reverse]" to convert it and then slope curve it further.
　　　I'm not even sure how it's connected to the torso.
　How the eyeballs are fixed at an angle is also a mystery.
　[https://gyazo.com/b00d7162bb59a7f1a81dd14d64ea8976]
　　Slope looks like 30 degrees, but it doesn't stick.
　　[Slope 30°- 1 x 2 x 2/3]
　　Don't tell me the white circle on the side is holding it down?
　　　No, the side eyes don't have the white circles on the sides, so that's different.
　　No way... glue...
　　　Well, it's not a lot of money since it's only a $60 part with three $20 ones attached.
　　　If I can't come up with a solution, so be it.
　　I was wondering if the white part of the eyeball is a tile or a dish without studs, but I see the bottom part of this.
　　[Round Plate Plate 2 x 2 Round Bottom]
　The base of the little eye on the side is [side stud block], not [headlight], maybe.
　[side stud block block 1 x 1 - 1 side stud]
　Gatling's part
　[https://gyazo.com/e279e211e2a02eba54d9c519e9ee536d]
　I think the root is a ball joint, but if you connect the ball to the cross axis, the rounds would be scuffed, so I'm not sure if it's a pin.
