Stop thinking of others as irrational
There is a type of [thought stopping] that thinks that other people's behavior is [irrational], and there is a type of [thought stopping] that thinks that other people's behavior is [irrational].
For example, suppose there was a bet that had a 1/3 chance of gaining 4 and a 2/3 chance of losing 1.
Person A thinks that it is reasonable to make this bet because the expected value is positive.
And interprets person B, who does not place bets, as being irrational.
This interpretation brings no useful development. It is just a thought process.

There could be a discrepancy in perception of "a bet that has a 1/3 chance of gaining 4 and a 2/3 chance of losing 1."
Suppose, for example, Mr. B values his self-perception that he has never failed at -2. In that case, he would be better off not making this bet, since -2 would be incurred upon failure.
In other words, this is a phenomenon in which different people have different values, and therefore, even if each person makes a rational decision, the solutions they come up with are different.

The same can be said for the [observation range].
When a red person with a narrower range of observation tries to head for the nearest minima, a person with a wider range of observation may think that it is irrational, even though it would be better to cross the mountain. However, this is also due to the difference in the range of observation, and it is erroneous to attribute this to the individual "the red person is irrational.

If people in blue are not aware of the possibility that their range of observation is also limited, then they are probably [relativizing] insufficient.
