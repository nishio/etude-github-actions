  I said, "Suggest a name for the chatbot that asks questions and prompts thought," and it chose a name that sounded like Socrates (Socrates).

  Let's hear it in Japanese.

　　Can you name one for Japanese speakers?
　　[https://gyazo.com/86def19fb9b4741c4b7753460d2edddd]
　　Not a great candidate, but you've properly understood the instruction "for Japanese speakers".
　　The name now is Keichobot, which comes from the word "listening."
　　[https://gyazo.com/4b9ce54d3010ffe72d17b8ffea0a7222]
　　You say, "Let's see..."
　　But it properly reads, "I guess it's better to use the trait of listening," which is really great.
　　Randomness increases as temperature is raised, good when you want to choose from a lot of candidates.

　　　I like the "find it" bot.
　　　　I pronounce the current "leaning-botto" like "keichobotto" myself, and maybe I subconsciously preferred being a 3-mora.
　　　The name "~Lab" is not exactly what I had in mind this time, but it would be an interesting name for another version of the system that accumulates information and links it to past conversations.
　　　　Or "Kizuki Labs."
　Oh, hey, we're talking about writing code without explaining the other modes.
　　What about the type of task that has instruction and input?
　　I wonder if they are simply bonding.

　　That's what it looks like.

　　Choose an appropriate key phrase and ask questions that dig into it.
　　[https://gyazo.com/336666b3aef107350c54ce28e04ad67a]
　　The question is correctly made!
　　　You don't have to create a solution...

　　Hmmm, I was asking well earlier... maybe it's just a coincidence...
　　[https://gyazo.com/5c608677bfa32b88e9d63d2e60edbb7d]

　　Hmmm. I can't get them to understand the instruction to make a question text in Japanese. If I translate the questions separately, I end up with something like, "It's good to have a clear head," or "What do you mean by 'clear head'?" I can't achieve the purpose of picking up key phrases from the other person's statement and asking in-depth questions...
