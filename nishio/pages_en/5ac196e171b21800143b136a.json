Fairness + Groupware
 [It occurred to me that the principles related to [information sharing] and [open discussion], which are called "[fair and honest]" in the Cybozu philosophy, may be causing synergy with the high [groupware] utilization rate.
 There is an idea in the world that people should be equal, and we call it "[equality]" in good words and "[peer pressure]" in bad words.
 And under this "it should be equal" philosophy, the act of "creating a new system to solve someone's dissatisfaction" is negatively evaluated as "only that person benefits and it is unfair, it is not equal".
 Cybozu, which has 100 different personnel systems for 100 people, does not have this "should be equal" philosophy.
  On the contrary, the idea that "everyone is different.
 So, under that premise, what kind of "[definition of good]" do we have instead?
 When creating a new system, the timing of verbalizing a need that has not been verbalized before, the assumed user is just you or a few people, but in the process of examining it, information is shared according to the principles of "fairness" and "publicly and obviously saying out loud that it is right," and when people see it, they say "I wanted it, too. It snowballs and expands.
 On the other hand, in an environment where one has to say, "This system will make this many people happy," when introducing a new system, it is difficult to create a climate that encourages more and more suggestions from the bottom.
  This is because high costs are being imposed on the proponent.
  The cost of "put up with it or quit" and "propose and change the system" is lower in the latter case, which is why the proposal happens.
  	If not, it won't happen.
   [Disengagement, statement, allegiance].
 And then I was writing and the articles started flowing.
  [Work style reform that enables "100 people, 100 different ways" comes from understanding and empathy | Mirai Works https://mirai-works.co.jp/interview/m002/]
  > This is the starting point of Cybozu's work style reform. We continue to change our internal systems based on the idea that "this system is designed for person A" and "this part of the system will be changed so that person B's wishes can be realized.
  Some companies in the world have a culture that sees this as "inequality," and in such places, the definition of "good" needs to change first.
  but, well, it would be difficult.
  If we want to do a personnel system that looks at each individual, the burden will be much greater than it is now, so we will either need to reduce the number of employees or increase the number of personnel.
