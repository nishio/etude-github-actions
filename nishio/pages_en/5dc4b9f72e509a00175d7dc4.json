avoid the basics
　The basics are an appropriate first step for many people.
　Since it is feasible for "many people," it could also be interpreted as "anyone can do it."
　Some sort of pride thing makes them feel that it's lame to do something that anyone else can do.
　As a result of avoiding tacky things, the first step becomes too heavy and you can't move on.

Example
　Studying for exams, avoiding simple repetitive training and working only on difficult problems that are cool to solve.
　In learning entrepreneurial skills, avoid the naive "product sales model" and try to do the more difficult model.
