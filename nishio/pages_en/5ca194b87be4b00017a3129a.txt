	Areas where less than 10% of the pages have no links and less than 10% of the links contain links other than noun-adjective symbols.
		masui, shokai, daiiz are densely populated
	On the other hand, as for the "percentage of links containing other than noun-adjective symbols," there are more projects around 30%.

[Example of a link containing something other than a noun, adjective, or symbol (must appear at least twice): https://gist.github.com/nishio/913366753ae05dfb991c0fadaf6576fc]
	Titles of books and presentation materials are available.
	For those using [blog-like usage], the title of the page is often a sentence, and so is the link to the page.
	Cases involving numerical values (`Provincial Law 41`, etc.)

From the above, I added the condition "not the title of the page".
