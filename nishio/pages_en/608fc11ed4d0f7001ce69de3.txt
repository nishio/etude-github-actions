Sum of reciprocals of values less than 10 with an error of less than 1
code: Sum of reciprocals of values less than 10 with an error of less than 1
 (2, 4, 7, 9) 1.0040
 (2, 5, 6, 7) 1.0095
 (2, 5, 6, 8) 0.9917
 (3, 4, 6, 7, 9) 1.0040
 (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 0.9956

code:python
 from itertools import combinations
 for n in range(4, 10):
     for xs in combinations(range(2, 10), n):
         s = sum(1 / x for x in xs)
         if abs(s - 1) < 0.01:
             print(xs, "%.4f" % s)

If we broaden the scope, we get examples like 2,3,7,42
ã€€[$ 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/42 = 21/42 + 14/42 + 6/42 + 1/42 = 42/42]
Even if you use the favorable number module to exclude the ones that are exactly 1, you still get the obvious ones like 2,3,7,43, which are not interesting.

[programmatically explore].
