It's all about shifting perspectives.
 Tend to get caught up in the metaphor of sitting and working
 It is a constraint of the physical world that intellectual production tends to be tied to fixed devices such as desks and whiteboards
 Rent is expensive for larger rooms.
 In VR space, an unlimited number of whiteboards and desks can be used in an unlimited number of large spaces
  No need to clean up.
 Software is needed to support intellectual production under these circumstances
