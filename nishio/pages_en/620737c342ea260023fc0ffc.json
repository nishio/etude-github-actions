Never complain.

Complaining always discredits. It is better to be an example of independence against the passions of others than to be the object of their mercy. This is because complaining paves the way for the listener to what we are complaining about, and publicizing one insult forms an excuse for another. Also, asking for assistance or advice only earns indifference or contempt. It is more polite to praise one person's favor and make others feel compelled to follow suit. To speak of favor to one who is absent is to demand a similar favor from one who is present, and thus to sell credit to one to the other. A shrewd man, therefore, never publishes his failures and shortcomings to the world, but only those tokens of consideration which help to keep friendship alive and enmity silent.
