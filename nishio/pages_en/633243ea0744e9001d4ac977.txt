Companies that don't have a problem with maternity leave taken immediately after employment
[https://kumagi.hatenablog.com/entry/ikukyu I got a new job at Google and suddenly got 3 months maternity leave - Software Transactional Memo]
>[https://twitter.com/twk/status/1098375265468657664 @twk]: I'm surprised at [maternity leave] out of the blue, but at the job interview when I was changing jobs, I was told, "I'm expecting a baby a month after joining the company," and "If the baby is born, you can take 3 months off, so please still come." This is truly a different dimension, as the exchange should have been "I'm going to have a baby in a month.

>I said, "I'm about to have a baby, so I think I'll take my new job after I get maternity leave at NTT.
>G "If you don't have a baby after you come to us, you can't use our benefits, so hurry up and come."
>I'm like, "Seriously?"
>I had to move to the new company without having to take off NTT's paid time off because there was an exchange of "I'll take off NTT's paid time off.

I remember the story of the "please join us as soon as possible before the baby is born" and I feel like I can only win if I have a very fat company.
