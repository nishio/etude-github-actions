Polarity determination by radical + CNN + LSTM
[Document Classification by CNN+LSTM using Kanji radicals as features | Artificial Intelligence R&D Engineers Group - Nextremer Inc. https://www.nextremer.com/blog/5636/]
Polarity Segmentation using [CNN] + [LSTM] with [radical] as a feature

Use [CHISE / Kanji Structure Information Database] to obtain radical information.

It would be good to combine with [Kanji Dividend Chart by Grade].
