 *1238830586* "Exponential" or "Exponential"?
 >>
 id:userjapan As was discussed in Masuda a while ago, the expression "exponentially growing" is still a bit tricky. I think "exponentially" is a good way to describe it, though.
 <<
 I remembered that there was an opinion that the word "exponential" is not a recent phenomenon. I thought, "This is not the first time that the word "exponential" has been translated as "exponential", and there are many textbooks and papers that use such a term," so I checked.
 
 For now, let's look at the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/489471163X?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399& creativeASIN=489471163X">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> to look at the index.

 Exponential increase, 24
 <<
 
 Mm. Just as I remember it.
 
 In addition, I will also search for the extent to which it is used in papers.
 - 473 items: <a href='http://ci.nii.ac.jp/search?q=%22%E6%8C%87%E6%95%B0%E9%96%A2%E6%95%B0%E7%9A%84%22&range=0&count=20&sortorder=1'>CiNii Search - "exponential"</a>.
 - 214 items: <a href='http://ci.nii.ac.jp/search?q=%22%E6%8C%87%E6%95%B0%E7%9A%84%22&range=0&count=20&sortorder=1'>CiNii Search - "exponential"</a>
 
 I don't know what kind of argument was being made in the key Masuda (Hatena Anonymous Diary), but if he was arguing that "the use of 'exponential increase' is wrong," I thought he was being too narrow-minded.

 Whole tomatoes are canned tomato juice pulp.

 >The site was called "Furusato Tax Payment ONLINE SHOP" and stated that it was directly operated by the non-existent "General Affairs Agency" and that "Furusato Tax Payment is now available online. If you click on a part of the screen, the words "It was an April Fools' Day project. Sorry" appears.

 I thought it was an elementary school book report, but it's high school. I can't believe that a high school student would be offended just for reading a story in which a person is killed. I can't believe that a high school student would be reported to the prefectural police cybercrime support office just for creating a joke website that clearly states that it is April Fool's Day and has no function to cheat people out of their money.
 
 
 If they are raised in a sterile room where even weak poisons are thoroughly eliminated, when they are exposed to a toxin that cannot be eliminated, they are likely to become immune and die.

 <body>That's true. <br>I could understand saying "it's not OK, it's not OK" in elementary and junior high school, but recently I've been more afraid of this kind of adult complacency. </body><br><br>I am afraid of this kind of self-satisfaction of adults these days.
