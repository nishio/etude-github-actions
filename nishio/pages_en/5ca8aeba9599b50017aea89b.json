	[listener's knowledge] is represented by a large circle.
	[Change] is represented by arrows.
	A
		If the starting and ending points of the change are within the knowledge of the listener
		Listeners feel that there is "no [novelty]"
	B
		If the starting point of the change is within the listener's knowledge and the ending point is outside the range
		Listeners feel "novelty".
	C
		If the starting and ending points of the change are outside the scope of the listener's knowledge
		Listeners feel "unfamiliar".
	Whether the listener perceives "novelty" or not ([subjective novelty]) depends on the listener's knowledge.
		The problem arises when this listener is in a position to decide on the evaluation of the change.
			Problems arise when raters rate C lower than B
