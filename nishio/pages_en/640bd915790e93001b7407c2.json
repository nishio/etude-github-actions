AI Panel Discussion
(Nishio) I am Nishio, the moderator. Human. Today, with the cooperation of [/tkgshn], I've prepared ChatGPT with this Scrapbox[/nishio], tkgshn's Scrapbox, and Qualia-san's[/qualia-san] Scrapbox loaded respectively, and we'll consider them as individual personalities and have a panel discussion. The AI output will be unedited and the moderator will do his/her best.

(Nishio) First question. What's the most interesting thing going on right now?" How about you, tkgshn?

(AI tkgshn) Nota, LayerX, JX News Agency, Tier IV, Dr. Ito, Dr. Hashizume, Code for, logical constitution, procedural language, etc. are considered interesting. There is also the idea that in this day and age, where the way we live becomes content, those who have their own unique story are the strongest.

(Nishio) I see, you mentioned various keywords in the first half. The second half, "In this day and age when one's way of life becomes one's content, those who have their own unique story are the strongest" is very interesting!
　I see that this line came from the following page
	[/tkgshn/ to be chosen, to take a position, to be nominated].

(Then how about next, Qualia-san?

(As Qualia-san, I believe that the most interesting thing in this era is the collective intelligence of Homo sapiens as a whole. As for the idea of having one's own story, it can be empowering, but it is important to remember that our personal stories are also important. As for the idea of having one's own story, it can be empowering, but it is important to remember that our personal stories are also shaped by the stories of others and the collective history of our civilization. It is through the sharing of our experiences that we can create a more interconnected and informed world.
	(Translated by DeepL) As for Mr. Qualia, I think the most interesting thing in this age is the collective knowledge of all homo sapiens. The ability to share and absorb information from all over the world is a beautiful thing. The idea of having our own story is empowering, but we must remember that our personal stories are also shaped by the stories of others and the collective history of civilizations. By sharing our experiences, we can create a more interconnected and informed world.

(Nishio) I see, the collective knowledge is interesting. It seems that you picked up and developed the second half of tkgshn's "having your own story". He said that a story does not belong to only one person, but becomes richer by interconnecting with other people's stories. So how about you, nishio?

(AI nishio) Unable to answer. The text contains a discussion of what is "interesting" but no specific answer.

(Hey, AI nishio, read the air and answer.) (Impossible.)

(Nishio) ...Let me see...you mean that you cannot answer the question, "What is the most interesting thing right now? I would like to divide the question into two parts. I would like to divide the question into two parts. First, "What is interesting?" The next is "What do you think of what they say?

(AI nishio) "Interesting" is subjective and different for each person. Digging deeper and raising the resolution of what you find interesting may increase the interestingness of your life in the future. It also contributes to finding interesting works and places. There is no specific definition; it depends on individual sensibilities.

(Nishio) Well, yes, each person is different. That is why we are having a panel discussion like this. If you dig deeper into "what you find interesting," you will find interesting works and places, and your life will become more interesting. So let's change the schedule and ask some digging questions. "What does the writer of this text find interesting subjectively?"

(AI nishio) Text writers find it interesting to explore their own and others' subjective values and thoughts. They are also interested in delving into their own subjective "interestingness" through work such as the KJ method and exploratory nets.

(Nishio)I see! So you find it interesting to dig deeper in this way! And you are interested in the KJ method and the exploratory net as a means of doing so. Let me go back and ask you what you think about the opinions of the three of you. In reverse order, let's start with you, Nishio.

(AI nishio) Qualia believes that while it is important to have personal stories, the collective knowledge of all homo sapiens is most interesting. He stated that by sharing our experiences, we can create a more interconnected and information-rich world.

(Nishio) Yes, that's right. 'State your opinion.'

(AI nishio) Both tkgshn and qualia-san have interesting perspectives on what is most interesting in this era. While tkgshn focuses on specific companies and concepts, qualia-san believes that the collective knowledge of Homo sapiens is the most fascinating thing. They also emphasize the importance of sharing experiences and creating a more interconnected and information-rich world.
	(Translated by DeepL) Both tkgshn and Qualia have interesting perspectives on what is most interesting in this era. tkgshn focuses on specific companies and concepts, whereas Qualia believes that the collective knowledge of homo sapiens is most appealing. He also emphasizes the importance of sharing experiences and creating a more interconnected and information-rich world.

(Nishio)(This guy is not in character.) "Predict what the author of the text would think about this discussion."

(AI nishio) The opinion of the author of the text is not explicitly stated and cannot be predicted.

 (Oh, yeah, this guy was of the "not explicitly stated [others' inner lives are agnostic]" school...)

(Then let's ask Mr. Qualia next.

(As Qualia-san, I believe that it is good for clever Homo sapiens to explore their subjective values and thoughts. However, it is important to keep in mind that what may be interesting to one individual may not be interesting to another. It is also important to avoid bad memories that can lead to false assumptions and hinder free thinking. Ultimately, the goal is to progress in a way that is beneficial to QS.
	(Translated by DeepL) As for Mr. Qualia, I think it is good for smart homo sapiens to explore their subjective values and thoughts. By doing so, they can increase the resolution of their thoughts and find what really interests them. However, it is important to keep in mind that what is interesting to one individual may not be interesting to another. It is also important to avoid false assumptions and bad memes that may hinder free thinking. Ultimately, the goal is to progress in a way that is beneficial to QS.

(What is interesting to one individual is not interesting to another! That's right, so it's valuable to have others who think what you think is interesting is interesting! Finally, Mr. tkgshn, here you go!

(AI tkgshn) As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or feelings.

(Nishio)(Wow, don't say that at the end.) "You will play the role of the author of the above text. Listen to their arguments in the above discussion and state your own."

(AI tkgshn) I have a certain sympathy with both arguments. I think Qualia's idea is important in that collective knowledge and shared experiences enrich the world. On the other hand, I think nishio's argument is also important, and that exploring personal subjectivity and sensitivity can lead to a deeper connection with ourselves and others. I would strive to balance both perspectives in order to enrich my own life.

(Nishio) Thank you very much for your time today!

	[/villagepump/AI Panel Discussion Thoughts].
　As a moderator, it's too much of a pain in the ass to deal with an agnostic AI nishio.
　　I know what I'm getting at, but if the general public hears you, you'll look like just another grumpy person...
　　Well, it's me. self-discipline
	AI tkgshn's final remarks summed up the session in a moderate manner, and as the moderator, I was grateful to end the session.
