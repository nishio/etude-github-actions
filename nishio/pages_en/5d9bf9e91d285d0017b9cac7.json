		[Gyazo https://gyazo.com/api?lang=ja] There is a Gem
		[masui/Book2Scrapbox: a device for reading self-prepared books in Scrapbox https://github.com/masui/Book2Scrapbox]
	Upload to Gyazo Pro via script after disassembling into images
	Gyazo Pro uses Google Cloud Platform's CLOUD VISION API for [OCR].
	It takes time, so we get OCR data after a while.

Readings from https://github.com/masui/Book2Scrapbox
	Scanning results from ScanSnap are retrieved in pdfimages
		Related [PDF to PNG].
		If it's a cut-and-scan PDF, that's OK.
		PDFs of slides, etc. are not acceptable.
	Locally, folders are cut and stored with MD5 hash.
	Sync it to AWS.
		[AWS Command Line Interface (CLI: an integrated tool to manage AWS services)| AWS https://aws.amazon.com/jp/cli/] must be installed
		[Installing the AWS CLI - AWS Command Line Interface https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html]
			That's very kindly written.
		[AWS CLI Configuration - AWS Command Line Interface https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html]
		[aws s3 sync]
			Deletion on hand does not delete anything on S3.
	Sync to AWS is not really required.
		Because I'm sending the contents of the FILE to gyazo.
	https://github.com/nishio/Book2Scrapbox
 	Slides cannot be converted to images by pdfimeges.
 		$ pdftocairo -r 200 -f 0 -jpeg <pdf> pages
 			see [PDF to PNG conversion].
		Multiple PDFs are now combined into a single JSON
		pdfstojson.rb calls makejson.rb
			I looked into how to do it in Python, but I was able to achieve it by using makejson.rb as a child process.
		Download and add the OCR results from Gyazo a while after the JSON is ready.
