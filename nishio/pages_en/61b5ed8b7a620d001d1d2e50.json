flow to the low and get crowded
[https://gyazo.com/561af08cc26553cca9b9aecb13f762d5]
Trying to pass through a break in the [obstacle](oka) [congestion].
　[Competition] is going to be fierce.
　[Bottleneck]
　　If this place collapses, everything that passes through it will be wiped out.
　[flows low].

I sometimes use [avoiding competition] with a negative nuance of [running away], but I wonder if [avoiding difficulties] and taking a position that will cause competition is [running away] as well.
　In addition, [nishio.icon] thinks that the assumption that "escape is negative" is itself wrong.
