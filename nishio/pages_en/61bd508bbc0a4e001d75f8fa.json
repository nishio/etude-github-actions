　　This is verified by whether the [phenomenon] that occurs as a result of the experiment is consistent with the expectation.

　The "predictions" are being matched against the "experimental results."
　　Forecasts are largely nonverbal, although the main part may be described linguistically
　　　That's why we have "[Unexpected Findings]."
　　　Example: I was mixing a chemical and it turned out to be a very bright color, even though I didn't intend it to be that way.
　　　　They couldn't have verbalized before the experiment that "the color doesn't change as a result of the experiment."
　　The result of the match may be an exact match, an exact mismatch, or a partial match.
　　　Encourages segmentation of the world in the case of partial
　　　This is the same principle as direct matching of symbols
				[There are three patterns in the results of direct matching.]
