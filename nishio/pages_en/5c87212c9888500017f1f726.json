[Jay Barney] is well known for [resource base view]. see [Bernie controversy].

To put it very crudely, the [objective] comes first, and then [causal reasoning] is based on what can be done to achieve it, while the opposite concept, effectuation, is based on [means] first.
If the [predictability] of the future is low, the success rate will be low even if we [calculate backwards] from the objective with cohesion, then it would be better to do more and more what we can do now.
This philosophy has a high affinity with the "resource-based view," which focuses on "what [resources] I have at the moment.

 We don't predict the future; we create it through our actions."
