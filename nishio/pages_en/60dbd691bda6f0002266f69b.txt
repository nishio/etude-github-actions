CC-BYing with Death
I haven't officially made up my mind yet, but I'm thinking maybe I should make it something like "When I die, all my works placed there shall be CC-BY" to avoid the bug in copyright law that locks you up for decades without anyone being able to authorize your use.

If I make the Scrapbox a joint editing system, it becomes a [joint work] under the law and I can't change the license at my discretion.

But is that a hassle when I try to use what I wrote here in my own work?
