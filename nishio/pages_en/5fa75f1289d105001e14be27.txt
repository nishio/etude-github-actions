Notice the small constants.
When there is a small constant in a problem, that small constant is often necessary for the problem to be solvable

Example
　Two types of coins [abc099_c].
　Tri-color ball
　Select one from each of the four sets [half whole enumeration].

relevance
	[small constraint problem].
		Constants are not always constraints.
