I'm getting about 6 errors like this on the server over time.

code:py
 def initialize(mode, env):
     for x in plugins:
         if mode == x.MODE:
             env.log.append([0, x.START_QUESTION])
             env.state = x.START
             return
     else:
         raise ValueError(f"unknown mode {mode}")

Ah, that's because you've made it so that the mode specification is received in the URL, so you get an error when there's garbage at the end of the URL.

I tried to make a decision with startswith instead of equal, and also to go into normal mode if I still couldn't make a decision.
