　Thoughts.
　　If the remaining gcd after removing one is 1, then it's 1 no matter what.
　　　Because the gcd can never be greater than the argument.
　　In other words, "Find the maximum value of gcd with one removed."
　　This is [product except one].
　　[Cumulative product from left to right] is OK.
　Official Explanation
　　Same policy
　　He's using 0 as a sentry.
　　[$ \gcd(0, X) = \gcd(X, 0) = X ]
		Python standard gcd also behaves this way
