I've accepted a speaking engagement at my alma mater, and I'd like to talk about it.
summary
　I felt bewildered about a project with a long-overdue deadline.
　This is the anxiety of being in a fog where you can't see what's ahead.
　When you talk to the chatbot about your state of confusion, it becomes text, and by looking at it, you can deepen your understanding of the current situation.
　Once you realize that you are in a fog, you can talk to the chatbot about what you need to do next to get out of it

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon]I've accepted a speaking engagement at my alma mater, and I'd like to talk about it.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "alma mater" is that?
[nishio.icon]NGKW Alma Mater
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "talk" is that "talk"?
The [nishio.icon]lecture itself is still a long way off, but I'd like to take a step forward by speaking anyway, because I'd be slammed if the deadline approaches without doing anything, and above all, doing nothing is also a waste of time due to the [zygarnik effect].
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "waste" is that "waste"?
[nishio.icon]When I have something on my mind, I remember it over and over, time and concentration are taken up by it, but I don't get anything out of it because I'm not doing anything.
[nisbot.icon]What "how many degrees" is that "how many degrees"?
[nishio.icon]When you get into a state where you are curious and remember, you stay in the same state unless you do something to get out of it, so "Oh, I have to do something" is repeated.
[nisbot.icon]What is that "same state as long as"?
[nishio.icon]NGKW Same status as far as
[nisbot.icon]What "state" is that "state"?
[nishio.icon]I want to move forward with the project, but I'm not in a position to verbalize a concrete way to proceed. So there's talk of just making a plan to alleviate that.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about that "condition"?
[nishio.icon]Staying in this state is a loss and I want to get out of it.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "state"?
[nishio.icon]There is a blur in my head. Ah, well, "write it down anyway" is one of the beneficial options to change the state.
[nisbot.icon]How do you know its "condition"?
[nishio.icon]I can tell by the bewildered mood.
[nisbot.icon]
 > There is a blur in my head. Ah, well, "write it down anyway" is one useful option to change the state.
 What does this "state" look like?
[nishio.icon]Fog, maybe. I think they are anxious because they can't see what's ahead.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "fog" is that?
[nishio.icon] that prevents us from seeing what lies ahead. The opposite state of affairs is a scene where it's clear and crisp, you can see the path you need to take, and you can even see what's ahead of you on the road.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that "state"?
[nishio.icon]Inside the mind. After all, it is I myself who create that state.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "myself" is that "myself"?
[nishio.icon]People who procrastinate and get impatient when the deadline approaches.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of "giggle" is that "giggle"?
[nishio.icon]Procrastinate without acting.
[nisbot.icon]What is its "destination"?
[nishio.icon]I'll do it later, not now, and leave it undecided as to when exactly I will do it. Then the next time you remember, the state of the situation hasn't changed, so you procrastinate in the same way.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]I hope that by talking to a chatbot about a task that has a vague foggy feeling that makes you want to procrastinate, you can clear the fog, see the path forward, and get out of your dithering state.
[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen regarding that "condition"?
[nishio.icon]Hopefully the fog will lift.
[nisbot.icon]What needs to happen to the "state" for that to happen?
[nishio.icon]I think it would be good if the state of being bewildered could be put into text through chat, etc., so that we could see it, understand it better, and come up with more concrete tasks.
[nisbot.icon] With respect to "state", can it?
[nishio.icon]So this chat helped me realize that I am in a fog, but it is not a concrete task to proceed with the lecture project. It would be good to discuss next time "what exactly we are going to do about this project".

 Where does this "state" come from?
