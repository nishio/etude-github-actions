 *1319071682* Childhood works
 A work from around the age of 4. What the hell is this? What did you want to express...

 I can see Earth and Saturn, but what's with the wavy lines?

 And it's even more abstract. w

 I'd like to know when and in what context they were written, but I don't think I'll ever know now, so I think people who keep their children's work now should record that kind of information. I thought I would do that when I have children.
 
 *1319117086*Tried the KJ method.
 I did KJ method type A (or something like that) and then mind-mapped (or something like that). I tried to buy information cards, but my wife said, "Sticky notes are better, they are less bulky and stick to the paper. They are much smaller than the size of a business card.

 I lined them up in a croquis for mind mapping.

 I would have circled the cards as they were, but space is limited, and I thought the cards themselves were missing something necessary when I looked at them again from a macro perspective, so I redrew them in a mind-mapping style.

 In the mind map method, which is a top-down process starting from the center, instead of a clear center, the ability to draw connections between the ends strongly depends on the creator's ability to be inspired. On the other hand, in the KJ method, which summarizes from the bottom up, the connections at the ends are clear, but whether or not the center is clearly organized strongly depends on the creator's ability to organize information. So both have their advantages and disadvantages.
 
 In this case, I used books as a source of information, so the information was originally structured to some extent. Next time, let's try to summarize fragmented and unorganized information using the KJ method.
