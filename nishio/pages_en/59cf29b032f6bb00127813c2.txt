Hilbert's finite position
	Hilbert's Second Problem, 1900.
 How can we guarantee the existence of transfinite objects such as the real numbers that mathematics is dealing with?
 Hilbert thought it would be sufficient to first formally express the properties of transfinite objects as axioms, and then prove the consistency of the formal system obtained in this way.
 In 1931, GÃ¶del proved the Incompleteness Theorem, which showed that it is not possible to prove consistency within the "finite standpoint" that Hilbert had originally conceived.
 Gentzen succeeded in proving the consistency of natural number theory in 1936 by slightly relaxing Hilbert's "finite position" and allowing transfinite induction up to a certain ordered number.
 Gaisi Takeuchi developed a method for describing larger ordered numbers and extended Gentzen's method to provide a proof of the consistency of subsystems of real number theory.
