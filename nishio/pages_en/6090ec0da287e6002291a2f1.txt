 Toma (male, 3 months) joined our family about 4 weeks ago. We don't know his birthday or parentage as we are taking in a shelter stray cat from a foster home.
 
 I was talking with my wife today, and it seems that it is difficult to find information on how to start keeping cats. I thought it might be written in cat blogs, but for cat blog authors who have already had cats for a long time, it seems to be "something that happened a long time ago" or "something they usually do as a matter of course, so they don't dare to write about it in their blogs".
 
 So I plan to write several articles in the future from the perspective of a new owner.
