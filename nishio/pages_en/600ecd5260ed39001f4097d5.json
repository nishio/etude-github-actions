Dyson Sphere Program Day3
[Dyson Sphere Program]

Power plant built. An independent plant that converts crude oil from oil wells into hydrogen and burns it all up. Since it does not require the exchange of materials, it can be built far away from the home base.

A good transmission facility can send the power from that distant power plant in one shot.

Power is now adequate.

Since the time of the photo, the hydrogen tanks have been changed to a four-tiered stack. As long as there is enough electricity available, hydrogen will gradually accumulate because it burns at a slower rate. Next, when power generation capacity becomes insufficient, thermal power plants are added, and when fuel stocks dwindle, it will eventually become impossible to maintain that amount of power generation, so new oil wells are drilled.

The Dyson sphere is to be built in order to reach the second stage, but if this is the case, I thought that we should first utilize all the energy on the earth as a flow of civilization evolution, and that it would be strange to proceed to the Dyson sphere without utilizing the infinite oil wells that are available on the earth.

But it would be a pain to install this on every oil well on the planet.
Maybe the next step is power generation using Jupiter's hydrogen instead of oil wells, or maybe fusion power. Both have been studied.
