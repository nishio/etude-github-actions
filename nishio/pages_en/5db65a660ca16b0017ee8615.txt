Change of Vision
In the process of changing its [vision] from "[the world's No. 1 in groupware]" to "[a society overflowing with teamwork]," [Cybozu] may have changed its focus from [groupware] (software, [artifact]) alone to [teamwork] (a system that works while multiple people [interact] with the groupware productivity]) rather than [groupware] (software, [artifact]) alone.

(The interaction that was recently discussed in the lab was connected in my mind with the teamwork.)
