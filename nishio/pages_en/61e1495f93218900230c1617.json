　　Because in the B1 to B2 arrow, B1 is not the only input.
　　Rather, new words are coming "from A" due to B1's stimulus, I think the subject is A.

　　This is [CIRCUMLOCUTION] expressed in terms of [experiential process and the creation of meaning
 　The clarification of meaning by [RELEVANCE] is expressed in this diagram by cutting it out in sets, but I feel that this is "generally not limited to that", I can't think of a better way to express it.
