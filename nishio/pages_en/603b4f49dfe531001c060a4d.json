My wife asked me if the Tachikoma was finished, so I summarized the current situation

　[1×4 tile leg Tachikoma] is made except for Carrie.
　　I've converted my hands to three fingers to try it out, but I think it's too subtle.
　　Carrie is planning to use a different shape because the parts [Windscreen 2 x 4 x 3 Frame] that the original uses are hard to find
　　　I'm thinking of enlarging my [3x3 plate belly Tachikoma] carry-on a notch.
　[1x4 curved slope leg Tachikoma] is divided into head, legs and carry
　　The challenge is how to close the bottom of the carriage.

I heard that eyeballs are cuter when they stick out.
In the original, they pop out about 40%.
	With a round top, it would pop out 60%, and with a round bottom, the curvature would be too flat, it's a tough call.

Ah, well, there's always the option of a little wanderlust.
