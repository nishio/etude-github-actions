Whoever notices does it.
>The burden of "whoever notices will do it" type chores tends to be concentrated on a specific individual, so I asked a different junior staff member to do it with me each time, or I told a junior staff member whom I had taught how to do it before to "teach another junior staff member". (Note that "It's faster to do it myself" is easy to accumulate stress.
> "Guess by the air" like "everyone else do it too" doesn't work, so it's important to properly verbalize that you want help, and others often think "I'd rather avoid it if I can but it's better to do it", so I've never had a bad look when I gently ask them to help me. It's important to [motivate others] as well as myself.
