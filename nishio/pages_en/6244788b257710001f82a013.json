Organizations are places to combine expertise
from [the more advanced knowledge becomes, the more specialized it becomes and the less useful it becomes on its own].
>An organization is a place where [expertise] is organically linked and even [combined]. An organization is any place where people [work together] toward a goal, such as a company, government agency, or non-profit organization. Thus, a society in which knowledge is central is necessarily a society of organizations. There is de-organization, but not de-organization.
