Deleted Japanese directory in git.
	I turned it off locally, but I was jittery because I couldn't staging it without it being staged.
 $ git checkout .
  First, I put it back in a clean state.
 $ git rm -r "Japanese file name"
		After making a selection using zsh's choice completion, the directory name is enclosed in quotation marks
 Now it's safely erased.
