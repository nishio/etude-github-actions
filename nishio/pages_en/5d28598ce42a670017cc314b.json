Assigning contextual information
	You can take a screencap of the screen you are looking at and paste it on a sticky note.
　Can store contextual information such as "what was I looking at when I wrote this sticky note?"
　Windows Ink has a standard feature that allows you to scrub the image you are looking at and write on it
　I want to paste an image in the clipboard.
　It's odd that the only contextual information stored is images.
　　For example, if it is a web page, its URL or title is the context
　　Reading a physical book, watching TV, having a conversation in a CCSE booth, etc. are also contexts
　For example, if you are reading an e-book and you highlight a page, ideally it should go into the system accompanied by information such as "what page of the book, what chapter/section".
　Ideally, conversations at the CCSE booth should be automatically transcribed, inscribed on stickies, and imported, and it should be possible to add information to these stickies after the fact, saying "This range of stickies is from the CCSE booth.
