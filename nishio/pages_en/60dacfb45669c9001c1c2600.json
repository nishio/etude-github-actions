✅Smooth scaling and translating in the DOM
I want to implement natively instead of implementing in JS that the coordinates of each element changes due to translation.
　In other words, put it all on top of one div, and then move that div in parallel.

Can you even zoom in and out?
　What is the relationship between zoom, scale and transform?
　zoom is non-standard, scale is a kind of transform

Actually, the base on which all stickies are placed does not need to be large (just display the overflow).
　Verification.
　I was able to ✅.
  Scaling with scale

viewport
　[100vh, it would stick out vertically].
　I still thought I'd get scrollbars, but the hidden divs were being counted, so I set top: 0.
