Duolingo
>"Duolingo" has conducted [AB testing] 1,800 times so far, resulting in a daily [retention] (*) increase from 13% to 55%.

>We received feedback from users that they wanted to do more of their native language -> language of study, so we did an AB test, which resulted in a 1.5% drop in daily active users. The lesson here is: "User behavior does not always match what you say. This was a common trend in other AB tests. It's important to recognize the problem instead of just putting in the solution as is."
ã€€[User requests do not match actions].
