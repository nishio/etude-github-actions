Interval DP
Dynamic programming with the interval [$ [l, r)] as the domain of definition
[https://gyazo.com/c26ccf2850d1bbdee5d71cea1c3bc249]
 There are several patterns in how to ask for it (sometimes in combination).
　1: [Section DP to be shrunk].
 　Find f(l, r) from f(l + 1, r) and f(l, r - 1)
 2: [Interval DP to be split in the middle].
 	Find f(l, r) from f(l, i) and f(i, r) (l < i < r)
 　O(N^3).
 　　When you can't make it in time
 　　Speed up range summation with phenic trees, etc.
　3: Number of times to remove columns that satisfy the condition from the column
　　Figure from [PAST5L
　　　We can remove a sequence of three elements that satisfy the condition
　　　I want to maximize the number of pieces to remove.
　　　I've done 1 and 2, and I'll do 3 in addition to that.
　　　Patterns in which the remaining circles satisfy the condition after the interval represented by the line is removed.

	[DP L]
	[DP N]
	[ARC108E]
	[Delete Interval] [Remove Interval].
