Mind Map and KJ Method
[In the "mind map" method, which is a "top-down" process starting from the "center", instead of having a clear center, the ability to draw connections between the ends strongly depends on the creator's "inspiration" ability. On the other hand, in the "KJ method," which is a bottom-up approach that starts from the end and works its way up, the connections at the ends are clear, but whether or not the center is clearly organized strongly depends on the creator's ability to "organize information. So both have their advantages and disadvantages. (2011)
