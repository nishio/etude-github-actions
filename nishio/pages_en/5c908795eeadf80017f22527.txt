Trigger to read back
It is beneficial to read something once and then re-read it over time. What [triggers] that [rereading]?
	[/intellitech-en/4.5.3.2 Incremental Reading]
		This is triggered by Spaced Repetition
	[Social Trigger]
		[/intellitech-en/4.5.3.3 Make teaching materials]
	To teach it to others, hitting the original source causes a rereading.

I didn't realize it when I was writing this, but [Scrapbox] is "a system that triggers a read-back by merging links."

[intellitech column proposal].
