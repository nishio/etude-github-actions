Test of preservation
	When the item was moved, the local update flag was not set and it was not saved on the server.
	Compared to "the stacking order is wrong" or "it looks wrong", "I thought I was writing to the server, but I didn't" or "I wrote corrupt data" are much more serious, so they seem to have a higher priority than the apparent test.
	If I want to write a test case that says, "If I do this operation from this initial state, this kind of write should be done to the server," I need to be able to replace the write part to the server with a mock...
	If you try to do something like "save locally when offline," you'll need to disconnect anyway.
