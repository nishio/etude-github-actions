	Put up a diagram of [The Engineer's Intellectual Production Technique] using [CustomImages].
	The fact that the original diagram is from a book naturally creates a sequential order and a museum-like feel.
		But if you have the book, you might notice that the order has changed if you compare them.
		The lack of explanatory text allows for more flexibility in placement.
	Another difference with books is that you can post the important stuff as often as you want.
		If the same figure appears over and over again in a book, people say it's padding,
		The same picture appearing again and again on the aisle wall is a familiar sight in advertisements.

	One of the good points of a micro game is that you can freely decide where and how to make a passageway. In the case of a fixed room, if I wanted to put an iceberg in the room, I would just "put it in the room".
 After I got off the iceberg, I thought to myself, "Now that I'm down there, I'll dig out the lower part of the iceberg and make it a sequential route.

		I decided to make the middle room a dead end and use a teleporter to make the two jumps.

	Mr. Moriya, who worked on VRSandbox at Unexplored Junior, has created something amazing. I can't believe he could make an animation with Enderman!
