bottlenose does not support 5.0
	[PA API 4.0 shutting down October 31, 2019 · Issue #78 · lionheart/bottlenose https://github.com/lionheart/bottlenose/issues/78]
	>It looks to me that bottlenose won't support PA API v5, unfortunately, so the alternatives so far would be to:
		>Use Amazon's SDK. Apparently, you'd have to copy the source code as it seems that it is not available as a pip package
		>Use the amazon-paapi5 wrapper
		>Use the python-amazon-paapi5 wrapper
