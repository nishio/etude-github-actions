運要素追加案
	[立川 智也]
		Martial arts if there is no element of luck at all. It is fun to watch others do it, but there is a high psychological hurdle for me to do it. For beginners, shouldn't there be more of an element of luck?
		If there is an element of luck, you can blame luck when you lose and try to play again. If there is zero element of luck, it becomes obvious that you're not good enough.

		In case you are wondering, we have designed expansions in the past to include an element of luck, but no one wants to try playing with it, and having an element of luck (in the execution phase) makes it much more difficult to read and turns it into a non-reading game.

		As for luck, I think it's good to have a lot of luck in the early stages of the game, and then be able to turn around about 70% of the overall difference in luck toward the end of the game by using your own ability.
		The game "Agricola," which has many enthusiasts around me, has a strong luck element at the very beginning, where you have to choose 7 cards out of 100 unique cards, and after that, it seems to proceed almost solely on the basis of your ability.

		Okay, if you only put luck in the beginning and not in the execution phase, then you don't have the problem of making it difficult to read.
		For example.
			Deal out some command cards as a hand.
			During the placement phase, you can put your flag on a card in your hand and insert it into the program
		I'll note this as an expansion idea.

		Perhaps, instead of describing it as luck, it could be phrased as non-public information.
  	[nishio.icon]Surely that would reduce misunderstandings.
  Like a card that allows you to give one face-down card to both players and then insert it into the next square.
  	[nishio.icon]I was imagining doing this in the flag placement phase, not the execution phase.
