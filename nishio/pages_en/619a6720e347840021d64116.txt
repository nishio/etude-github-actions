Recognize the unrecognized through dialogue

 [/tkgshn/recognizing the unrecognized through dialogue].
In the Nishio way of writing, "through dialogue [we] notice blind spots."

I feel that it is common to "notice blind spots through dialogue".
　What is this "dialogue"?
　　It is not required to be voice
　　The other party does not have to be human (like [Keichobot]), but there is some kind of quality change.
　　It doesn't have to be one-on-one.
　　[Learning through dialogue].
　　　>Condition 2: If you have faith that "the other person's reasoning is working correctly
　　　Ah, this seems to be the basic premise.
		>Mostly in face-to-face conversations ([chit-chat]), when someone uses a word I don't know, I often say "I see...".
　　　I don't have much sympathy for this.
 　　　In a recent specific example, I was impressed by a "word I thought I knew well" like "interesting" and found a surprising discrepancy when I carefully delved into what I thought about it with someone who is not me. I imagined the phenomenon of "I feel satisfied with the scenery from the other person's point of view.
 　　　　What you get is not a "new word" but a "new perspective on an existing word."
 　　　When something like this happens, search for "interesting" in your past writings and look at them from a new perspective, and you may discover even more new things!
 　　This is probably the kind of situation I'm talking about.

 　　　　1: Mr. A mentions X
 　　　　2: Mr. B, who was listening to it, mentions Y as relevant to it
 　　　　3: Mr. A does not know Y, so he asks a question
 　Mr. A is certainly getting a new Y in this situation.
 　But I think this is "get the top of the pyramid."
 　　[Taking the top of the pyramid is not what I expected].
 　　Mr. B stabilizes Y by building up
 　　If you just keep getting the tops, they'll fall down, and Mr. A needs to take the time to acquire the boxes to fill in the spaces in between.

　　　　　　What if I draw it in more detail?
　　　　　　　[https://gyazo.com/cc64bdadc7333455bdac141dd27cc046]
　　　　　　　First X and Y need to be connected, then other roots are needed to stabilize Y
　　　　　　　　[It needs three legs to stabilize it]?
 　　Maybe "acquiring new words" makes me nervous because it still feels unconnected.
