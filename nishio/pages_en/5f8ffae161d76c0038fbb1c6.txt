　Thoughts.
　　You can't make 1 when everything is even.
　　If there is a pair whose greatest common divisor is n, then n can be made.
　　The ball you used is also returned, so once again, if you subtract n from the largest number m, you can make all multiples of n less than or equal to m.
　　 There are cases where this m is not a multiple of n.
　　 If n is not 1, then find the largest ball for every remainder of mod n
　Official Explanation
　　This is a mistake.
　　　>There are cases where this m is not a multiple of n.
　　　Because we're looking for a public commitment.
　　Policy is OK.
