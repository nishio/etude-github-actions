Macbook trackpad for scaling and parallel movement
I want to use two-finger gestures on the trackpad to move an object in the browser up/down, left/right, and zoom in/out.

結論
　These operations are communicated to the browser in the wheel event.
　deltaX, deltaYに縦横の移動量が入っている
　ctrlKey: true for pinch
　The wheel event is PASSIVE by default, so to stop the browser's default clone operation, you must first turn PASSIVE off.
		`window.addEventListener("wheel", onWheel, { passive: false });`
		see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener EventTarget.addEventListener() - Web APIs | MDN]

Parallel movement on Macbook touch screen
　[Detecting multi-touch trackpad gestures in JavaScript https://kenneth.io/post/detecting-multi-touch-trackpad-gestures-in-javascript]
　Wheel events have X and Y.
　　(Z is also available)
　ピンチの場合はctrlKey: true
　 Seriously? (It was serious.)
