reward and punishment for one's past performance
	Mr. A provides value X to Mr. B
	Mr. B provides consideration Y to Mr. A
	Mr. A finds this activity rewarding.

Under the circumstances.
	Third party C felt that "consideration Y is less than value X".
case, Mr. C may refer to this as "rewarding exploitation".

The term "rewarding exploitation" unnecessarily provokes strong emotions.
 The "consideration Y is less than the value X" is subjective to the third party C.
 	It's just a "lose-lose deal" based on subjectivity.
 Labeling it "rewarding exploitation" creates the misperception that objective facts exist.
 	Creates a bias as if "Mr. B is evil" is a fact.

I think it's [an inappropriate abstraction], so I think it's better to delve into "what exactly is the problem?"
