human instance
It is like an [instance] of [EC2] with a [CPU credit] limit because [human] will die if it keeps running at maximum performance, but it is necessary to keep applying a moderate [workload] because unused credits cannot be stored without limit and expire rather quickly.

	[CPU Credits and Baseline Performance - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-credits-baseline- concepts.html]
 	>1 CPU credit is equivalent to running one vCPU for one minute at 100% utilization.
  For instance type t2.nano
  CPU credits received per hour: 3
  Maximum accumulated credits: 72
		If you take a day off, you can work hard for 72 minutes, but if you take more than a day off, you won't accumulate more than 72 minutes.
