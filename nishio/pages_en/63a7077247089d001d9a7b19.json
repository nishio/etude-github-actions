Is "men are taller" a large subject?

I think there is ambiguity in the original "men are taller"[/villagepump/nishio.icon].
 A: If "men are on average taller than women" is an observed fact and True
 B: If "All men are taller than women," then False because it is a strange assertion that contradicts the observed facts.
 　This is [subject matter is large].

from [/villagepump/ "Men are taller" is the subject matter bigger?]
