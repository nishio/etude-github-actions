passive hub
 Summarize the story of how some people with [communication] problems are actively problematic and some are passive.
 There's a total acceptance type hub that exists.
 People assume that a strong communicator will send a request to start a session himself, and that's not true.
 Some people don't initiate sessions themselves, but have open ports.
  I don't want to get involved with people on my own, but if someone contacts me, I won't say no.
   People like that need to be protected because they're easily fooled by the wrong people.
 I've observed active people over the years, so I've started to imitate them sometimes and send them requests to start a session, but I think I'm basically a passive person.
 One active-type person can build a network of 30 people.
 So we don't need a lot of active personnel, and we don't all need to be active.
 And active personnel don't have to keep working.
	Once a small, dense, mutually beneficial community is established through the activities of active personnel, it is maintained because the community itself creates incentives to belong.
 That is, until the so-called crushers came in.
