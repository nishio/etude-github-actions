Scrapbox period
I've been blogging since I don't remember when, but I started writing on Hatena Diary around 2007.
I started using Scrapbox around 2017-04 and officially announced the end of my Hatena Diary usage on 2018-03-07.

Q: Why did you quit Hatena Diary?
　A: The announcement of the end of the service of Hatena Diary seems to be 2018-08-30, but I have been looking for a good place to migrate for a couple of years, foreseeing the end of the service

	>I've been using Scrapbox mostly lately... I have been thinking for a while that it is time to move to Hatena Diary because it is obsoleted, but compared to Hatena Blog, Qiita, Medium, etc., Scrapbox is rather goofy.

	>Scrapbox seems to be the most serious within the scope of observation about the direction of how to turn stocked information into structured information.

 [/organize-ideas]: project I was making around 2017-04
 →I heard the opinion that it's better to put all the projects in one place rather than dividing them into separate projects, so I put them together in /nishio

[/oculus-go]: I split the project because I thought it could be edited by multiple people, but it wasn't, so I absorbed it
