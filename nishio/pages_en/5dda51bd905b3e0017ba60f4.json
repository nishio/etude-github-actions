Assist in mapping unknown areas
[Question]: How can a program assist humans in the process of creating [conceptual maps] of [unknown areas]?

What is [map]?
	Common [metaphors] used in [Scrapbox]:.
		[Roads are connected]."
			The idea of "[we] hope to find it in the end."
		[People remember places not by their latitude and longitude, but by the route they take.]

What does it mean to "[grasp the map]?"
	You can predict where you will end up if you take this road #predict where you are going #predict
		It allows you to explore without actually going on the road.
			This is similar to [speeding up trial and error] with [brain models] #models #trial and error
		[Discover the path to the destination by [brain search], and then follow that path to reach the destination #search #route
	Does this apply to [conceptual maps] as well?
		[The Paradox of Search]
  	If you know what you're looking for, the problem doesn't exist.
   If you don't know what you're looking for, there's no way you can find it.
		I don't know "[destination]" for a conceptual map.
			If you know what you're looking for, you can find it by searching for keywords.
		So what is grasping the conceptual map?
			Possibly related to
				[Associative connection]
					Unlike a physical map, the goal is not to reach a destination.
						The goal is to find a connection between two seemingly unconnected concepts
				[consistent binding].
					To create a system that is consistent and large is an end in itself.
					[knowledge integrity].

I was thinking about it and this was born.
