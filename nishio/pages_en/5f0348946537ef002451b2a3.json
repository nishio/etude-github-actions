	Competitive Game Read-Out Issues
	DP with the board as the domain of definition
	　The board can be represented by a single integer.
  The value is "the person who is handed the board wins or loses."
  Tracing backwards from the end of the game where there is nothing left to take and you lose.

code:python
 def solve(N, K, AS):
     AS.sort()
     MIN = AS[0]
  
     table = [0] * (K + 1)
     for i in range(MIN):
         table[i] = -1  # LOSE
  
     for i in range(MIN, K + 1):
         for a in AS:
