Increase WIP
[Article for people who are told to "take action" but don't know how to do it｜Kensaku https://kensuu.com/n/nd5f599b47bbe]

考察
	A situation where the initiation of a task is left to an internal determination.
		People who are not accustomed to acting on intrinsic motivation often tend to zero-task
		WIP=0→1" is beneficial.
	Conversely, a situation where task initiation is left to an external command
		People not accustomed to saying no often multitask.
		WIP=many to one" would be beneficial.

[It's going the other way, but the goal is the same.

別の解釈
	Intrinsically motivated tasks can be left unattended if you are not motivated to do them.
		So you can have more than one WIP.
