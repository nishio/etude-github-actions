The staff of time is stronger than the iron cudgel.
It is easy to get [enthusiastic] and see only the option to act now. But sometimes it is better to wait for the right time.
Especially when you are in a dispute with someone else and now feel the urge to hit the other person.

Hold it.

It is a sign of a noble heart that is never in a hurry, never in a frenzy, and has learned patience. If you want to dominate others, first dominate yourself. You must pass through the circumference of time before you reach the center of opportunity. A wise reserve seasons the ends and matures the means. The crutch of time is more effective than the iron cudgel of Hercules. God Himself does not chasten with a rod, but with time. He spoke the great words, "Time and I will oppose them both."
Fortune gives first prize to those who wait.
