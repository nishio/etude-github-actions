[/blu3mo-public/ how to recognize the past in the time line].

interesting
　I hadn't thought of this idea.
　There is a convention of adding [iconography] when people talk to each other, and we use it for books as well.
　　It's a quote from a book, but it looks like a virtual person speaking.
　　　I once created a Twitter bot that would reply to Twitter with excerpts from books, but it would be interesting if the Scrapbox bot replied with book quotes in iconography.
　If there are many pages growing out of one book, if we use the current Scrapbox for links, we will have [the problem of too large links], but on the other hand, we want to be able to "follow" them from the individual pages.
　　The solution with its current specs... as I was writing it, I thought [Scrapbox's link specs are wrong]...
