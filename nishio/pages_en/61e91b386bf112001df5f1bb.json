Note: Why I hate keeping the same
From footnote of [(4.5.3.1-2) My failure: a service to help review]

At that time, a service [Tumblr] was popular. Tumblr had a function that you can easily create an excerpt from a webpage by selecting a part of the contents plus one click. It seemed to be good for making a leverage note. However, Tumblr provides a function "reblog" to copy and re-post the posts of others. By this function, Tumblr shows the same post repeatedly. I felt bored and thought that keeping the same content was a bad idea. I did not understand its value at the time. Later, with the advent of similar features like Twitter's "retweet" and Facebook's "share," I finally realized that this function was not for knowledge creation but information propagation.
