Something that is not Scrapbox

At [something that can be rewritten mechanically
 Co-editing is not that important in my use case.
 Then why not ditch collaborative editing and instead create "[something that is not Scrapbox]" that is easy to [update mechanically]?
This was discussed.

Wanted features
	[Merging Multiple Projects]
 	Merge and display multiple JSONs placed in a data folder into a single project without the work of compositing JSON.
  If there are pages with common names in multiple projects, why not just display them with an apparent concatenation anyway?
  Enable to use JSON obtained by API as well as exported JSON
  	This means that other people's projects are also apparently merged.
 [Mechanical Generation of Pages]
 	[There is a concern that the house will be trashed.
  Therefore, if you try to experiment with the current situation
  	Export your own projects
   Import to another location
   Additional import of generated JSON
  	view
  requires a procedure called
  	If you want to modify the JSON generated by looking at it, repeat the process again.
   The API for the import itself does not exist, so you are forced to work with it.
  	care
  If there is a merge view of JSON in the folder above, simply update the local JSON file
	Link to local PDF
 	I hear Gyazo will eventually have a PDF upload feature...

Discard function
	Co-editing should seriously be discarded.
 	Not even a page lock is needed.
 Editing capabilities would be nice to have, but that's not a priority either.
		Scrapbox's line-by-line editing is useful, but seems cumbersome to implement
  A Hackmd-like structure with a textarea on the left and a preview on the right would be sufficient.
