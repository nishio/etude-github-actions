Ritual of the revival of subjectivity
The energy to be active, proactive, [proactive] seems to wear off and take longer to recover when overworked.
But this idea itself is a false assumption, and it is possible that you feel depleted when in fact you are not depleted of anything, what do you do about this?

If energy depletion is imaginary, then the countermeasure to it is also imaginary faith. So, I decided to take the quick way out and drink a bottle of drink and it's been a while. The idea that I should go out for a walk to breathe oxygen came to me, so I walked to the park. Walking faith.

I bought a Morinaga Ramune to get in on the glucose faith.

We have been parading around for two hours. To finish off, we buy the black bitter liquid (coffee) that is the belief of the largest faction and go home.

Hideki Kondo: The energy metaphor sounds good, but I wonder if it is more likely to cause the structure of temporary memory and knowledge (that constitutes the context?) to be disorganized and scattered. I wonder if it is because the structure of temporary memories and knowledge (what constitutes the context?) is disorganized and scattered. So, the solution is "tidying and cleaning up".

The clutter metaphor is convincing. The rhythm of life has been badly disrupted by a series of events. By misinterpreting the disruption of rhythm as "I am tired and need to rest," we may have confused our sense of the days of the week or woken up at different times in the morning, resulting in an inability to sleep properly at night?
