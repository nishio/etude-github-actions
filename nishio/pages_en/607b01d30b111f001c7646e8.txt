Self-intellectual production program
I realized that there was no "self intellectual production program" as an extension of the current write-out chat system, so I asked for advice on how I could create one.
[About the "Do-It-Yourself Intellectual Production Program"]

　Chatbots are working on the side of humans and are less likely to be autonomous.
　　I like the feeling of a human being going to see it occasionally as it moves on its own at a greater distance.
　　Specifically, Twitter bots, etc.
　　　I think a bot that silently edits Scrapbox would be interesting, but the API is so subtle that it's hard to do.
　Wise words bot as a first step in "worthwhile output."
　　implementation proposal
　　　Make it a generative model
　　　Give him a large article and he'll cut out a one-tweet sized piece from it and tweet it with the source.
　　　I made it once at a hackathon.
　　In both cases, "information fragments that have been cut to the size of a single tweet and are easier to distribute" are generated.
　　You can tell how much people value it by the number of reactions they get.
　"It inputs information on its own, without human manipulation, and outputs new and useful knowledge that did not yet exist in the world."
　In order to realize "enter your own information," you should collect information not only from data given by humans, but also from your own Google searches.
