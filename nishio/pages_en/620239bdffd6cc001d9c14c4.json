Assumption that the written text is understood
We usually write Japanese sentences and assume that the Japanese people around us understand them, but is that true?

It is not possible to directly observe whether others understand.

A computer can do it partially.
ã€€If I can understand both English and Japanese, I can verify that the machine translation results are correct.
