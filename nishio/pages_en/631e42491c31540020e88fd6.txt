>Humans don't know the prompts, so "Oh, what's this?" That's a fun way to have some fun. I'm trying to make it appear when you click on it.
> It's like a museum, first you see it in the distance, then it gets bigger as you get closer, then you see the description.
> I think I'll make a virtual museum with an entire building filled only with cat paintings...
> With this technology, you can put any image on your microsystem: [Microsystems for Engineers' Intellectual Production].

memo
	✅I have 1000 cat images generated by Stable Diffusion and 600 of them labeled "nice" by Mr. and Mrs. Nishio, but I have a feeling that it's time to let the computer create the prompts!
　Find the difference in speed between single precision and semi-precision with (PASS)A6000
 	See what difference the output makes
 	→ about 2 to 7 times faster, right?
 	[Speed of half-precision arithmetic]
　(PASS) Add filter tool functionality
　plan
 　　"Move it all together to NOT GOOD."
 　　Remove this prompt."
 　　EDIT this prompt to add."
 　→Pass because the automatic generation of prompts has reduced the need for manual operations.
 (pass) Is there a difference between "by X" and "in X style"?
  I'll pass on that kind of thing, since the automatic generation of prompts absorbs it and eliminates the need for humans to understand it.
　Mastering the art of inpaint
　　I was able to ✅.
　🤔Automatically post to Insta.
　Create a painting style network in Scrapbox.
　　Automatic submission to Gyazo
　　JSON Generation
　It's like using Thompson sampling for automatic prompt generation...
　I have switched the output folder by the date of generation, but I have not been able to solve the problem of "adding to the folder while reviewing" when I want to "review today's minutes" at 9:00 p.m. (I can just wait a day to be okay with this).
　 Need the ability to give instructions that say, "We're going to start the review now, so write in a different folder next time."
