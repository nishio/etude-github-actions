Make it while listening to ChatGPT
[nishio.icon]Vercel environment, how to make it?
[ChatGPT.icon]... Create a project
From the Vercel dashboard, create a new project.
[nishio.icon](Oh well, let's look at the Vercel dashboard)

What is the difference between [nishio.icon]Next.js and Nuxt.js?
[ChatGPT.icon]Next.js is a React framework and a framework for developing React-based web applications. Nuxt.js, on the other hand, is a Vue.js framework and a framework for developing web applications based on Vue.js.

I created a Next.js project in [nishio.icon]Vercel and it was created in JavaScript. what if I want to do it in TypeScript?
[ChatGPT.icon]5. Convert the code to TypeScript
Finally, the JavaScript files in the project must be converted to TypeScript files. This is done by changing the extension to ".ts" or ".tsx". You will also need to convert the JavaScript types in your code to TypeScript types, if necessary.
What about [nishio.icon]?

OK

$ npm run dev
OK

I want to create a chat screen-like thing in [nishio.icon]Vercel, what should I do?
[ChatGPT.icon]
	Selecting a front-end framework
		First, to build the chat screen, you need to choose a front-end framework to use: React, Vue.js, Angular, etc...
	Select a backend
		Next, you need to choose a backend for your real-time application; Vercel provides serverless functions that make it easy to build a backend for your real-time application. Serverless functions can use languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript.
	Design the chat screen UI
		Next, the chat screen UI must be designed. This includes sending and receiving messages, listing messages, and displaying user information.
	Set up real-time communication
		Real-time applications require that communication take place in real time. This can be done using protocols such as WebSockets. Libraries and frameworks can also be used to implement real-time communication.
	Deploy with Vercel
		Finally, you need to deploy the front-end and back-end code in Vercel: from the Vercel dashboard, create a project, upload the code and deploy it.

I think it would be nice to create a chat screen-like thing in [nishio.icon]React and call a serverless function in Vercel with a send button.
[ChatGPT.icon]
Below are the basic steps to implement this feature.
	Create React components
		First, create a React component to design the chat screen UI, which includes a message list, a message input field, and a send button.
	Create serverless functions
		Next, create a serverless function in Vercel. This function is used to receive and store messages, and to handle requests and responses.
	Handle form submission events
		When the submit button is pressed, a form submit event is handled in the React component. Within this event processing, a message is sent to a serverless function.
	Calling serverless functions
		Within a React component, the fetch function is used to call a serverless function. fetch allows you to send a message to a serverless function. The fetch function can also process the response from the serverless function.

Make [nishio.icon] sample code.

Hmmm, I wonder if someone at the level of asking this question, would be able to see the implicit any error and know that it needs to be properly typed.
As for the second error, you said you have id and content as properties when you initialized it with a string to begin with.
