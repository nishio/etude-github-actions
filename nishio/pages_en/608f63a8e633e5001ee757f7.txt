Logical and rational
A chat about how [logical] and [rational] are different, and how logical maximizes [correctness] and rational maximizes [utility]."

Maybe it has to do with "the breadth of the scope in which logical correctness holds." A rational choice is a logical action that, in the narrow scope around that choice, "I choose because it's beneficial," but "Is it consistent with what I said five years ago?" I don't care if it is.
	[Silly consistency is the ghost of narrow-mindedness]

The monarch is rational because "[a] monarch is a leopard."

Q: Is logical worthless?
A: No, no. Being "locally logical" is insanely valuable, but being "big picture logical" is not so valuable. Because as the scope expands, humans are unable to gather enough information to make a decision. Even if you try to be "logical" by making up the rest with your imagination based on insufficient observations, you will come to a garbage conclusion because the information on the premise is mixed with garbage.
