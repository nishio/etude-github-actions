>It was April 1980, three years after he graduated from Nagoya University and started working at the Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute, when he was 30 years old, that Mr. Kodama filed a patent application for his "three-dimensional figure creation device. However, in 1985, he turned to a patent attorney's office...
>(From a model of a house) Two months later, he applied for a patent. Over the next year, he submitted papers to journals in Japan and the U.S., explained it to machine tool makers and others, and presented it at conferences.... The response was nothing. It was not well received at the research institute, and because of the coarse precision of two millimeters per layer, it was not taken seriously by manufacturers who were competing for machining accuracy of less than 1/1000th of a millimeter.
>The first to put it to practical use was American engineer Charles Hull, who applied for a patent in 1984 and launched 3D Systems, Inc. in 1986.
> ... A little earlier than Mr. Hull's patent application, a researcher at the Osaka Prefectural Institute of Industrial Technology also applied for a similar patent. In other words, it is clear that since Mr. Kodama, similar ideas have been born here and there, including by 3M in the U.S., but taking a step forward in anticipation of future possibilities was by no means an easy task.

I think this story should be better known. I especially like that there are pictures. I hope it will be known that when something new is born, the first step is as awkward as this, and that there will be fewer "adults who can't see the future" like the ones around me at the time.

[new is ugly].
