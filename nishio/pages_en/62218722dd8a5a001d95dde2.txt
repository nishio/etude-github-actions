competency
Competence is a set of demonstrable characteristics or skills that enable and enhance work efficiency and performance. The term competence first appeared as a concept for performance motivation in a paper written by R.W. White in 1959; in 1970, Craig C. Landsberg defined the concept in "Planning an Executive Development Program"; 1973 the term became widely known when [David McClelland] published an article entitled "Testing Ability Rather Than Testing Intelligence." It was subsequently popularized by many, including Richard Boyatzis and T.F. Gilbert (1978), who used the concept in relation to performance improvement. However, its use has varied and has led to misunderstandings.
