50 KJ method assumes 10 hours
Jiro Kawakita wrote clearly about how long the [KJ method] takes.

I used to think "Isn't it too short?" as a personal feeling, but from now on, I can point out "That is not KJ method in the narrow sense" as Jiro Kawakita says. However, from now on, I can use this as a basis for pointing out that "this is not KJ method in the narrow sense of the word" as described by Jiro Kawakita.

>First of all, [integrated fireworks] can be put together in a short time, but the KJ method takes some time. For example, for 40 to 50 pieces of material, it takes 2 to 3 hours for integrated fireworks, and about 10 hours for KJ method. In this sense, the integrated fireworks is a simple summary, while the KJ method is a full-scale summary. In addition, in terms of the conclusions that emerge, the integrated fireworks is a summary that can be used on the spot, whereas the conclusions obtained by the KJ method can be used over a long period of time.
