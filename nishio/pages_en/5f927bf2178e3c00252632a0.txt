　Thoughts.
　　The query is 10^5
　　The size of the board is 9,000
　　A linear order will not be enough to find the requested value from the board in time.
　　Even with constant order, if you have to do "10^5 times, increasing by 1 from 1 to 90000" as a nasty problem, you still won't be able to do it in time.
　　I mean, the number is 90,000 and the query is 100,000, so we should expect a lot of overlap.
　　In other words, where costs add up, they should be cashed.
　　First, create [inverse mapping table] from numerical values to coordinates in linear order
　　Then, for each remainder divided by D, make a [cumulative sum] of the D books
　　　This would be of linear order if the inverse mapping table
　　If you prepare this far, one query will be of constant order.
