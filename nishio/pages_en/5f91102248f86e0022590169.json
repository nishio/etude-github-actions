["Bleach," 20 https://amzn.to/3ocbcK9]

An internet meme that spread along with the frames of the manga "Bleach". Strong words make you look weak.

A person who lacks confidence in his/her own assertiveness makes himself/herself appear strong by using strong words, but contrary to his/her intention, those around him perceive him as a "weak person who is trying to be strong.

>I believe that people use strong words when they are talking to themselves. In other words, self-reflection. Strong words are backed by "conviction," and that conviction is usually based on "what I saw in myself. Therefore, when you strongly deny or affirm someone, you are "unconsciously talking about yourself" in many cases. The presence of the listener is just for show.
