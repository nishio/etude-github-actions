The purpose of prototypes is to fail.
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643782029216206849] #Unexplored Junior Question Box Q: [prototype] [failed]. Can I write that I have a prototype in my proposal even if it is a failed prototype? If the document passes, you will have a new prototype based on the failure by the time of the interview.
> A: Of course you should absolutely write it. The purpose of a prototype is to fail (continued)
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643783231760928768] In the idea stage, it is just "I think we can achieve our goal by doing this.
> When you make a prototype, it is not what you expect. This will help you see where the idea needs to be improved. If you can see it, you can improve it further.
> "Not as I expected" is not only a "failure" but also "[progress]"!
>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1643783964002484225] Especially with regard to document review, "those who have not made a prototype" and "those who have made a prototype but did not write about it because they thought it was a failure" look the same. It is better to write, "I made such and such a prototype, but such and such a problem occurred, so I am going to do this next time. This can only be done by the person who actually made the prototype.

> In my way of speaking, the purpose of prototype development is to learn quickly what you don't know until you make it.
> Since most development fails at least once, prototypes are made to learn quickly where and how to make a mock-up.

> It is important to express well the effort you put in. If it doesn't work out the way we want it to, we tend to pretend it didn't happen, but that's a waste of time.
> There must have been some discoveries in the way they were not made, and the efficiency of things will totally change depending on how well you can cook up the value.
>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1643797506931970048] One chance, the last piece that could not be filled may be filled with the help of others.
> If you don't think in terms of what you have done, what you can do to increase value, and what you need to do to achieve it, you will hover between 0 and 1 for the rest of your life.
>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1643798890855145472] [tips for failing positively].
> I was coding and I was like, "Oh, this part didn't work..." and then you can switch to a storyboard. I'd start mocking it up in the middle of the project.
> That's the only way to get feedback from others.
> The quality of failure depends on this last twist.
>[hrjn https://twitter.com/hrjn/status/1643799510886539264] No one blames you for not working, people give feedback even on mocks, and if it's really good, "Come back when it works!" So, I'm sure it will be good.

>That's for finding the route of failure first without damage and avoiding it later in the production.
>Able to fail at prototyping is a worthwhile step forward.
