Easy things are easy, difficult things are possible.
>Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible --- [Larry Wall]

Perlの設計思想。
　Some languages make it easy to get certain [errands] done. But it makes other things almost impossible.
　Another language makes it equally difficult to run any errands.
　Perl was designed to make simple errands easy and difficult ones impossible.

Programming Perl, 2nd Edition (1996), by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen and Randal Schwartz. Its preface starts with:
>Perl is a language for getting your job done.
>Of course, if your job is programming, you can get your job done with any "complete" computer language, theoretically speaking. But we know from experience that computer languages differ not so much in what they make possible, but in what they make easy. At one extreme, the so-called "fourth generation languages" make it easy to do some things, but nearly impossible to do other things. At the other extreme, certain well known, "industrial-strength" languages make it equally difficult to do almost everything.
>Perl is different. In a nutshell, Perl is designed to make the easy jobs easy, without making the hard jobs impossible.
