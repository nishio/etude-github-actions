conditional liability
>The point that there is "[requirement] debt" in addition to "[technical debt]" is true, and it is very good that the term "requirement debt" can now be used to refer to it, making it easier to compare it with technical debt. It is the same composition as when the term "technical debt" was created so that it can be compared to financial debt.
>> The goal of "dumping the old system, rebuilding it, and wiping out the technical debt" is usually accompanied by an accumulation of requirements debt as well as technical debt, so replacing the system without reducing that debt and without someone who knows the requirements well will result in more technical debt than before. If the requirements are replaced without reducing the technical debt, the technical debt will be even greater than before.
