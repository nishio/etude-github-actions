do not pursue those who leave, but choose those who come to you
There is an idiom, "[Don't] reject those who come, but don't chase those who go.
I don't mind not chasing those who leave, but I think we should be selective about those who come.

We do not pursue those who leave because we prefer to see unprofitable communities shrink and fewer operational resources consumed. [Make a lot of them and let them die out naturally].
[choose what comes] to prevent a beneficial community from being diluted and losing value.
