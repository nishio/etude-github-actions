Limited Rationality and the Limits of Cognitive Capacity
	What is [limited rationality]?
 	Intending to be rational, but having only limited [rationality] due to cognitive limitations.
  In 1947, [Herbert Simon] proposed in Administrative Behavior
  [Oliver Williamson] laid the foundation for the economics involved in [transaction costs].

>Limited rationality (bounded rationality, French: rationalité limitée) refers to the fact that an economic agent intends to be rational but can only have limited rationality due to the limitations of cognitive abilities. This is the concept of human cognitive ability proposed by [Herbert Simon] in "Administrative Behavior" in 1947, and Oliver Williamson used this concept as the basis for his economics on [transaction costs].

>Based on bounded rationality, Simon (1952) proposed the hypothesis that "economic agents do not maximize an objective function such as utility, but rather set a desired level of achievement for it and do not seek alternatives to further improve the value of the objective function once a value above that level is achieved. This is called the satisficing hypothesis.
