Parable of the Bicycle
 All participants could probably ride a bike.
 Now please explain in words "how to ride a bicycle"?
 　Very difficult.

　First, learn to "turn the pedals to go forward" on a bicycle with auxiliary wheels.
　Practice "balancing and advancing alone" without auxiliary wheels
　　I might fall a few times.
　　Do it in a safe park so that if you fall, it won't be life-threatening.
　Then we'll take to the public streets and run together.
　　More traffic lights, cars, and various other "environments to be concerned about".
