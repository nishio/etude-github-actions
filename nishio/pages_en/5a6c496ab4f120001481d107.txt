	I downloaded the template, edited it as is, exported it as a PDF, and emailed it to them.
  Templates are missing because I cleaned out the downloads folder.
  I decided to create a folder in Dropbox with the name of the company I'm dealing with and put it there.
   In addition, I decided to compile all the relevant documents.
   We communicate through Gmail, so I can find it if I search, but the list is not good.

 I guess my side should really publish it properly every month, but I'm forgetting about it right now.
