	　Tips on how to expand on a story
	　　One of the best tips for getting a conversation going between people is to [Answer, Add, Ask]. This means that you not only answer the other person's question, but also add additional information and then ask the other person back.
	　　In this chat system, the program asks the questions. So you answer the questions, add more information, and expand the conversation.
	　　If the program's question is out of line with what you want to talk about, you can direct the topic by adding more information than the answer to the question. The program decides that words that come up repeatedly are important to you.
