Organize in reverse chronological order
For example, in a dialogue between two people, as the dialogue progresses, things that have not been verbalized are verbalized, knowledge on both sides increases, and new insights are gained, so the later the richer the description of the world should be!

Chat logs and minutes in chronological order are good for reliving the passage of time in the process.
But it's not about "[bringing] the important stuff first."
　Bringing important things first is a useful guideline for organizing information for re-reading
　People usually read from top to bottom, so if you put the important stuff at the top, you can adjust the time it takes to read according to demand, such as "I want to know roughly the important parts" or "I want to know every detail.
　　In other words, "[you can] read as far as you want and stop."

What would happen, for example, if [Kozaneba] were to place them in reverse chronological order, starting with the newest statement?

impressions
　Kozaneba sorted out some of the words that were not mine, which were split into multiple posts.
　I didn't see a strong advantage to organizing in reverse order to the time line.
　　What I thought was "important" after organizing on Kozaneba does not match the "last post" before organizing.
　　　As I was sorting through it, I kept coming up with new insights.
　　Especially when organizing the posts of multiple people, there are cases where some of the earlier appearing posts are quoted, in which case it is easier to do it if the "earlier post" is kozane first.

There are some people who have mastered the KJ method on their own, but the examples of organizations making full use of it are still rarer than the stars of dawn. What is the bottleneck? If the quality of the original label data used for the KJ method is poor, the results will be irredeemable.... It can be called interviewing or fieldwork. The methods and training for fieldwork are severely lacking in many workplaces.
  In [the W-type problem-solving model], the KJ method in the narrow sense is C to D, but he says that if you can't do A to C well, you can't use the KJ method.

  	>The KJ method described by Jiro Kawakita in his "Idea Method" in 1966, the relationship between stickies was expressed only by proximity in the group formation phase, and the relationship between distant ones was not done until the diagramming phase.
  	>In 1977, in "Exploratory Studies of Knowledge," he stated that the information gathering phase before the KJ method is the new bottleneck.
  	>One solution to that problem, described in "Explore Net," states that proximity placement alone is insufficient for organization in the information gathering process, and that it is clearer to draw lines.
  	>He also suggests doing 6 rounds of KJ method.
	  >In other words, the reason why the relationship was expressed only by proximity without adding lines in the first half of the first round of the KJ method was not because they actively thought "no lines are better" but only because they emphasized free movement because it was difficult to achieve both "drawing lines" and "free movement" with the technology of the time.
  	>I thought that drawing enclosures and lines to clarify the groups and the relationships between them, to the point of making them one-dimensional, was a round, and that it should be repeated, which means that I saw merit in having another phase to move them after the clarification of the relationships was done. It's just that at the time there was no way to move it again because it was written with a pen on a piece of imitation paper.
 Awareness during Kozaneba
		>The irrefutable key point: "At the time when Jiro Kawakita proposed the KJ method, it was difficult to simultaneously express information by moving sticky notes to any position and by proximity, and to express relationships among sticky notes by drawing lines between them or enclosing them in a box.
	 	>Kozaneba can do it.
	 	>If we say that this could not be done with the KJ method in a cursory manner, the objection would be "done in the A-type diagramming phase," so it is necessary to emphasize "to do at the same time. We couldn't do it at the same time, that's why we had separate phases.
	 >The reason why we had to choose between abandoning the existing structure and not abandoning it, and the reason why "in order to obtain a new structure, we need to abandon the old one," was because there was no method to make it compatible with the new structure.



It's all connected.

	So, everything is connected, and this still retains the "in close proximity in the original sentence" relationship = existing structure.
 	Now that we have this situation backed up, we can "reach the new structure without painful jumps" if we do "not need to keep the original structure" = "move away from it, destroying the original structure so that the arrows connecting it are in close proximity".
		I wonder if this could be mechanically assisted... i.e. if the proximity is a weak spring, the arrow is a strong spring, and the physics is applied so that the arrow is the right length...
		For the first time I thought I would like a "90 degree rotation of the selection"...
	Hmmm, maybe we can shuffle it around (eh.
	 It would be nice if we could back up the old Ba, copy and shuffle only what seems important (e.g. large kozanne, lined kozanne, groups with titles, etc.) to the new Ba, and if we want to know the context of the old Ba, we can follow the link and see it right away.
	 No, it's not. If what you didn't choose is not copied to the new Ba, the psychological cost of choosing is higher.
  If the structures of the past are hindering the new structures, maybe it's time to fold them up.

 fill in for the rest of the night
	 The KJ method is a method to create new structures by moving sticky notes, but many people find it difficult to create the sticky notes themselves, which are the material for the KJ method.
 	Jiro Kawakita, who proposed the KJ method in "Idea Method" in 1966, stated in "Explorations in Knowledge" in 1977 that the process of gathering materials before the KJ method is a new bottleneck.
 	In this book, Jiro Kawakita argued that the KJ method solves not only the problem of chaotic data, but also the problem of not having others understand what you want to say, and the problem of not being able to understand each other in a team.
 	The resolution of this bottleneck is useful independently of the KJ method.
 	For example, "internal exploration" transforms "something bothering me" in the mind into a form of "sticky note. This makes the fuzziness in the mind into an indelible object called a sticky note, which can be observed and manipulated from a third-party point of view. The importance of organizing the fuzziness and creating a story that can be conveyed to others is increasing with the development of groupware that communicates through text.
 	---
 	So, we've come to the point where "Moya Moya -> Story" is beneficial.
  The parallel would be that "Exploratory Studies -> KJ method" and "Keichobot -> Kozaneba" as a way to realize this. Then, "Kozaneba is not a tool to do KJ method, so it does not have to follow the manner of KJ method, and the quality of the method should be judged based on whether it produces stories and its cost effectiveness.
  ---
  Why is it important to create stories? Because we need to communicate to others what we feel is important and elicit empathy in order to realize a society full of teamwork!
	[https://gyazo.com/8b8fc89303492cf315cbd838a0ec3e85]
  When creating a story from the illustrations on Kozaneba, the story should be selected according to the audience and the message to be conveyed, so that several stories can be created from a single illustration.
	  Here's why: when the goal is to "tell a story and gain empathy," brevity is more powerful.
	  You make the whole thing one-dimensional because the KJ method is not about conveying a message, but about gaining new insights by changing the format.
	 ---
	 Why did you say that the story is different for each recipient?
	  At first I thought "we need a story for people who are looking at Kozaneba from the perspective of the KJ method," but then I thought maybe that's not such a high priority. I realized that it's not such a high priority.
 	 Most people in the world either don't know about the KJ method or only understand it as "moving sticky notes," so even assuming knowledge of the diagramming or writing phases, they don't get it.
  Two important ones are
	  1: Stories that convince the world of Kozaneba's usefulness to them.
 	 2: Stories that convince Cybozu people of Kozaneba's usefulness in achieving Cybozu's vision.
