 shiro 2008/06/03 03:38 I really want to read it. I'd like to read a manga like that. I don't mind if it's a novel.
 
 takano32 2008/06/03 23:14 "Expanding the complex plane (complex field)..." "Is this complex analysis (complex analysis)...? Bataan Euler (Euler's formula), it's pi."
 I don't know how the story goes and what the punchline is, but I want to read it: ！！！！ And later on, "Luke, use the power of ________!" is ironclad.

 Gamma field deployment in opposition!
 
 Let me explain, a gamma field is a circular field with a radius of 100 m. In the center is an irradiation tower equipped with an 88.8 TBq (terabecquerel) Co-60 (cobalt-60) source (see below. http://www.irb.affrc.go.jp/)
 
 It seems to be difficult to create a proper ending and flow of the story while embedding keywords, so maybe a four-frame manga. I wonder if there is a four-frame manga template that can be used to fill in the blanks in the Hatena dialogue.
 
 *1212506935*Last train
 
 If you take the last train to Asakusa, the Asakusa line is very crowded, but when I just got on the Tobu line, it was completely empty. I wonder why. Is it because there are many residential areas along the Asakusa Line and the Keisei Line? The Tobu line is also quite long, so it is not surprising that there are many people on it.
 
 
 Long waiting time. More and more people are coming. There is nothing to do today because there are no books. Last year I used to carry a computer with me so I could write code at times like this, but Macbooks make my back hurt. I wonder if I should buy something like AdS or EMOBILE. I don't know what's new and what's good.
 
 *1212513203*Quantity of special skills
 If we can quantify the "special move-ness" in an appropriate way, we can fight like a bar code battler. As a simple example, a word with many kanji characters in a row is a strike-type attack, and its strength is determined by the number of kanji characters and the number of hits when searching on Google, and if Wikipedia becomes a hit when searching, or if you add additional attributes based on various conditions.
 
 
 Cat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is very strong. Which is stronger, the self-organizing map or the self-organizing map?
 
 
 In katakana, it sounds like it if it ends with "ah" or something like that. Three-terminal regulator. Magnetic=stirrer. Trachoma. Dorosophia=Melanogaster or something pretty cool, but not a lot of hits. Planaria-Planaria is cute, Planaria.
 
 
 Ending in "n" is another attribute that sounds like it. Astaxanthin! Glycyrrhizin! Porphyrin is cute, porphyrin.
 
 
 Are words with breaks in them cool too? Knuth-Morris-Pratt law. Oh, I thought the one with the law at the end should be rewritten to be a cannon without fail. Knuth-Morris-Pratt cannon. Which is stronger, the fastest descent gun or the fastest descent gun?
 
 
 Saccharomyces cerevisiae must be female. Streptococcus mutans is some kind of clownish role. In general, do katakana words seem weaker when they end in "e" or "ns"? I wonder if the more "n" and long sounds it contains, the higher the score will be. And I wonder if it has a cute attribute if it contains "po" or something like that. I think planarian is cute, but plat is normal. Why is that? Plasmas aren't very cute. Plus screwdriver is rather cool. Prime Ministar is a normal name for a technique. But Proton is cute.
 
 
 UTF-16BE or RS232C is some other attribute attack. which is stronger, FireWire or IEEE1394? FireWire is a flame attribute attack anyway. Three or four letters of the alphabet are pretty close to basic attacks, like DNA or FTP...or UDP or HTTP...ATP is a protocol for transporting energy. And if you add something else to it, it's strengthened...RNA Interference...all the RFC stuff...Punycode...Punycode is cute...Punycode...Punycode...Punycode...Punycode...Punycode.
 
 
 The coolest thing would be a term that is a mass of kanji characters and also has katakana furigana, but I wonder what the best way to determine that would be. If you specify two keywords, like "error back propagation method back propagation," you could make the total the attack power, provided that the score for each is high, and also that there are a reasonable number of hits when searching for both. You have both katakana and kanji attributes, and they're strong. But are there many academic terms that are not written in katakana in the first place? For example, words of Latin origin, it depends on whether they are read in Latin or English.
 
 Plus: Words I thought were cool today
 Scanning near-field optical microscope
 Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
 Schopenhauer

 <body>Maybe because more people ride from Kitasenju than from Asakusa in the case of Tobu? </body>.
