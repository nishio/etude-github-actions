 *1238081335* The moon is the merciless queen of the night.
 When I finished reading it, I looked at my watch and it was exactly 0:00.
 
 Impressions. Hmmm. I would never recommend this to someone who is not used to SF in translation. The translation. I was bothered by things such as the different kanji for "hand" and "hand" and the strange way the kana is used. I checked the dictionary and found that "途絶" is not a mistake but "杜絶," so maybe it is not a mistake but just an old translation that makes me feel uncomfortable. But at least I wonder how it is with science fiction to mistake kilometers for meters.
 
 I was told I could read it in Japanese and then read it in English, but it wasn't a story I wanted to re-read in English. I just checked and it was written in 1965 (<a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%88%E3%81%AF%E7%84%A1%E6%85%88%E6% 82%B2%E3%81%AA%E5%A4%9C%E3%81%AE%E 5%A5%B3%E7%8E%8B'>The Moon is the Merciless Queen of the Night - Wikipedia</a>), it must have been an amazing imagination considering its historical background. Real-time voice synthesis, video synthesis, etc. The year BASIC was born. 7 years before the C language was born (<a href='http://www.infonet.co.jp/ueyama/ip/history/history_ct.html'>History of Computers (Timeline)</a>).
 
 Greg-Egan's "One Child" and "The Theory of Everything" also arrived. Diaspora" arrives tomorrow or so.

 I don't feel too comfortable hearing "take the test."
 
 I don't feel much <b>comfort</b> when I hear "take the test."
 
 I don't <b>feel</b> too much discomfort</b> when I hear the phrase "take the exam.
 
 An example of a boomerang.
