 **1218758218*Spectacle-shaped camera

 20,000 yen~. That's surprisingly cheap. I'm curious. It's hands-free, so you can record the scenery you ride while riding your bike. See the video below.

 But, of course, it's blurry. I wonder if in the future it will be possible to eliminate the blurring software-wise after recording?
 
 *1218761479* Kumon for Adults
 >>
 The power of the Kumon Method in elementary school is immense, man.
 Japanese and arithmetic are easy, and if you can do Japanese, you can do social studies, and you can handle science.
 However, it also means that if you save too much, you will learn to play and just eat away at your savings.
 Even if you don't study for a while, you can still get a good score.

 I see.
 Then why not have questions that don't affect the most recent test score (but whose effectiveness can be objectively measured as an exam), Kumon for TOEIC 900, Kumon for Bookkeeping Level 1, etc.?
 
 *1218780921*MacBook's gcc is out of date.
 Oh, I just realized it's gcc4.0.1. sudo port install apple-gcc42 and install the new one.

 Something like sudo port install gcc42 was the right answer.
 
 *1218799342* Ah,
 I was going to go check out the <A HREF="http://gigazine.net/index.php?/news/comments/20080814_harimayahonten_okaki/">free cafe</A> that just opened within walking distance from the lab, but I forgot. But I forgot.
 
 
 I heard a typhoon is coming tomorrow. I will probably buy vegetables at the supermarket and try to cook by myself.

 I'm home...sign of having left my MacBook AC adapter at work.
 
 *1218806569*[TopCoder] Next one Sunday at 1:00.
 And yet you forgot to bring the AC adapter.
 
 I thought it was 1:00 tomorrow so I thought I could take a little break, but it's 1:00 the day after tomorrow. I guess I'll just have to make tomorrow a NoPC day.
