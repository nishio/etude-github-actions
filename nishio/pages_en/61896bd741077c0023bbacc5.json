My wife is trying to do something about ticks, but I don't know if it's worth doing unless I have a way to observe whether it's effective or not... I looked into it and found a way to measure the effectiveness by myself, so I decided to give it a try.

　The reason there are so many Roombas is that the dust collected by the Roomba from a large area was put into the inspection kit, so there would be a lot of dust. I did it to see what would happen if there were too much.
　Before I took the measurements, I thought, "Is the bed tick-proofing not enough?" "Is the cat tower the cause?" But when I looked at the measurement results, it was clear that the sofa was the problem.
　Reason for measuring the foot and head sides of the bed separately.
　　Dust mites eat bits of epidermis, so they may breed more in the open head and face area than in the clothed lower half of the body.
　　→ Rather more on the foot side as a result of the measurement.
　　　Perhaps the overwhelming effect of "the futon does not cover you when you are not sleeping, so it is easier to dry".
　　　Why are there so many sofas...
