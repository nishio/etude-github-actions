Insufficient information task list
Common problems with [Task Management
 Write down tasks that are not to be done immediately or on the same day.
 After a while, you think, "Okay, I'll do it," and then you look at the task list, and it's [Insufficient Information] and you don't really know what you need to do.

What we do now
 I'm tempted to blame my past self, saying that I should have written it down better.
 But doing so will not improve the situation at this moment.
 Leaving the situation unchecked will not improve it.
 First, we'll do one pomodoro, task clarification.
 Still, anything you didn't know what to do with was not a task.
	 A "fragment of a memo that was once considered a task and written in the task list, but due to lack of information, it is no longer clear what should be done" is not a task, but just a fragment of information.
 Nothing should be on the task list that is not clear what is to be done.

For your future self
 After a lull, he blames himself for the past, saying, "You should have left the information with me.
 When I wrote it, I thought that I would know this level of information when I wrote it, but that perception was not correct.
 	It's not that I didn't leave the information properly, but this cognitive distortion is bad.
 Write with a level of detail that tells others what not to do immediately because your future self is a stranger.
 If you don't have time to write down the details at the time you write it down, clean it up before you forget.
	 Schedule a "clean-up" task.
	 Before I forget = probably within a week at most
