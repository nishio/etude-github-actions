work as life
 I have misunderstood the concept of work-as-life until now.
 [The idea of "work-life balance" is to separate and oppose "work" and "life," but it might be more useful to separate "stressful" and "stressless" rather than to use that approach. Proposal
 In the process of living as a working adult, I somehow became infected with the meme of "work and life" as opposites, clearly separating [work] and [rest], and feeling as if [I had to take a day off on my days off].
 But "not being able to do the work you care about" is a source of [stress].
 It's okay to work on your days off! Life is more satisfying if you say, "I can work on my days off!
 This type of discussion is difficult to communicate because each person's labor environment is different. #Each person's environment is different
 　For those who are already loaded beyond their capacity with stressful work, holidays are a limited chance to restore balance, so the statement "I can work on my days off, yay!

	This is an example of a [false dichotomy].
