> The name "X" was mispronounced as the Greek letter "alpha" by a foreigner who scribbled "X" on the back of the ninth inning column of a baseball scoreboard. For a while, newspaper articles used the initial "A" for "alpha," but this was soon discovered to be a mistake and the current "X" was used.
