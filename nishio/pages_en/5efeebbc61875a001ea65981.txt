PyPy also JIT compiles the contents of gcd, but Cython assumes that gcd without a type declaration is a function that inserts and removes objects, so it converts variables declared as int to objects every time.

Yes, AC 785 ms for [Cython], faster than PyPy.
code:python
 cdef gcd(int p, int q):
     cdef int r
     while q:
         r = p % q
         p = q
         q = r
     return p
  
  
 def main():
     cdef int ans, i, j, l, K
     K = int(input())
     ans = 0
  
     for i in range(1, K+1):
         for j in range(1, K+1):
             for l in range(1, K+1):
                 ans = ans + gcd(gcd(i, j), l)
     print(ans)
  
  
 if __name__ == "__main__":
     main()
