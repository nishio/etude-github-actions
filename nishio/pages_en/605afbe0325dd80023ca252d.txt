✅A substring that appears but is not selected for keyword extraction is considered a keyword occurrence.
For example, if "lecture" is extracted as a keyword and then the statement "make lecture materials" is made, if [Keyword Extraction] extracts the range of "lecture materials" as a keyword, this would result in "B" being extracted independently of "A," which is not appropriate. In this case, "lecture" should also be regarded as appearing again.

Added [✅Recurrences of short keywords are not treated as keywords].
