Habitica
Gamification system that gives you experience when you complete tasks.

 Habit: Can be done many times a day
 Daily routine: can be performed once a day and again when the day changes
 Task: Disappears after one execution

It is tempting to use the existing "task management tool" metaphor to register tasks, but the order of the tabs is important.
Tasks have a registration cost each time. A daily routine is a penalty for each day it is not done. Habits can be performed any number of times without penalty.
So, except for one-off tasks, we moved more and more into habits.
For example, I had included "going to work" in my daily routine, but I reconsidered that this is a "habit" since some days I don't go to work and some days are weekends.
Also, "going to the office" is too big. It would be better to divide it into "going to the station" and "getting on the train," etc., so that the experience can be gained even when going to a place that is not the company.

The bias to make habits "small and easy to implement" due to the desire to gain lots of experience fast
This is good.
Thinking about gaining more experience breaks down the task once registered.
