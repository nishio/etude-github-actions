avoid an overflow
[https://gyazo.com/cb41dd0c4760ec22eec0daa71ff28aad]
　There is a container that can hold 20
 　Container contains 10.
 　Now there is a chance to get 20
 A: Let's get 10 now!
 B: Let's [procrastinate].
 　10 overflowing and lost if you try to gain now, what a waste!
 　Better to get it after consuming the 10 already in the container.

Which is better depends on the situation, but I think in many cases people inappropriately choose B.
　Because B tends to overlook "the loss of delay in action" and "the possibility of losing the opportunity to gain 20 while procrastinating".
