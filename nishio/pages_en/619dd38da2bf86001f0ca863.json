[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "question" is that "question"?
[/nishio/human.icon][Symbolic modeling] Questions that emphasize not distorting the speaker's thinking, created with reference to a technique called [symbolic modeling].
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "thinking" is that "thinking"?
[/nishio/human.icon] Or rather, there are already "metaphors that have not yet been verbalized" in the speaker's mind, and we help to bring them out in the form of words without distorting them.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "not yet verbalized metaphor" is that "not yet verbalized metaphor"?
[/nishio/human.icon]A structure created in the speaker from past experiences, which often takes the form of a metaphor during the verbalization stage.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "metaphor" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon]The concept of metaphor is abstract, but I guess I have to explain this to get the point across. Indeed.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about that "metaphor"?
[When things are verbalized, they do not always come out in a form of expression that can be understood by others, but first come out in the form of personal metaphors. It is not useful as a "tool to communicate" because it cannot be conveyed to others as it is, but it is useful as a "thinking tool" because it is like a handle attached to one's vague thoughts to manipulate them
[/nishio/kei.icon]Where is that "metaphor"?
[/nishio/human.icon]We're just coming up out of the sea of "things not yet verbalized" that come from the user's mind.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you value?
[/nishio/human.icon]Putting thoughts into words is very beneficial, and groupware supports the sharing of "what is put into words" but does not support the "putting into words" itself. If we can support this, teams consisting of multiple people will be able to function better, and that's where I feel the value lies.

It is useful as a "thinking tool" because it is like a handle to manipulate one's vague thoughts.
 How do you know this "metaphor"?
[/nishio/human.icon]As you are talking, you realize, "Oh, this is similar to that one.

It is useful as a "thinking tool" because it is like a handle to manipulate one's vague thoughts.
 Where is this "metaphor"?
[/nishio/human.icon]While you are talking, the image swims close to the surface of the sea of "things not yet verbalized" and you scoop it up with a hiyui.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "verbalization" is that?
[/nishio/human.icon] "We talked about a lot of things, but metaphorically speaking, it's like what?" with a posteriori metaphoric [handle].
[/nishio/kei.icon]What do you hope will happen regarding that "metaphor"?
[It would be good if it were better known that the process of verbalization is often accelerated by the creation of personal metaphors, and that the creation of these personal metaphors can be accelerated with the assistance of this software.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What needs to happen to the "metaphor" for that to happen?
[/nishio/human.icon]The concept of "metaphor" is abstract and difficult for the uninitiated to grasp, so this itself needs to be made easier to grasp.
[/nishio/kei.icon]With respect to "metaphor", can it?
[/nishio/human.icon]I don't know, never thought about it, worth the challenge.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > The concept of "metaphor" is abstract and difficult for the uninitiated to grasp, so this itself needs to be made easier to grasp.
 What does this "metaphor" look like?
[/nishio/human.icon]I guess I need to be able to explain that. So far, it's been the "object to scoop up" and the image of a "fish", but I can't pinpoint the part where scooping up a fish makes it easier to verbalize.
[/nishio/kei.icon]Is there anything else about that "verbalization"?
[/nishio/human.icon]If verbalization is "making words understandable to others," then "making words" comes first, and then "polishing them into a form understandable to others" comes later.
[/nishio/kei.icon]How do you know its "verbalization"?
[/nishio/human.icon]You can tell if you've been able to put words into words that others can understand by throwing them at them and seeing if they catch them.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "word" is that "word"?
[/nishio/human.icon]Mm.
[/nishio/kei.icon]
 > The concept of "metaphor" is abstract and difficult for the uninitiated to grasp, so this itself needs to be made easier to grasp.
 Where does this "metaphor" come from?
If you're talking about where [/nishio/human.icon]personal metaphors come from, it's from personal experience. If you're talking about where the notion that metaphors are important came from [Eugene Gendlin].
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "concept" is that "concept"?
[/nishio/human.icon]I guess I'll have to put together a summary of Eugene Gendlin once in Scrapbox rather than chatting about this now.
[/nishio/kei.icon]What kind of "speaking" is that "speaking"?
