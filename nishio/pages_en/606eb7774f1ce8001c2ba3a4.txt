Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto
We adhere to the following principles
	Customer satisfaction is our top priority, and we deliver value-added software quickly and continuously.
	We welcome changes in requirements, even if they are late in the development process. By making change our ally, we boost our customers' competitiveness.
	Release working software in as short a time interval as possible, from 2-3 weeks to 2-3 months.
	The business side and the developer must work together on a daily basis throughout the project.
	We bring together motivated people to form a project. We give them the environment and support they need, and we trust them to get the job done.
	The most efficient and effective way to convey information is to talk face to face.
	Moving software is the most important measure of progress.
	Agile processes promote sustainable development. It must be able to maintain a constant pace on an ongoing basis.
	Constant attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
	Simplicity (maximizing the amount of food that can be made without waste) is the essence.
	The best architectures, requirements, and designs come from [self-organizing teams].
	They regularly reflect on what the team could do to be more efficient and optimally adjust their methods accordingly.

>The most efficient and effective way to convey information is to talk face to face.
	I highly doubt this.
	At the very least, if they claim to be "most efficient," they should provide evidence.
