neither 0 nor 100
[https://gyazo.com/f2eb2f9e09b7485dc59ca25f95bd727e]
[series of drawings in which two people say different things]
　Mr. A. "I don't think zero is good."
　Mr. B: "However, 100 is not good..."

This diagram is called "0 and 100" so it is easy to see that there are other ideas in between
　Is 30 better, 50 better, or 70 better?
　　This is currently ambiguous
　　Neither A nor B verbalized it.

In reality, "ambiguous and unverbalized options" are difficult to see, which tends to lead to perceptions like "there is a plan A and a plan B".
　[False choice of two].
