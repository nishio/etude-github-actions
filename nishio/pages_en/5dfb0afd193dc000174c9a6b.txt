Misconception that "making DM public increases the amount of information."
Thoughts on the opinion that "taking [private communication] to [public channel] increases the amount of information and prevents it from being passed around" #DM

	It's because of a system that doesn't distinguish between ["I can see it" and "I want you to see it"].
		Whether the lack of distinction is due to software specifications or the way the work is run is irrelevant.

	Making information public increases the amount of information that can be "seen".
		If the information you "want" to see is properly [mentions], then that's all you need to see.
		Failure to distinguish between "may see" and "want to see" information leads to "want to see" information being mixed in with "may see" information.
			→I end up having to watch the whole thing.

	Responsibility to Mention" Culture
		If the sender did not mentions the information he/she wants the receiver to see,
		The sender is responsible for any problems caused by the recipient's failure to read it.
	If this culture is established.
		The sender mentions what they want you to see.
		Recipients see preferentially what is mentions.
		→ No amount of other "look good" information will be a burden.

	The burden on the reader and the burden on the writer
		If the information is publicly written and pointed to by permalinks, it's less work for the writer.
			Just point to it and say, "Look at this."
		If the information is only in the DM or other places where it cannot be pointed to, there will be copy and paste and other hassles.
		[Disadvantages of email-based communication].
