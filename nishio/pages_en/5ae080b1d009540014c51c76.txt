Correct understanding means being able to apply it.
 The purpose of reading is not to understand the author's opinion
 Reading a book and understanding it correctly means being able to apply what is written in the book and derive useful results.
 Correct understanding means being able to apply it.
  That pretty much sums it up.

>I just realized that from the standpoint of pragmatism, which defines correctness in terms of usefulness to one's life, "reading a book and understanding it correctly" is not "understanding what the author meant" but "being able to [apply it] and derive useful results". It's possible that it's easier to realize what the author was trying to say, but it's not a must.
