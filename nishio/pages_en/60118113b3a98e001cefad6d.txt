　　Purple managed to pull from all over the existing plant as appropriate, but the conveyor belt became spaghetti.
　　Considering green design...

  Hmmm, maybe I'll make a fresh start on a new continent...
 Automatic production of green cubes has begun.

 　All assembled in Tier 1, 4.4/min.
 　　The bottleneck is the silicon supply, well, we're making it from stone. I wonder if we can pull a conveyor belt from the spaceport to here.
 　4.4/min means you can make 10000 pieces in 38 hours, so you could leave it on through the weekend.
 　After trying out a box of silicon with a plentiful supply, I found that the next bottleneck is double deuterium. This is troubling...we'll have to build an accelerator.
　　After building the accelerator, the next bottleneck was graphene. It was hard to tell because it was pulled from far away so there was a buffer on the belt, but graphene was consumed when carbon nanotubes were made to build the accelerator.
　　Oh, we can make graphene and hydrogen from Jupiter's burning ice. We could build a spaceport nearby to supply silicon, graphene and hydrogen.
	They say it's luck if there is a FireIce on Jupiter at the start.
