I think it's the most efficient and time-effective way to improve the completeness of the code based on error feedback, rather than making sure the code is correct word for word. If the premise is to debug on paper for the entrance exam, it seems to me that a different ability is required from that.

If by "the power to live" we mean only the [physical] body, that may be fine, but modern society no longer allows us to live by that alone.

　We're going to do it [roughly first].
　Create [opportunities to get feedback
