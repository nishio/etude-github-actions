Art in the Age of Reproduction Technology
[Art in the age of [reproduction] technology.]
	Critique written by cultural critic [Walter Benjamin] in [1936
	>Mechanical reproduction has freed works of art from their parasitic dependence on [rituals].
		[Religion and political authority were the driving forces behind the creation of art.
	>"Instead of being based on ritual, [art] is beginning to be based on another practice--[politics]." For Benjamin, [the politicization of art] had to be the goal of [communism], as opposed to [fascism], which [glorifies] politics for [the control of society].
