Importance of the ability to think about what to make
>As [the evolution of programming languages] increases [the efficiency of program production], the relative importance of the ability to determine "[what should be made]" will increase.
[Supplement #5b7a511faff09e00007b17a4 to Why Invest in Intellectual Production Techniques]

In the past, I insisted on this.
Is this claim True?
	rebuttal
		Increased program production efficiency lowers the cost of creating the program.
		Lower costs allow more programs to be created at a given cost
		Cheaper to make than to pay the time cost of scrutiny.

orthographical variants
	"[What should be made of]."
	What to make."
	What [should be made]?"
