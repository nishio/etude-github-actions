 **1259668911*[Kaizen] Tidying up the paperwork bin.
 This shelf was filled to the brim with documents. The shelves were pointless and wasted a lot of space, the unprocessed documents piled up because of poor management, and I could have bought pull-out shelves but didn't, creating a lot of invisible space. I threw out all the stuff I didn't need and put the stuff that needed to be processed or kept in the clear side pockets, and it all fit in 6 pockets. What a surprise.

 Well, to be honest, I had three puffy clear pockets on the two bottom shelves. That's because, you see, the probability is very high that it's something I don't need if I haven't pulled it out and referenced it once since I put it in there. Maybe there are receipts from 5 years ago or something in here.
