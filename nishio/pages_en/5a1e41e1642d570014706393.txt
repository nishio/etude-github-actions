parable of the bridge
 boundary spanner
 A person who connects the boundaries
 Span is "straddle", so the image is straddling a wall.

ã€€pipe
 Image of two different areas connected and objects flowing through them.

	go-between
 Use it as a bridge between IT and pharmacy.
 The bridge straddles a boundary (river)
 Connecting this side of the border and that side, people come and go.
 It can be said to be a fusion of both boundary spanner and pipe images.
