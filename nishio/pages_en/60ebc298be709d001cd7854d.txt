overload
Putting multiple concepts on one word.

>Multiple definitions or overloading is a mechanism in programming languages that allows multiple definitions of functions or methods with the same name (symbol) and the same operator symbol, and allows multiple operations to be performed by selecting them according to the context of the program when used. The overload is a mechanism that allows multiple operations to be performed by defining multiple functions or methods with the same name (symbol) and the same operator symbols in a programming language and selecting them according to the context of the program when used. For example, the same "abs" function can be defined for integer, floating-point, and complex values to obtain absolute values, and functions can be defined for each type to return a name or ID with individual meanings.
