 *1192083466* Design of UI
 
 If I think about it, if I design an "easy-to-use UI," I would probably end up designing something very out of the ordinary.
 Because pointing devices are trackpoints, trackballs and tablets. What is a mouse.

 Filling in the context, "My hermitage is a series of pine groves, near the sea, high up on Mt. Fuji. ？？？？？" I guess it's like that.
 I googled it.
 In a poem by Ota Dokan, he wrote, "My hermitage is a succession of pine groves, and near the sea, I can see Fuji's high peak through the eaves.

 Mellow sake

 I wonder if it reads, "You and your retainer love each other, and your prestige and virtue shine through. I wonder if it reads, "You and your retainer love each other, and your prestige and virtue shine through."
 The lower impression is also difficult to find. Cinnetsu Seikozo?

 It's Japanese, but I can't read it cleanly at all.
 The impression is... um... mellow ride? Kome?　The only place I can make out is mellow.

 Hmmm... *Rekien?

 Peasant Shomei Republican Manbang, I guess.

 The context suggests that it is mellow and unparalleled, but the "yang" is heavily stylized.

 This is probably <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9A%87%E7%B4%80">Admiral Jinmu's accession to the throne - Wikipedia</a>, though I could only read about the emperor and the date of his accession.
 It looks like it says 2555 in the year of Emperor Jinmu's accession to the throne A.D. In western calendar year, 1895?
