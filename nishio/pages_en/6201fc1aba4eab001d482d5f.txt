Warehouse of dead texts
It's a mixed metaphor.

A [warehouse] is usually a place to put away "things to be taken out and used in the future.
You don't put dead people in a warehouse. It is the graveyard where we put dead people. [Graveyard of dead documents].
What is the state of the text being "dead"?
　There's "not to be updated in the future" and "not to be referenced in the future."
　Even texts that are not updated can generate new sprouts from them.
　　[case study of new shoots growing out of a socially triggered dead text].
