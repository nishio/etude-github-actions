It's ridiculous to look down on outcomes that are loosely constrained.

For equally good results, those produced under tight constraints are more impressive, but the fact that those who are trying to produce results under tight constraints but have yet to do so are emotionally repulsed by the results produced under [lax constraints] and are trying to feel superior through mysterious [condescension] is ridiculous from a perspective that does not care about the constraints. It is comical from the viewpoint of those who are not interested in the constraints.
