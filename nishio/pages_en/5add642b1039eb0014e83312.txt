Radar Charts and Knowledge Distribution Charts
	[Knowledge distribution maps and radar charts are almost identical in what they represent].

	 Maybe people are more familiar with radar charts.

 The picture I drew in [Specialist and Generalist] is similar to the mapping between a radar chart and a knowledge distribution map

 Radar chart has discrete regions of definition, but the knowledge distribution map is continuous
 	I believe the "knowledge domain" is not discrete, but continuous.
  The knowledge domain that many people imagine may be discretized
  Even in my descriptions of various things, I often discuss them in a discretized definitional domain of about one or two points.
  	Like, "I know engineering and I know business administration."
   In this case, it MUST not be a continuous knowledge distribution map

 The radar chart is limited to a finite definitional area.
		This is unacceptable to me.
		It creates the misconception that "everything is in plain sight."
		It's important not to overlook the fact that "new territory is being created."

  	New fields of knowledge are being created all the time.
 	The knowledge distribution map has no edges and is infinite.
  But then I thought about it, and I never really explained it properly.
  	[Increased Knowledge Domain]
 	For simplicity, I have used one dimension, but of course it is multidimensional.
