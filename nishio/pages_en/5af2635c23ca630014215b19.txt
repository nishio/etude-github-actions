The changing meaning of the word "work"
It just occurred to me that maybe we're talking about different things because the meaning of the word "work" has changed from half a century ago to now.

fact
 In the 13 years since 1990, the self-employed ratio has declined by 20%.
 According to the 2009 edition of the White Paper on Health, Labor and Welfare (2011), the number has decreased to 43% compared to 1961, 50 years ago.

assumption
 For one elder X, "working" means "finding a problem for yourself and getting paid for solving it."
  Problems are the lack of labor, the lack of goods, and the existence of people in need.
	For one young person, Y, "working" means "having an interview with a company, being selected, and doing what you are told to do.

assuming that ...
 X: "Work."
 Y: "They won't hire me."
 X: "Don't be picky, work."
dialogue can be established even if both sides behave rationally.
