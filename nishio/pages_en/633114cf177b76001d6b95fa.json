Attract young people who reinforce their own theories.
>[https://twitter.com/philomyu/status/1574230999676104704?s=21&t=oVG_AVNlZ2wwBti_ylbT8A @philomyu]: I'm an adult myself, so I'm careful not to become what we call an "old person". I'm trying to be careful not to become what the world calls an "old person", but I wonder if it could be explained by a mechanism like "[curiosity wears off]". I wonder if it could be explained by a mechanism like "[abrasion of curiosity].

>I think this "[new idea]" is important as the borderline between becoming an old person and not becoming an old person, and no matter how much I feel like I am inputting information by talking to young people, if I only focus on young people who tend to give "stories that strengthen my [bias]" or "stories that give new authority to my theory," I am going to become an old person. I want to be careful.
