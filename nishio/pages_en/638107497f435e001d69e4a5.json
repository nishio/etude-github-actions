The comic depicts a short but very accurate scene mocking outrage culture. It's hilarious!

　Can I join?
　Go ahead.
　The rules are too difficult. Let's change them.
　No, we've been playing by these rules for years.
　Why are you excluding me?

　You people are not inclusive!
　Let's play a game that "everyone" can enjoy with simpler rules!

　Orcs are humans, too!
　No, no! Their race is literally "orc."

　You didn't even know this game existed until five minutes ago!
　If you don't like these rules, go away and play another game!

It's so bad, it's hilarious.
