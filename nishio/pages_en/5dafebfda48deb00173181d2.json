phenomenological reduction
>This is a term in E. Husserl's phenomenology. In a narrow sense, it refers to the transcendental reduction, and in a broader sense, it includes the reduction of the form. In the natural attitude, we tacitly accept the establishment of the transcendent existence of the world in our daily lives, but Husserl, on the grounds that this makes strict academic recognition impossible, thoroughly reflected on the natural attitude and called the methodical operation of putting it in parentheses and discontinuing judgment transcendental reduction transzendentale Reduktion. He then questioned the meaning of the existence of the world in pure consciousness as the phenomenological surplus resulting from such reduction. However, since the meaning of the world's existence must be sought in subjectivity, he called the reduction of the fact of pure consciousness to the essence of pure consciousness the phasic reduction eidetische Reduktion, which he distinguished from the transcendental reduction. However, his thought was continually refined, and later his idea of phenomenological reduction was revised.

For example, when we are thinking "why is that?", we naturally think "because that is common sense". This "common sense" is an example of transcendental existence, and when we think in this way, we tend to attribute various things to transcendental existence and assume that "that's the way it is. Therefore, it is necessary to look back at such thinking and realize, "Oh, now I have attributed to the transcendental existence of "common sense,"" and to stop attributing to that transcendental existence. This is "transcendental reduction.
