I want to duplicate a sticky note in a snap.

[I want to duplicate a sticky in a snap.]
	Click -> [Balloon Menu] "Duplicate"
	 Duplicate stickies should remain connected to each other.
		 Displayed in the related sticky link

 Mind maps make common marks on branches and leaves.
	 This is in organizing with paper and pen where "select and move" is not possible.
		 Workaround to relate "things that are far apart as a tree but related"
	When there are two related stickies, sometimes it is less expensive to mark them both in common than to move them closer together with a set of surrounding arrangements.
	 Even in Regroup, representations do not always fit in two dimensions, so tools are needed to correlate distant objects.
 It might be interesting to create a temporary view that brings [cloned stickies] placed at a distance to the same position, while respecting the data of the human manual layout.
	 You don't have to automatically rearrange all the stickies, just the ones around the cloned sticky.
 		Take 5 close stickies of each cloned sticky
 		Project each of them into two dimensions, keeping the distance as much as possible.
 	I wonder if it will be like that.
