The attempt to collect "knowledge that is correct for everyone" leads to "content that is [obvious] for everyone," and thus loses its economic usefulness.

>Today a twin leaf emerged in a strange way from the seed of "the tragedy of trying to make a certification exam that is right for everyone, only to have the content become [stale] and old-fashioned" that came up in the recent discussion of the [certification exam]. but because of that, what was collected became "content that is commonplace for everyone" and lost its economic usefulness, didn't it?
