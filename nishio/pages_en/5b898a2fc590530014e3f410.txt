 P1: From the standpoint of using System A, the current System A is not productive because - in Situation B. Can we make it a system that inhibits situation B?
 	P2: I don't use System A because it doesn't achieve Objective C.
	  P1: (Why are we talking about objective C?) Who would do Institution A for Objective C?
			P2: Our system A has a condition that says ~.
  	P1: I see, we don't have that condition. (I guess there are many different companies that have different system A in one word...)
 	P3: There was a person P4 who said that he doesn't use System A because it is ~.
  	P1: (I don't know if the system P4 refers to by the term "System A" has the same conditions as our system, and) it depends on each person and situation.
  P5: I wouldn't use System A.
  	P1: Why do so many people focus on the "to use or not to use institution A" part?

Why the focus on "to use or not to use Institution A"?
	Hypothesis: The explanation of the latter part is poorly worded and difficult to understand, and only "using system A" is recognized as unconsciously going through the process.
 	In fact, there was an exchange like this in another part of the conversation tree
  	P6: Isn't it OK with Institution D?
   	P1: What is OK?
    P6: (Institution A is realizing) To achieve objective E, we need to achieve ~.
    P1: Oh, I didn't mean that, my concern is to "control situation B"
  I think my post is hard to understand when you read it back (I've rewritten it for clarity in the summary at the beginning of this page).
