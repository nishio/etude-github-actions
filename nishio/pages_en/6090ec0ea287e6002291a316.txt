 *1422276973*Experimental log that explains a new feature that led me to aim for a new world.
 he> What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
 I> First, listen to me.
 He> Yes, sir.
 I> I added a mode where the user speaks unilaterally and the program just listens.
 he > user
 I> Yes, and I also set a timer to watch the input and respond when there is no input for three seconds.
 he > input for 3 seconds
 I> Right now I'm still looking at when the input is confirmed, but next time I'll change it to wait until the user starts typing.
 He> still typing
 I> Seeing both the start of the user's input and the submission will give you an idea of how much time you're spending on it.
 he> Start input
 I> I'll send you the time it takes me to start writing and the time it takes me to write it when I send it to you, and I'll log it as well.
 He> Time
 I> Later, I would like to use this mode to load various drafts, etc., and ask questions about them to help with polishing.
 He> Question.
 I> The end.
 He> How do you know when to start typing?
 I> Even if Japanese input is on, the keydown event is still fired, so that's it.
 He> Is there anything else about that Japanese input?
 I> No.
 he> user seems to be what?
 Me> Like a lamb coming to the confessional for advice, I want my story heard first. Instead of being bombarded with questions from the start, you should first get out everything you've spewed and then ask questions.
 he> What kind of room is that room?
 I> There is a listener and a user, and the confidentiality of the conversation is maintained.
 he> What kind of user is that user?
 Me> I guess I'm alone for the time being. Even though I have it running on a server, I only have one conversation memory. Before making it multi-user, I would first like to fully understand the needs of my user.
 He> What is it that you value?
 I> questions, prodding, listening, secrets, I guess.
 he> Where does that thrust come from?
 I> Unexpected questions make me aware of perspectives that I was not aware of when I wrote the original text, and thus give me the opportunity to improve my writing.
 he> What is between that anticipation and perspective?
 Me> Anticipation is a view from an older perspective.
 he> Where do you see that perspective?
 I> Well, maybe around the eyes.
 He> Where is that perikana?
 me> ngkw.
 He> Then what happens?
 I> Improvements to better writing will help readers of that writing to better understand it.
 He> Is there anything else about that sentence?
 I> A text that allows the reader to have a better understanding is beneficial to the author in organizing his knowledge, because it has a good structure.
 He> Then what happens?
 I> If I organize my knowledge and output it, even if I leave that field for a while and the knowledge disappears from my brain, I can easily recall it when I need it again.
 He> What kind of self is that self?
 Me> The kind of person who takes on one new field after another.
 he> What happens next?
 I> Trying a new field brings you out of your shell.
 He> Where is this self?
 I> On the borderline between the world I already know and the world I don't yet know.
 he> What is between that boundary and the world?
 Me> That's a very difficult question. I don't know.
 he> What happens just before that?
 I> Just before entering the borderline, you fight the desire to return to the middle of the world you already know, to the zone where you feel safe, surrounded by what you already know, and you move on to the more unskillful and unskillful things in the world you already know. In doing so, you see a world you don't know.
 He> What is between that true and the world?
 I> The center is the center of the world.
 he> What happens next?
 I> When you can see the unknown world, then you can aim for it. Before we can see it, we can only move away from the center because we can't specifically aim for it.
 he> Where does that world come from?
 I> There are already countless worlds that I don't know. However, if we are not careful, we become comfortable in one of them and ignore the world other than the one we live in.
 He> that yourself what do you want to happen?
 I> I want to travel around the world and find something of value in each place.
 He> What would need to happen to you for that to happen?
 Me> I overcome my fear of leaving the center of the world and find the next world.
 Can he> do it himself?
 I think I can do it.
