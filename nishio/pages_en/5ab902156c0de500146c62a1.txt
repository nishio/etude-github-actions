A profitable company is not a good company.
	There are two ways a company can make a profit
 	Increase money (sales) received from customers
  Reduce the cost you pay

	Increasing sales is a decision left to the customer.
 	Customer decides to buy the product.
  So ultimately uncontrollable.

	If you want to ensure increased profits, you have to cut costs.
 	Stop Investing for the Future
  Curtail employee salaries.
  Stop social contribution activities that do not lead to profits

A company with high profits does not equal a good company.
Drucker: [Profit is a condition, not an objective, of an enterprise].
