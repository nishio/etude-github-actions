 <a href='http://blog.tokuriki.com/2013/02/post_738.html'>[Morality]The story of how fighting back on Twitter against those who spew venom on the internet is all risk and little to no benefit. </a>, which I associate with the philosopher born in 1601, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/? _encoding=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&field-keywords=%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%B6%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B0%E3%%83%B0 83%A9%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3&linkCode=ur2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks">Balthazar Gracian</a> says.
 
 - Ignore people's slander. It is wise to respond with silence. Do not appeal to the power of the pen to clear your name. What is written will remain forever, so instead of punishing your enemies, you are helping them to keep your name. There is no revenge better than oblivion.
 - Do not fight with others. There are few who will fight fairly. The enemy will try to use whatever is available, even resorting to sneaky tricks that he shouldn't. He will get nothing out of it, but it will give him the slight satisfaction of getting back at you. He has nothing to gain by doing so, but it is enough for him to feel a little satisfaction that he was able to get even.
 - Do not fight what you have nothing to lose. Even if you defeat your opponent, you cannot get back what you have lost.
 
 I guess people haven't changed much in 400 years.
