 *1478924205*Tried Google Translate.
 I will translate the Japanese I wrote using Google Translate, which has been talked about for its improved accuracy, and verify whether or not the meaning can be understood and whether or not the English sentence is comfortable.
 
 >>
 What is Moyamoya?
 <<
 
 Well, I understand.
 
 >>
 The purpose of this book is to solve the "Moyamoya on programming".
 <<
 
 I'm not comfortable with the closing position of the quotation marks and the, but I get it.
 
 >>
 Everyone is learning programming, "What is object-oriented? I do not know like I understood ..." You may have felt moaiyoya such as.
 <<
 
 This looks like it needs to be rewritten. I guess I can't translate it because the original Japanese has a complicated structure that includes the string "I don't seem to understand...".
 
 >>
 In this book I would like to help solve such mooyamoya and refresh it.
 <<
 
 Maybe we should cut it down after AND.
 
 >>
 Moyamoya is not understood, I do not understand well, I can not understand well.
 <<
 
 Moyamoya is a mental state such as "I do not understand well" or "I can not understand well."
 
 >>
 So what is understanding?
 <<
 
 Yes, it seems to be communicated. I wonder if articles are not necessary in such cases.
 
 >>
 Makoto Nagao wrote in "What is" Understanding "" Understanding the sentence is to reconstruct the written content in the reader ".
 <<
 
 The quotation marks are all over the place, but, well, it's understandable.
 
 >>
 Moyamoya is a state in which the knowledge input to the brain by sentences etc. does not connect with other knowledge that he owned, fluffy floating.
 <<
 
 I think the original sentence is rather difficult to translate, but the translation is understandable. My English conversation teacher often says that Japanese people use "etc." too much, but I don't think "by sentences etc." is necessary in this sentence either.
 
 >>
 Even in this state, you may be able to spit the knowledge as it is like a parrot as it is.
 <<
 
 The "as it is like a parrot as it is" is subtle. I am not sure if "as it is" is necessary for "like a parrot as it is" or not. If I had to translate it, it would be "as if you were a parrot," so it would be you, not it.
 
 Also, I'm concerned about Japanese-style ambiguous expressions. If I were to write it in English, I think it would be clearer to say "Even in this state, you can spit ...". It would be clearer to say "Even in this state, you can spit ..." if written in English.
 
 >>
 However, we can not connect it with another knowledge.
 <<
 
 In context, this we is a mistake for you.
 
 
 Let's try something a little more technical.
 
 >>
 First, it is a concept of "implementing general functions in superclasses and implementing specialized functions in subclasses"? This is a design policy that superclass is generalization of subclass and subclass is specialization of superclass. This design policy matches the idea of &#8203;&#8203;"class = classification".
 <<
 
 No, why the question mark ....... If you fix that, you can usually get the meaning.
 
 >>
 The second one is the idea of &#8203;&#8203;"extracting the intersection of multiple classes as its superclass?" This is a design policy of "extracting common parts" that is similar to mathematical factorization rather than generalization / specialization. This design policy matches the idea of &#8203;&#8203;"sharing common parts of processing" already familiar with how to make functions.
 <<
 
 This one is also in question form. I checked the original text, and it says something like "The idea is that we can extract the common parts of multiple classes as their superclasses." I think that's the reason. I think it's because of that. Also, the previous sentence is "concept" and this one is "idea.

 Impressions from the Experiment
 
 >>
 It is not satisfactory quality as it is, but probably it can be passed as it is. Since you can see what you want to say in most places without referring to the original text, the labor of the work of correcting the translations made in Google Translate will be much less. Perhaps in this state you could also outsource "to correct sentences to be naturally" to people in English-speaking countries who do not understand Japanese.
 <<
 
 The quality is not satisfactory as it is, but it is probably understandable as it is. I can understand what the text is trying to say in most parts without referring to the original, which saves me a lot of time in revising the original translation made by Google Translate. I can probably outsource the work to someone in an English-speaking country who doesn't understand Japanese, and ask them to "fix the text so that it looks natural.
