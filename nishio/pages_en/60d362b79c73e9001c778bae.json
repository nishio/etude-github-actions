What should the editorial URL be?
In Regroup
　Starting with "no authentication, you can edit if you know the URL."
　Read-only links were created because "I want to share it with others but I don't want it to be rewritten."

Meets the needs approximately, but there is the hassle of "managing editable links to keep them out of the sight of others".

Use it so far.
　Rarely shared and co-edited with others in the first place.
　　Then we'll increase the effort to make it editable for others and decrease the effort to share it with others uneditable.

In Movidea
　Google Account Login
　　If you're logged in and included in the map's edit rights, you can edit it.
　　Otherwise, Read-only
　This will make it better to simply share the URL with others in a non-editable way.

　The function of INVITE editorial right holders might be added in the future, but it's low priority.
　　For the time being, "only the author himself."
　　This still doesn't interfere with the author's own multiple devices.
