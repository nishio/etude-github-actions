(4.6) Summary
In this chapter, we have drilled down the process which information comes into you. We focused on reading books. We learned the gradation of "finding information" and "building understanding."

There are at least three processes of information comes into you:

	A: To read books
	B: To talk to others
	C: To do experiments

I did not talk about B and C, but they are also useful. In conversation, unlike reading, you can ask questions. In experiments, we create new information rather than getting existing information from others.

In the next chapter "How to organize information", I explain how you can organize information after you get a large amount of information from books. In other words, we focus more on "assembling understanding" after information gathered.

As you have read so far, you may find that I made this book after reading a lot of books and papers and finding much information. What I did in the process of shaping those pieces of information into a book together, I explain it in detail in the next chapter.
