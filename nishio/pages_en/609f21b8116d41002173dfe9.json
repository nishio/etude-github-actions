Place comes before people
Some may disagree that this was a factor in the spread of Zoom, but I thought that the point of view "design that determines the place first, not the person" was a perspective that could be applied to the design of other services as well.

>[VoQn https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1393040322867851268]: As for the question, "Why Zoom and not Skype or GoogleMeets? It's not about "connections (contacts)", it's about "sessions (meetings) first", which is very modern.

>[VoQn https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1393040807867740165]: Skype and Meets are both about "creating a session with someone you know, to talk about something", but Zoom is about "allowing you to call the person you need to call (without knowing their direct contact or account), to talk about something". Zoom is "to make it possible to call people (without knowing their direct contacts or accounts) in order to talk about something".

In today's world, where social graphs are much more common, it is easier to scale if you can create and throw a URL for each session, rather than assuming that the contact information (account) is held by each other.

>[VoQn https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1393043147098263557]: This is also what made Clubhouse so popular: "We don't require each attendee to have a relationship value to the 'content' of what we say, only a willingness to participate in the topic. This was the difference.

>[VoQn https://twitter.com/VoQn/status/1393046440516067329]: The trend of "removing the 'adhesion' from the topic/session to the connection/social graph" itself has been around since Meet was Hangout. Gitter / Discord is a model in which the "topic" of the gathering comes first, and then people come to it.
