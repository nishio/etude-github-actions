Parable of the Hungry Beast
hungry beast
A case of starvation of appetite

When we use that metaphor for humans
A case of sexual hunger
is easy to imagine

In fact,
By a pudgy, middle-aged, starving beast with a hunger to be seen as someone important.
I think the mentality of young people is being eroded.
