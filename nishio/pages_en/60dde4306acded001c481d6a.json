Should deadlines be less strict?
>Hack for college teachers. If you give homework to students with a "deadline: 23:59 on the XXth," you will receive a lot of e-mails from around 23:50 saying, "I'm sorry it's halfway through, but I'm submitting it! If you give students a homework assignment with a deadline of "23:59 on the XXth," you will receive many e-mails from around 23:50, whereas if you give it a deadline of "Midnight on the XXth," you will get a lot of e-mails with contents that were thought out with persistence until around 5 in the morning.
> Incidentally, the exponential increase in applications just before deadlines, even for internship applications, is a phenomenon unique to Japan (in other countries, the trend is not as pronounced as in Japan), but I wonder where this "deadline defines completion" culture comes from...
