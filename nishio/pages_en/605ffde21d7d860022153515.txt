As I wrote in "[Engineers' Intellectual Production Techniques]," "Teaching others is an efficient way to learn" means that "if you explain what you have learned with the intention of teaching others, your memory will be better retained.
 Intellectual Production of Engineers p.140 [(4.5.3.3) Teaching others] [(4.5.3.3) Teaching others].
 	>Making materials to teach others also reinforces your own memory. After solving a puzzle, writing an explanation of how to solve it will ... There are experiments that show that test scores improve significantly. Just creating the material is effective without actually teaching it.
  [Creating materials to teach reinforces one's own memory].
 An experiment that showed that taking the time to verbalize how to solve a problem, rather than simply solving it, improved subsequent performance.

Understanding
 I don't think it's a good guideline, because people who are small-minded will feel that they don't have a good understanding no matter how much they study, and people who are not small-minded will feel confident with not enough knowledge at all.

 As I also wrote in Intellectual Production Techniques for Engineers, subjective feelings of "understanding" are often wrong, so "[understanding is] a hypothesis," and without "experimentation to test the hypothesis," you will never know if you really understand. Writing an explanation of what you think you understand is a useful way to conduct this experiment.
 As a result of our experiments in trying to explain, we often find ourselves saying, "Huh? This is a bit fuzzy in my understanding. As we find and eliminate such vague points, a "dense network of interconnected information" is created in our brains. Once this is in place, it is useful to be able to trace the connections and pull them out as needed.

 	>You may feel like you know something, but that is no guarantee that you really do. You have to verify that the model in your brain that you think is correct is really correct by actually using that brain model and observing the results.
