The estimated number of days remaining in Chapter 1 is 1.5.
This estimated number of days remaining is calculated by dividing the number of pages remaining by the average amount of progress per day (column name is "pages/day").
Average amount of progress divided by the "number of days since the start of the project, including days not done.
So, "If I work hard today, I'll make above-average progress, so if it's 1.5, I can make it, right?" And so it becomes, "If I work hard today, I can make above-average progress.
