The fastest course is not the fastest
[https://gyazo.com/b9200d91c713a71c7f2e555249c75c54]
	On a curved road, the in-course (A) can move ahead faster than the out-course (B).
	So we tend to think of this as "[the] fastest course."
	But this only means that A is better than B under the [constraint] of "course."
	If we remove the constraints, straight forward C is [fastest] and by far the fastest
	Compared to C, the difference between A and B is nothing.

---
	Are these "constraints" really unmovable, or are they illusions created by the human mind?
	A runs on the inside of the course, a little ahead of B, and feels superior.
		But hard to see, the off-course C is far ahead.
	A thought he was the best, but suddenly C appears so far ahead that he can't catch up.
		A thinks C is cheating.
	From C's point of view, A and B are not much different.
		They took a detour along the rail of illusion. So it is their own fault for being slow, they think.
