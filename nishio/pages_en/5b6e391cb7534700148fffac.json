No separate drafts, etc.
At [Scrapbox Drinkup 20180810], "Do you have a private project?" "Of course I do." "Then are you drafting it there?" I didn't do that." So here's my note.

 [Scrapbox] is not just a tool for neatly scribbling out a document with a fixed content.
 Emphasis on [thinking in writing] and sharing and consulting with others as written.
	In cases where it is not necessary to do a clean copy, spending time on a clean copy is a waste of time. When you are working on a task that is easy to understand and narrow your vision, a mysterious "[sense of working]" tends to arise, but when you think about it calmly, you are simply wasting time by not thinking.
 Don't spend the cost of cleanup on anything other than what really needs to be cleaned up (e.g., product introduction brochures).

  The thought of drafting and then publishing is like hitting the save button, which eventually becomes a barrier to output.
  I've published drafts of my own, and some articles I've let sit for a month.
  I have a draft tag on my drafts.

  They don't even put a DRAFT tag on it.
  You interrupt me in the middle of writing a sentence and leave the table, what's wrong with that?
  I thought you were writing well." Because? In other words, "I thought I wrote it well before publishing it" is nothing more than self-consciousness, and in fact, there is no harm in publishing it while it is still in the process of being written.

Here is what I wrote a year ago about this operation by Dr. Shiozawa
