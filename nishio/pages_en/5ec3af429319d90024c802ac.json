Multi-objective optimization problem
[Optimization problem] for which [objective function] is not unity.
The value range of the objective function can also be expressed as a vector rather than a scalar.
There is no obvious [total order].
[Pareto] superiority becomes [semi-ordered
[Genetic Algorithms], an approach that uses Pareto dominance relationships between solutions to determine the degree of adaptation can be used.
