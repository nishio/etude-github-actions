 ohkubo> My interest in [tarot] in recent years is precisely its use as a "tool", and I found it very helpful. Corepont] is interesting: [Tarot as a thinking tool].
	nishio> Yes, and recently I've been wondering if it would be possible to make a tarot where the symbols on the front have a mathematical or scientific theme, etc.
	o> You could make a card of the 40 patterns of [TRIZ] and carry it with you.
 n> TRIZ focuses on how to resolve the trade-off relationship between physical performance as a basic premise, so you have to abstract yourself one more step to apply it to software or something.
  I wonder if there are any studies that synthesize the metaphors of tarot, Osborn's checklist, astrology, and many other things out there, and do a principal component analysis to extract the 40 most important patterns.
 o> I would like to start with about 12 sheets and increase the number as I get used to it.
  n> I know the first two are "yin" and "yang".
   No, I'd still like to get that out of a principal component analysis, not a human conceptualization.
  o> So next, fire, earth, wind, and water
  n> For principal component analysis, you can choose any N.
  O> I can't imagine a principal component analysis that would work.
   You have Yin and Yang, or Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth, as a basic idea, which makes the whole world MECE. The Major Arcana is not intended to be MECE, but by being constantly aware of it, you gradually classify the whole world into one of the 22 cards. The way of classification is up to each person, and it should be a tool to facilitate Korepon, right?
  n> In order to promote collepon, it is important to be moderately detailed, but the degree of detail depends on the situation, right? Therefore, I thought it would be good to be able to adjust the aperture to "this among 10 pictures", "this among 32 pictures", "this among 64 pictures...", and so on.
   For now, let's collect the explanatory texts of the total of 78 Major and Minor Arcana of Tarot, 64 hexagrams of I Ching, and (10 planets + 4 asteroids) x 12 palaces of astrology from somewhere and find out the main components w
  o> Is there any indication that the starting goal is too big to be aborted?
  n> TRIZ card, already had http://braster.ocnk.net/product-list/6
  o> High.
  n> You could make it in PowerPoint and print it on business card paper.
