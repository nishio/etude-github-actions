Center of gravity feedback during squatting
[https://gyazo.com/08bbc58677a83eb3393a4c8e4c1db89a]
　Correct posture during [squatting] is difficult.
　　Do not bring your knees forward.
　　Don't put weight on your toes.
　　Center of gravity is on the heel.
　　Keep calves vertical.
　...and I don't understand it, even if it's said in words.
　Easy-to-understand feedback
　　Place your feet on a thin book or mat and float your toes.
　　If your toes touch the ground, it's a no-no.
　It is common for people who are not used to this to fall backwards because they cannot maintain their balance when they hold the center of gravity.
　　So you need to hold onto something or have a supporter hold your hand.
