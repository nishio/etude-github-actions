Contains [quinine], which emits blue fluorescence under [black light].
　Purchased here [Amazon https://amzn.to/3cSyfc2]
　I bought it because I was thinking of doing a science experiment video on YouTube.
 I'm satisfied with my own experiments and no longer motivated to make YouTube videos.

Tastes like [tonic water] with a unique bitter taste, not bad.
　I wonder if this unique bitterness is quinine, because quinine has a strong bitter taste.
