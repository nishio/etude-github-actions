Quiet room metaphor
2022-01-23
After immersing myself in the [well] for a while, the metaphors "[quiet room]" and "[lively room]" came to mind.

The well is a lively room, waivering, buzzing, and donning. Stimulation abounds. It is fun.

But if you play there, you will not be able to make progress. A lively room is also a noisy room.

I am tempted to return to my quiet, self contained room to work.

What is "noisy"?
　Stimulation comes in.
　Activity is driven by that stimulus.
　Stimulus exceeded [capacity

The stimulus itself is favorable
　If it's in a place with a lot of undesirable stimuli, they're not going to stay, they're going to leave.
　An uninteresting stimulus would simply be ignored.
　I guess I get tired when the stimulation of interesting topics of interest appears more than I can process.

　Whether it should be connected or not.
　At least I want to turn it off when I'm [inclined to work quietly].
　Because it's not "[quiet]" when the stimulus comes in.

When I tried to understand it properly instead of somewhat, I ended up having to take it back to my room and reorganize it myself, instead of just leaving it there.
