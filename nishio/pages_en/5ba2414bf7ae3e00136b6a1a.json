Sticky note size
[20190205 Tachikawa-san's KJ-method experiment].
	Mr. Tachikawa used 75mm x 25mm sticky notes.
	When I looked in the stationery section of my office for refills, these were there, so I wonder if they are readily available?
	I think this size is possible. image writing a sentence in about 2 lines.
	I'm not sure what effect being horizontal would have, but it doesn't look like it would be particularly problematic.
		Might be hard to draw.
		For me personally, when I print my presentation slides at 25up, it's roughly the same size as a 50mm x 38mm fusen, so I sometimes mix and match.

I wrote a column titled "[Size of Fusen]" on p.152 of [Engineer's Guide to Intellectual Production]. [(Column) Size of a label].
	Stationery is best when everyone uses what they like.
	I prefer to use 50mm x 38mm fusible labels.

	With four or five people, sticky notes can be lined up on a desk and "everyone [can] see around them."
 If you do it on a desk, you don't have to worry about it peeling off, etc.
 75mm x 75mm is too big for [doing it on a desk].
	If you're going to put it on the wall, you should use [a thick pen].
	If you have a tendency to write [too much] on sticky notes, you should also let them use a thick pen
	If you need to clean up your desk quickly, you can pull out a piece of imitation paper and use it to clean up the entire piece of imitation paper.

[Size] of [Sticky].
