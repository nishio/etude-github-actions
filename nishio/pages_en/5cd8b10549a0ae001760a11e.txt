The bias of easy drawing
	[Two-dimensional standard normal distribution] is difficult to draw by hand.
	I'd draw it in circles.
	If a set of people is drawn in a circle, the misperception that "[boundaries] clearly exist" will occur.

		[Organization Boundaries].

	This could be called "[a] false dichotomy."
		There is no clear boundary between "inside" and "outside," yet we assume there is.

	I'd like to come up with a few more examples, rather than just this one example that you're making a page called "easy drawing bias".


	Associations: [Explainability and thoughtlessness].
