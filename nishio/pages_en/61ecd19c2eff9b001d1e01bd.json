  Uke. I agree completely[/villagepump/nishio.icon].

Let's stop using [the legacy protocol of conversation].
 [Careful explanations are not understood.]
 　Because careful explanation increases the size of the information, so it's more likely to overflow from [working memory].
 　The ways to expand working memory are [Reading Notes] and [Kozaneba].
　　The recipient [does not understand fast enough], so the only way is for the recipient [to read slowly].

Everyone understands at a different rate.
　It's not a good idea to strangle the speed of output just because the listener happens to be slow in understanding.
　If the output is replicable content, it can be enjoyed by people other than those who were in front of it at the time of the output
　Some of those people have a much faster rate of understanding.

　[The Parable of the Too Many Seedlings]
　　You can't plant all the seedlings in a small field.
　[Trying to make those who don't understand understand create suffering].
