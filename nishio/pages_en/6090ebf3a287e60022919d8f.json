 *1195695446*Flicker.
 
 I'm feeling bad again. I kicked around a plastic bottle that I had washed and put down. I need to clean up the tangerine peels too.
 
 *1195722445*S6
 S6 Policy on Public Disclosure - IT Warnings

 Oh, I opened PowerPoint to make an introductory slide for Sunday, and then I thought, "Oh, I should make it in the notebook because it's a different version from the notebook," and then I stopped, but I guess it would be easy for something as short as a self-introduction, so maybe I should try using S6. It would be easier to publish on the web.
 
 So I saved the presentation that I had left for now locally and it stopped working.
 
 *1195733772*lambda-ized
 - Make it in a normal class.
 - It becomes tedious to name each method in a class that has only one method.
 - Make them all __call__.
 - It's not a class, it's a function.
 - More and more functions are replacing functions.
 - It becomes a hassle to name functions.
 - It would be fine with an anonymous function.
 - http://coderepos.org/share/wiki/unlambda_lambda_ja
 - I get tired of typing "lambda" every time.
 - I need a keyboard with lambda keys.
 
 *1195735339*PEG parser
 To create a PEG parser combinator that takes a string representation of PEG and returns a PEG parser, write the PEG grammar in the PEG parser w
 
 Ouroboros W
 
 *1195742273*Time out already!
 Ah.
 The question is whether to bring back the parser source code.
 
 *1195743289*The devil is in the last train
 
 A high school girl with amazingly thick makeup was my uncle.
