Motivation Creation Method
	Express work in a Venn diagram of "I want to", "I can", and "I should".
 At [Cybozu], we call this the "[Motivation] Creation Method.
  The concept of what it takes to be highly motivated and "enjoy working".
 I want to, I can, I should.
 	Just looking at the letter, it feels exactly the same as [Recruit's Will Can Must

	[The point that I found eye-opening when reading "The Monster that is the Company" is that it is not the company that decides what you "should" do, but yourself.
		[It's not the company that decides what needs to be done, it's you].
		Example
	 	1: Company has a project that requires full commitment.
 	 2: At home, the wife needs to take maternity leave to support her during the upcoming birth.
  These two "shoulds" cannot be reconciled, then [choice] is necessary
  [I choose what I will do out of all the things I have to do].
  He tells us to make choices according to our own will and to be "[prepared]" to accept the consequences.
	The "I'll do it because my boss told me to do it" mentality runs counter to this.

	Other interesting points
 	Affirm that "I want to do" keeps changing.
  Can do" includes borrowing the skills of others.
  	Use this "Motivation Creation Method" to borrow the skills of others and create motivation for them
