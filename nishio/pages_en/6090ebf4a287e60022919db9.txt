 *1199327400*bool
 The timeit method returns the number of seconds taken after 1 million iterations. bool(x) and not not x differ by a factor of less than 2, but the difference is only 0.3, so there is only a 0.3 second difference after 1 million iterations. In applications where the difference in speed is important, LL should be avoided, and if it is not important, bool(x) should be used for readability. At least that's how my coding style is.

 *1199344197*Icon
 I keep thinking, "I need to make icons for Hatena, Twitter, and so on. But I want to make a unified icon anyway, so I can't make one that is copyrighted by someone else.... I had been thinking "I need to make icons for Hatena and Twitter, but I want to make them uniform, so I don't want to make icons that are copyrighted by others... I want them to be scalable because they require various sizes," etc. When I saw Akimoto's icons, I thought that I had completely missed the point.

 But this is easy to imitate if you want to.... The icon I am using now on mixi and other sites is a composite of one of the frames of a movie I made a long time ago when I made a matrix-style introduction movie of my laboratory, in which green letters fall down and become "COMPARATIVE GENOMICS". Because of the size, some people can't really tell what the picture is of because I enlarged only one lens because they can't see the letters if they try to include their face in the picture. I wish I could make something easy to understand and hard to imitate.

 Rome interesting.

 *1199368375* History is interesting.
 Maybe I should make a wiki for my own notes.

 Which prefecture is ________? You can play the quiz "Which prefecture is XX?" in a variety of ways, ranging from a single point (odds 50x) to "East Japan" (odds 2x), just like playing roulette. If the border between the two prefectures is bordering, you can also choose "Keihanshin" or "Keihanna". This is interesting. It should be included in social studies classes in elementary and junior high schools.
 
 I'll give it a try too. I think Iwate because of the crab and beef ekiben and the manual train doors, but I'm not confident enough to put a point on it... I think the manual train doors are a characteristic of cold regions. I think it is characteristic of cold regions that train doors are manual.
 
 But I remember Shimane was definitely manual too. Well, I'll take Iwate by a point!
 
 But the correct answer is Shimane.
 
 Question 4.
 Japan's largest shipment of leeks. Located in the basin of a large river. Large difference in temperature between cold and hot. Japan's largest production of hina dolls. Paulownia trees are grown in the area. The production area of cannonballs for the shot put. Now where is it?
 
 Ummm.... I wonder if it is in the Shinano River basin. Maybe Niigata. (No evidence at all)
 
 The answer is Saitama. Saitama is the birthplace of leeks. I mean, what river runs through there? Tone River? I heard it is Tone river. Fukaya green onion. Iwatsuki is the place of dolls. Tsujitani Industries for the cannonball.
 
 Question 5.
 -Whale in Osechi cuisine. Whale is good. It's nutritious.
 -- Kansai area? Whale means Pacific side? Wakayama? Kochi?
 Eeeee, just a hint? You don't need to explain how to make Osechi..! Hmmm, maybe Wakayama.
 
 Hey, Nagasaki?
 I see.
 
 In the end, it was all off.
 I wish I could solve more puzzles. And I don't want any annoying teasing because of the program structure. Oh, it's commercial again. I've had enough.

 *1199374125*Rush to get home
 Ahh. The rush to get home.
 I am scheduled to return to Tokyo on the morning of the 7th. I will go straight to the office.
 After returning home, I will prepare for the programming symposium and go on a business trip from 8 to 10.
 Should I write about the details of the "1000 Speakers Conference" on the 19th when I get back or should I write about it first...?
 
 *1199377857* 1st 1000 Speakers Conference
 I thought it would be better to write about the current situation as soon as possible.
 
 - The venue is Cybozu Labs. The maximum number of participants is 30. No additional applications will be accepted.
 -- We were offered a venue for 40 people, but we decided to hold the first few sessions at Cybozu Labs, considering the risk of holding the first session in an unfamiliar location. Sorry to all of you who were expecting additional recruitment. Please look forward to the second and third sessions.
 
 - The presentation will be broadcast live in real time on Ustream and uploaded to Nico Nico Douga after the presentation.
 -- Please appeal in advance if you do not want to relay or upload videos.
 -- Thanks to coji for his efforts. Thanks.
 -- Reference: http://coji.s9.xrea.com/article.php?id=49
 
 - The purpose of this conference is not "just to participate and present" but "to present and make people aware of our presence and to provide an opportunity for subsequent communication.
 -- so please edit the Wiki (http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:members) and write your profile and blog URL.
 -- I think it is important to present what you have created as an ongoing thought on blogging, so if you don't have a blog yet, I encourage you to take this opportunity to create one.
 
 - In the meantime, we have created a chat room on Lingr for chatting and discussion.
 -- http://www.lingr.com/room/1000speakers
 -- The password is 1000speakers. If you leave it without a password, people who don't speak English may come in thinking there are lots of people...
 
 *1199378202* starting tomorrow
 Might be IP unreachable for a couple of days.
 So I typed in advance what I was going to write on the 8th.
 
 *1199385918*LIAR GAME
 I enjoyed it so much that I ended up watching it until this late, but I'm not satisfied with the way it ended.
 
 Ah, it's that time already.
