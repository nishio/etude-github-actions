 *1278841156* Talk about buying Porco Rosso, etc.
 A real-life example of shopping from amazon.co.uk, the second (the first is <a href='http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nishiohirokazu/20090128/1233161373'>Amazon.co.uk says it's cheaper to buy DVDs from Amazon</a>)
 
 The other day, "Red Pig" was airing, and I couldn't see it even though my Twitter timeline was getting excited, so I got mad and bought "Cagliostro's Castle" which was next to "Red Pig" lol.

 I also bought a <a href='http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9F%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AB %E3%83%BB%E3%82%B4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89 %E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC'>I also bought a collection of Michel Gondry's</a> work. If you don't know Michel Gondry, you should definitely watch the video below. I've long wanted to see it in high resolution because I'm curious as to how he made such a video.

 If you buy it in Japan, it costs 4,800 yen. But if you buy it in the UK, it is cheaper.
 
 Now, it's time to get down to business. How much did it end up costing me? 22.85 pounds for the three items, or 3054 yen plus 6.56 pounds for shipping, or 877 yen.
 
 When I ordered on 7/5, I received an e-mail saying that the order would be shipped on 7/6 and would arrive on 7/26, but when I checked my mailbox yesterday, 7/10, it had already been mailed.

 Delivery estimate: 26 July 2010
 Dispatch estimate for these items: 6 July 2010

 Last time I ordered on January 28 and it arrived on February 4, so that's less than a week.
 
 And the DVD was easily viewable on my MacBook. Just like last time. It went so easily that I didn't have much to write about.
