Pride in having a product
There is a certain commodity X. There is a person A who cannot afford it and a person B who can. Among B, there is a person C who struggles to afford it and a person D who does not. Among person C, there is person E who is proud of having commodity X, and person F who is not.

E makes fun of A, and A gets angry at E, but since he doesn't have product X, he doesn't know the divisions within B and slams B as a whole together, causing D and F's displeasure and widening the gap between A and B.

D thinks E is ridiculous.
