 Company. Well, it's my day off, so I think I'll stay away from the keyboard.
 
 *1209438390* It's almost noon.
 I took a bath and cleaned the walls of the bathroom while thinking about where to go. Let's see if the National Science Museum in Ueno is crowded. Darwin exhibition. If it looks like it will be crowded to the point of exhaustion, I'll go to Ueno Park to unwind.

 When I send an email to Hatena from my cell phone, I get an error message back, so I thought maybe I wasn't sending the photo, but it's working.
 The Darwin exhibition was interesting. Darwin was 22 years old when he set out on his round-the-world trip. Darwin was not the first to mention the possibility of organisms evolving; his grandfather <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A9%E3%82%BA%E3%83%9E%E3% 82%B9%E3%83%BB%E3%%83%80 83%80%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3">Ellamas Darwin</a> even published it. It was mainly a philosophical reflection and not based on observational facts, apparently. His wife and mother are <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%83%83%E3%82%B8%E3% 82%A6%E3%83%83%E3%83%89">Wedgewood</a> family, famous for their tableware.
