 Six Stages of Learning and Six Stages of Science

[50 Great Books of World Philosophy].
 There is no clear structure between the 50 items, so you can read from wherever you like.
 Some of them I knew, and some I was hearing for the first time.
 I felt that the book itself was merely the table of contents portion of a "philosophy" that is 10-100 times the volume of this book.
 Even though it may seem inefficient at first glance, I think it is better to take the time to learn the core and then put some meat on the table.
