 After a week, I suddenly remembered that I had accessed the site to see if the number of problems had increased and found that I had dropped to 270th place. So, the total number of users is more than 20,000, but not more than 300 people have passed me by solving the four newest problems while I was not solving them. I guess there are fewer active users than I thought. And when I solved the newest problem, I ranked 20th. I guess there are only about 20 people who solve problems as much as I do.
