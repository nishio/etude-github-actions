I'll make sure my future self knows.
I used to think that "making sure you know your future self" was an essential action for intellectual production, but then I realized that some people surprisingly don't think so, so I thought about why I think this is an essential action.

　[Future self is a stranger]
　The ideal is to "write in a way that others can understand."
　　But it's unclear what knowledge others have, so doing it in earnest would be like writing an entire textbook, and that's high cost.
　So "write so your future self can understand."
　　Assume yourself one year from now like this
　　　I've forgotten what I know now, like I knew six months ago.
　　　I know what I know now, like I've known for two years.
　　Some sort of persona.
　　Specific examples as of 2021-09-04
　　　A year from now, I know Python, I don't know Cypress, I can play Micra, I don't know much about Redstone circuits.

　What happens if we don't do this?
　　A text whose comprehension cost is higher than a certain level will not be read unless you believe it is worth it.
　　In other words, the products of intellectual production return to dust.
　　Decreasing in value over time.
　　　Many things do.
　　　[0→1].
　　　　The "1" line is the one I can read and understand years later.
　　　　　Even this is quite a task.
　　　　　It's not something you can get on your own without doing it consciously.
　　　　So I'll loosen the conditions and make it "for me" and "one year from now."

　具体例
　　Programs that did not write comments become unmaintainable after one year.
