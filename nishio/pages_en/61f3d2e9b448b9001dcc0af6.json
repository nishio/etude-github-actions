Not content with the applause of the masses
from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
Excessive applause from the masses never satisfies the sensible.

Common ground in the middle of nowhere.

First, it is not a hobby. O great and wise one, how can you not be at ease when your deeds please the crowd? The excessive applause of the masses never satisfies the sensible. Some become chameleons of popularity and find pleasure in the breath of the crowd, not in the sweet fragrance of Apollo. Second, it is not intelligence. For ignorance can never surpass wonder. While vulgar folly wonders, wisdom watches its tricks.
