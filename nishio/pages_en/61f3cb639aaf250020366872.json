Bad luck is the punishment for stupidity
Bad luck is the punishment for stupidity, a contagious disease spread among foolish people.
Those who do not have the wisdom to act when they should act are infected with "bad luck.
When in doubt, imitate the actions of the wise and prudent, sooner or later they will get strangely "lucky."

The story is related to what we now call [planned contingency].


from [The Art of Worldly Wisdom]
[choose good luck, avoid bad luck].
xxxi 

Bad luck is generally a punishment for stupidity, and no disease is more contagious to those who share it. Do not open the door for a small misfortune, for it will not be opened for you. For other great calamities will surely creep in afterwards. The greatest skill in cards is to know when to discard them. The smallest current trump is worth more than the ace of trumps in the last game. When in doubt, follow the suit of the wise and prudent. Sooner or later they will win the strangest of tricks, for they are the best of the best, and the best of the best.
