brandish science
When we call a person who "pushes his/her personal ideas as absolutely correct" a "person who wields X," we call him a "person who wields science" only because his "personal ideas" are sprinkled with scientific terms, which leads to the compatibility error "personal ideas = science. For example, "waving pseudoscience" would not be an error.
That it is appropriate to call claims that only use science-like words "original theory" or "pseudoscience" instead of calling them "science".
The reason why "personal ideas" and "science" are compatibility errors is because science is a collection of "disprovable ideas that many people have tried to disprove and no one has been able to disprove yet.
