(5.2.5.1-2) Not "related pieces" but "pieces likely to be related"
I explained the concept in [(5.1.1.5) Do not mind duplication] and [(Column) You may find a relationship later]. However, I explain it again because it is important.

The phrase "pieces likely to be related" is intentionally used in a different sense from "related pieces."

When organizing groups, we sometimes feel that two pieces are somehow related. This feeling is exploring far ahead of your [rational thinking]. The feeling is strengthened or weakened by other pieces. As your feeling goes strong, your mind wants to [justify] that.

Much later than the feeling, you may find the reason why those pieces are related. It is the time when your [rational thinking] has reached what your feeling have found.

The [pattern discovery] is [subjective]. We have a faster ability to find patterns than rational thinking. We should make use of this ability.
