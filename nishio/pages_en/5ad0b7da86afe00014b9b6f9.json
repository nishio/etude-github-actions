KJ method with folders
2018-04-13
I saw an article showing how to do [kanban] using [paper folder] and tried to see if I could do [KJ method] with it.
ã€€Conclusion: Not good
 A3 is too small to do KJ method.
 	Three folders of sticky notes for one lecture.
 Well, but it has the advantage of being able to carry it safely, or open it and lay it out on the go.
	If you have to put a sticky note on the back of a notepad [Rhodia], a folder is much better than a sticky note on the back of a notepad [Rhodia].
 	If you put it on a Rhodia, it's just a bunch of Rhodia, plus it ruins the functionality of the Rhodia.
 Wife's advice
 	The first thing you should do is write an explanation on the tab.
  	Writing on both sides is good because it can be seen from either side
  	One of my bad habits is to unconsciously think about reusing folders.
			By writing a description on the tab and labeling it "Exclusive/Use-all", it becomes "A3 cardboard that can be written on" instead of just "something to put sticky notes in".

   It's easier to prepare and place an A4 sheet of paper than to start with this, but it seems possible to use them together.
