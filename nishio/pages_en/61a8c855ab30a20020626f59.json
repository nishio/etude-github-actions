Future beauty as a pleasant stimulus.
Note that something interesting chemical reaction may occur.

>X [developmental disability] can't read the air
>O Like the conflict between classical physics and quantum theory, both the brains of the typically developing and the developmentally disabled are excellent computational methods for predicting the world, but the developmentally disabled algorithms that do not employ [purposiveness] require high computational power (intelligence).
>This is how it works in the interdisciplinary, big picture.

>[cicada3301_kig https://twitter.com/cicada3301_kig/status/1466284388925116416]: Even the standardized development is "air-reading" if the intelligence is below a certain level, and the standardized development that can function as an approximation even with low intelligence is the problem. The problem lies in the fact that humans, as a life form, have not adopted a strategy to further increase intelligence in a cost-effective manner, which is why we are in such a bad situation.

I don't feel like civilization will grow if I make the human race into a schizoid-leaning ASD bunch with an average IQ of about 150. Maybe they are passive and only do what they need to do. I think it would be better to instill some kind of nerdy common creative hobby as a pleasurable stimulus instinct.

I wonder what the aliens in "The Message", who evolved with a developmentally disordered strategy, came to earth to become civilized... but I see, "the beauty of the pattern seen in the future" should be a pleasant stimulus.
>We've come this far by stimulating the "current [gossip]" with pleasure.

>[cicada3301_kig https://twitter.com/cicada3301_kig/status/1466288866839519237]: so you can teach smart developmentally disabled people the beauty of future vision and they'll adapt to society, I see, that's certainly intuitive.

>[cicada3301_kig https://twitter.com/cicada3301_kig/status/1466289704576319489]: on the contrary, depression with typical development is really only "current gossip" as a pleasant stimulus!
>But for all that, regret and uncertainty about the future comes to the forefront, but that's not using an algorithm optimized for future vision like a developmental disorder in the first place, so if you don't let them do mindfulness, they're going to bug you frequently.

　I don't think the label "developmentally disabled" is quite resolving enough.
	[future vision].
	　Likely related to expressions such as [future person], [I'm from the future], [I live a little in the future], etc.
	[The Beauty of Futuristic Vision]
	[Message(sf)]
　Confrontational concept [gossip as a pleasant stimulus].
　relevance
　　[Great people talk about ideas.]
			>Dick people talk about other people.
			This is the equivalent of "current gossip is a pleasant stimulus."
