Issue with simultaneous one-finger drawing during two-finger gestures
OLD TITLE: Mouse drawing occurs at the same time, causing strange lines

solution
	Even if I do preventDefault in the touchstart handler, onMouseDown on the Tool side of Paper.js is called.
	The reason for this is that Paper.js grabs touchStart and relays it to mouseDown for touch-enabled devices in the first place: [src https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/blob/cc135eaba 80943f78075f84ca430dc3152bd154e/src/view/View.js#L1078]
	So, what needs to be fixed is the handler side that I passed to Tool for drawing.
		onMouseDown created a path object, but delayed it.
		Check raw event object with onMouseDrag
			If it is a touchmove and touches.length > 1, do nothing and return
â†’ Fixed!

	Why is a mouse event being fired when I'm preventDefaulting at the start of multi-touch?

	I see, since the handler for the tap is attached to the window, the one on the canvas is called first by default.
	Is it right to capture and stopPropagation?

 stopPropagation does not change the behavior.
 When I put useCapture on, contrary to expectations, only the draw occurs and the two-finger gesture doesn't work.
