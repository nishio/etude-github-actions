Priority and Subordination
[https://gyazo.com/ae90ec8982502d0a2fd132bb2183cf36]

　(1) Often implicitly assumes that "what should have the highest priority" is determined by one
　(2) but that assumption is incorrect. There could be multiple ones A and B of equal priority.
　　It is not useful to spend time deciding whether A or B should take precedence in this case
　　Since both bring equal value, it doesn't make much difference which comes first.
　　Just toss a coin to decide.
　　When time is short and something has to be cut down itself, C is cut down.
　　　In other words, information needed in a time-strapped situation is not a [priority], but a [subordinate].
