The world has been torn apart many times.
[After the World is Torn Apart] continued

In response to "[After the world is torn apart]," I used the prompt "Abstract the following sentence, assign an alphabetical letter to the concept, and briefly itemize the relationships between the concepts" to "[Suggest an analogy for a structure similar to this composition]."

Human Interpretation
　In other words, this "world tearing phenomenon" has a structure similar to the following
　　When [urbanization] occurs with economic development, there is a disparity between rural and urban areas.
　　Changes in the natural environment are causing [native species] to decline.
　I was upset when I saw "Tears in the World," but now I'm starting to feel that this kind of thing has been repeated many times before.
　　[Knowledge is the antidote to fear.]
