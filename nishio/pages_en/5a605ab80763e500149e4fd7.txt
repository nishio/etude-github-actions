People who teach innovative thinking.
 For any given X, it is difficult for "someone who does not understand X" to determine whether what "someone who teaches X" is teaching is good or bad.
 If the person teaching programming had no programming experience, I would be rather suspicious.
 Similarly, we want those who teach innovative thinking to have experience with innovative thinking.
 Telling people to use a specific tool with a specific procedure is dogmatic and does not fit in with innovative thinking.
 The belief that innovative ideas will fall into place when certain tools are used in certain procedures is a type of cargo cult.
