Keynes
[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]
 unemployment
 	If wages fall, demand increases and equilibrium is reached = unemployment disappears.
  In contrast to neoclassical economics, which says, "If the market is left to its own devices, an equilibrium solution will be reached in the long run.
  Keynes asserted, "In the long run, we are all going to die.

 [Liquidity preference theory
  Liquidity has value.
  I'd rather have it in cash than invest or consume it.

	demand for labor
 	Determined by the quantity of goods planned to be produced.
  	goods
   	consumer goods
    investment asset
  Demand for labor declines during recessions.
		Comparing the rate of return on investment to the bank's rate of interest, a decrease in the rate of return on investment results in a significant decrease in the production of investment goods
		The more recessionary the economy, the more uncertainty about the future, the higher the liquidity preference.
  Walras: "The sum of excess demand for the various commodities is zero."
   Liquidity preference in the money market creates excess demand for money
   This causes "lack of labor demand = unemployment" in the labor market.
   Unselling occurs in the commodity market.
		Liquidity preference for individuals to rationally prepare for future uncertainty

	Raise liquidity to address this problem and lower the interest rate.
 	zero-interest-rate policy

	[nishio.icon]Investing in stocks doesn't hurt liquidity much because you can just sell them when you need them.
  Buying a house is such a huge loss of liquidity.

	The Birth of Keynesian Macroeconomics

 Samuelson's textbook "Economics" introduces [the IS-LM model], Hicks' interpretation of Keynes' arguments
 	[Cessation by Hicks]
 		Keynesian macroeconomics apply when underemployment occurs.
   Back to full employment, neoclassical microeconomics applies.
