　　[nishio.icon]Nishio's image of what happens within the recipient of a metaphorical symbol is this. There's no overlap between the "felt meaning" recongnized from the symbols presented as being related, so I'm trying to find the overlap through extended interpretation.
　　　Eugene Gendlin describes it as "the collation of the felt meaning evoked by the existing symbols to the mass of felt experience, and a new aspect of the mass emerges."
　　　(I digress from here.) Like an average?

  　　But the average would be only c.
  　　Rather, we can ignore the component of B in some axis y direction and put it in A, d, and so on.
  　　　It can be e depending on what you focus on and what you ignore.
  　　>For example, if you read a certain poem over and over again, you get different meanings.
  　　 This could be interpreted as an "unstable process," but Eugene Gendlin interprets it as "creative."
