 *1321077993* How does the box that the ring snaps open work?
 I was curious about how that "snapping" open box works, so I decided to take it apart and take a look. Of course, I got my wife's permission beforehand!
 
 Surprisingly simple.

 It only contains hinges and plate springs.

 The plate spring exerts force in the direction of bringing the two ends closer together. Since the part of the hinge that hooks the spring protrudes slightly forward, when the hinge is straight, the force of the plate spring acts in the direction of bending the hinge forward. In other words, when the lid is closed, the spring force is applied in the direction that keeps the lid closed.

 But the plate spring simply wants to bring its own two ends closer together. When the hinge is bent back a little, the line connecting the two ends of the spring is behind the fulcrum of the hinge, so the force of the spring's contraction now acts in the direction of opening the lid. So when you open it a little, it snaps open.
 
 Finally, the hinge stops at about 80 degrees open because the plate spring physically stops when it hits the hinge. The plate spring exerts a force in the direction to keep the lid open, so the lid stays open without wobbling.

 It's a simple structure, but well done.
