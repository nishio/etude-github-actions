Examples of tweet quotes
>[masanork https://twitter.com/masanork/status/1476142193132081154]: Especially when the posts on the keyboard are not publicly visible, and if, for example, a well-wisher recorded a meeting and posted it on Youtube, it would be a serious violation of privacy. If you record a meeting and post it on Youtube, for example, it would be a serious invasion of privacy. Should it be treated equally like a publication if it can be viewed by the entire world? I think the threshold of publication once implicitly provided an opportunity to become aware of our social responsibility.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1476162270778765312]: Since Article 18 of the Copyright Act states that "publication means presentation or offer to the public" and Article 2 states that "the public includes a specified number of persons" and the Agency for Cultural Affairs states that "50 persons are a large number" A keyboard post with more than 50 followers is a public announcement, and can be quoted and used (even in a public forum) according to Article 32.

Compared to deleted tweets, undeleted keystroke tweets seem to have a lower hurdle to clear quotation source clarification, but the issue of violation of Twitter's terms and conditions seems to remain.

>[masanork https://twitter.com/masanork/status/1476179579240919041]: Even if quoting itself is allowed, for example, capturing and exposing a tweet from a keyboardist, it may be a matter of dispute whether it is "consistent with fair practice and within the legitimate scope of reporting, criticism, research, or other purposes of quotation". For example, even if quotation itself is allowed, it may be a point of contention whether it is "consistent with fair practice and within the legitimate scope of reporting, criticism, research, or other purposes of quotation" if the tweet is captured and exposed. Especially since tweets are short in character.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1476198626066300929]: of course it is a prerequisite to meet the requirements of a citation, especially the subject-subject relationship, in order for it to qualify as a citation. I am talking about quotations, not about the act of "capturing and exposing key tweets".

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1476198863665250304]: what is the precedent here (continued) > in light of this ruling?

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1476199822403448832]: (continued) I think you mean the one in this series of tweets, which was not recognized as a citation in a case where the main part was clearly someone else's work This is a case where the main part of the work was clearly someone else's work.
	>[kenjisugiura01 https://twitter.com/kenjisugiura01/status/1475726741998284800?s=21]: In a case (Tokyo District Court, December 10, 2021, court website), a tweet that posted a scanned image of another person's tweet violated Twitter's terms of use and did not meet the requirements for citation under Article 32(1) of the Copyright Act. The court held that the tweeting of a scrubbed image of another person's tweet did not meet the requirements for quotation as stipulated in Article 32(1) of the Copyright Act because it violated Twitter's terms of use and was not in accordance with fair practice (Tokyo District Court, December 10, 2021, court website).

 >"Since it can be said that the screenshot image clearly constitutes the main part, both quantitatively and qualitatively, it cannot also be found that citing it is within the legitimate scope for the purpose of citation."

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1476202689835188224]: "A post under lock and key is not publicly available for public inspection" versus "It is published and can be quoted and used (if other citation requirements are met)." I meant to say that, but the character limit caused me to break off the parentheses, which was the source of the confusion.
