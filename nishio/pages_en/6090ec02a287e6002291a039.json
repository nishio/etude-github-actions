 **1258463271*[Kaizen] Empty can placement
 Previous: Empty cans are placed on top of the microwave (if they are left on the desk, etc., move them to the top of the microwave).
 Problem: Sometimes they fall out. When I try to get it out, it doesn't fit in the bag and crushes it.
 Kaizen: Empty cans are placed in a special box for cans equipped with a bag. Convenience store bags vary in size, so we purchased 20-liter bags.
 Outcome: When it's time to throw out the bag, just take it out, tuck it in, and take it with you! No more "I can't fit it in the bag when I want to take it out!
 
 *1258466344* New Twitter spam aimed at Japanese?
 - From people you don't normally exchange direct messages with.
 - I am a personalized letter that can be sent to an unspecified number of people and does not contain personalized information.
 - It has a URL and tries to get you to click on it.
 I received a direct message on November 9 that reeked of spam, but since the text was in Japanese and it was the only message I received, I thought it might be spam, but I kept an eye on it. Today, I received a message with the exact same text, and I was convinced that it was spam. So I decided to alert people on my blog.

 I don't check what's on the links or what mechanism is used to send messages because it's too much trouble, but please be aware that carelessly clicking the Allow button or other buttons can be a part of the spamming process. Twitter should install a spam filter as soon as possible!
