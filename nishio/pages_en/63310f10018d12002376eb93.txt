People who think of software and hardware in terms of an oppositional structure.

	>It is great to use Tangible things to attract children's interest. However, it is also true that it is difficult to learn several things at once. In the case of machine building and robotics, the main focus is on understanding and creating machines and robots. That is fine, but it is also good to provide a separate opportunity to experience the real excitement of software.
	>Programming is also necessary for robot control, but it is conventional control engineering and only part of the current software possibilities. Of course, complex programming is necessary to make the robot perform elaborate actions, but as mentioned earlier, just assembling and moving the robot is difficult.
	>I would like to see a mechanism that allows students to start with a robot, but beyond that, I would like to see a mechanism that provides them with opportunities to develop an interest in programming and enhance their abilities.

>The world is connected, and you can provide value to people all over the world, even from your own room. Even the smallest thing can have an impact around the world.
>The story is that software has that kind of potential.

>Nowadays, manufacturing is easier than it used to be. 1 million yen is enough to make a great mock-up of a product. A few tens of thousands of yen is enough to make a usable product.
>I think if I were to teach now, it would be prototyping. Make what you want yourself. Seek opportunities for presentations and feedback.
>I think the boundaries of software and hardware have already been crossed.

>To do a lot of fine loops of such challenges and feedback, and then to draw up big ideals and strategies.
>I always hope that the child will grow up with a world-scale imagination and small accumulation of imagination.

Difference between those who see software and hardware in oppositional composition and those who do not.
