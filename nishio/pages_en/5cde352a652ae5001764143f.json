>As a recruiter, it is nothing but a waste of time to spend time on people who have turned down a job offer, so don't tell the hiring manager not to call them just for the sake of [courtesy], even if you want them to change their mind. Who's the one giving shitty advice that lowers Japan's [productivity]?

I thought this was a discrepancy between "courtesy 1.0," which considers it polite to use one's own time, and "courtesy 2.0," which considers it polite not to take away [the other's time].
