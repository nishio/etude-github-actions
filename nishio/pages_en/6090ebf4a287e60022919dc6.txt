 *1200186360*SimCity and Python
 Slashdot Japan | Source Code for the First SimCity Released
 http://slashdot.jp/developers/08/01/13/0045253.shtml
 >>
 The released sources are a Tcl/Tk version that runs on Unix and OLPC, and a source that is being ported to a Python module based on the Tcl/Tk version.
 <<
 
 Wow. So I'll be able to tinker with what's inside?
 I wonder if there will be a rash of SimCity-like games in the future that reference the Python version of SimCity.
 Civilization and others have Python consoles attached to them, and many other interesting things.

 That's hilarious!
 
 *1200194380*50 English
 I bought last year <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4478980551?ie=UTF8&tag=nishiohirokaz-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=1211& creativeASIN=4478980551">50 English</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.jp/e/ir?t=nishiohirokaz-22&l=as2&o=9&a=4478980551" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />I actually felt forced by the example sentences and the mysterious picture, so I neglected it. I was so impressed at the beginning of the year that I pulled it out to try to memorize this one too. I'm not going to be so gullible as to criticize without doing it.
 
 And when I read it, I found that this was a surprisingly well thought out book. I've been asked to memorize English examples in high school and many other things, but can I write even one of them right here and now? It is meaningless to memorize something temporarily but not to be able to recall it after a while. It is meaningless unless we increase the number of "tools in a usable state" that can be recalled anytime and anywhere. On the other hand, if you have a few things that you can recall at any time, you can recall them while waiting for the train at the station or in the elevator to strengthen your memory.
 In order to memorize the 50 example sentences, including their order, a mysterious picture and an impossible story are provided as a memory technique. I thought it was a mysterious picture, but surprisingly, it was easily memorized. The story is also a rather impossible story, but I was able to memorize it surprisingly well. After all, I was able to memorize the first 10 sentences yesterday while walking around the city. When I arrived home, I dictated the sentences and was able to write all of them with only one mistake in "this" and "that. I think I can memorize 50 sentences in a week.
 Once you have memorized 50 example sentences, you are now supposed to memorize conversational sentences based on those example sentences and other slightly different variations. And when you have finished all of them, you will watch the movie "You've got mail" and practice to be able to listen without looking at the screen. I thought it was great that the tasks were broken down into small pieces so that you don't fall behind on the way to that point.
 
 Making a picture out of a complication" or "making up a story" are common techniques in the art of memory, but I don't know how to actually make one up. I thought this book, which goes as far as creating those complications, would be a good reference as an example of memory practice in addition to English study.
 
 *1200203755*Written at Cafe Lenoir
 - I forgot my muffled headphones. It's too loud.
 - The seat is close to the window and still bright, so the light from the side is not kind to my eyes.
 - Bought solder. less than 100 yen. You couldn't make an infrared pen at the end of the year because you didn't have this.
 
 **1200204577* Semi-submerged data center

 I'd like to see a semi-submerged beach anyway, and an everlasting summer beach with heat dissipation on top of it. Improve the health of the geeks and the chance to meet people!

 And I didn't swim in the pool, but coded in the footbath (with table, power supply, and wifi) using the heat radiation.
 
 *1200212132*About the Venue for a 1000 Speaker Conference, etc.
 We are grateful for the various venues we have been offered. In the future, we would like to hold our meetings in various locations to promote interaction and make everyone happy, but for now, we would like to hold the first few meetings in our home ground until we get used to running the event.
 
 In the future, it would be nice to be able to hold such events in Osaka, Fukuoka, or Sapporo, but I think it would be a mess if we were to create chapters too hastily, so I would like to wait until we get settled and get into a comfortable pace.
 
 I thought it would be better to put the information on a wiki rather than keeping it in my brain or in my comments on the comments section of the "What's the best way to use the conference room at Knocking On? I thought it would be better to put them in a wiki rather than keeping them in my brain or in my comments on the "hatebu" site, so I created the page below. It's still not complete yet, but I'd be glad if you could add any information you have.

 Other things that were discussed in Lingr, so I'll give a light summary.
 - The letters are sized so that 18 point is barely visible in the relay. If it is too small, it is difficult to see on site.
 - It was difficult to make a timetable this time because we were not told in advance the time of the presentations, but we made a tentative one.
 -- http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:1
 -- Briefly, "15 minutes total for presentation and Q&A", "breaks & chatting time every hour", and "time gaps are absorbed during breaks".
 - A Ustream channel has been created.
 -- http://ustream.tv/channel/1000speakers
 -- The conference will be broadcast live here.
 
 **1200213530*Jython book manuscript
 I am the one who compiles information on video distribution, etc. without writing ...
 http://ja.doukaku.org/wiki/index.php/1000speakers:howto_distribute_movies
 
 I guess I lost my cool and went to Lingr.
 
 **1200213878*1000 speaker conference name tags
 Since I don't think we will be able to gather people if we start asking people what they would like to put on their nametags now, how about preparing a piece of paper the size of a business card, a nametag case, and a marker and asking people to draw what they would like to draw? It would be much better than having no nametag.
 
 *1200214810* headache
 Cold feet. Hot face. The temperature is different on the left and right sides of my earlobe. Ugh, will I catch a cold if I continue to work too hard? Should I give up? My eyes hurt, too. It's no good. I can't work. I haven't made any progress on the manuscript after all.
 
 Is it still the right thing to do, or is it the right thing to "try tomorrow"? The latter feels like the right answer, but I'm wondering if it's the same line as escape. I wonder where is escapism and where is correct task management.
 
 *1200233537* I got an infrared pen!
 Oh, the photo turned out to be "one of the day". Oh well.
 Terra aerial wiring.

 Hold it like this. There is a switch between the thumb and middle finger.
 I wonder if I could hold my index finger behind the LED and trace the screen with my index fingernail. If that doesn't work, I could try to press the switch with my index finger and thumb.
 
 *1200235471* Hatena Star
 I wonder if I can see the list of stars I have added somewhere.
 It would be even better if it could also take the string that was selected when it was attached.
 I want API.
