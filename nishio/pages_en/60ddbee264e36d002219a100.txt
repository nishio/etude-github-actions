Fear of being lost
[Why publish a personal project?]
　I realized I had a strong fear of losing them.
 　This page was written in Scrapbox with voice input to write down what I was thinking while I was suffering from eyestrain and headache so bad that I put a warmer on my eyes to deprive me of vision, and I suddenly realized, "Why am I writing in Scrapbox all this way?" and then I realized
 　So this page itself is the first edition with voice input

If you don't record your thoughts, they'll just keep disappearing.
　Fear of losing something of value makes us record our thoughts.
　Why publish your thoughts?
　　For if it is not made public, it is lost with death

[Humans are just fragile parts that will only operate for a hundred years or so.
　Information not output from the part during normal operation will disappear.
　Personal memory is just a cache for faster access, it disappears when the power is turned off.
　The same feeling of pressing Ctrl+S on the blistering feeling that if you write a long sentence without saving it to a file, it might disappear and make your thoughts public.
