To be an understanding person.
The other day in [Propagation of New Concepts], I illustrated what happens around the originators of new concepts. In this article, we will consider what will happen in the future to make the people who are called "consciousness raisers" of this new concept happy.

The previous figure focused on the flow of information, where concepts are propagated.

This is what happens when you draw "likes and dislikes" between these characters.

	Those in "heightened awareness" must like the caller.
		So I believe what the caller said, "It's a C," is correct without any evidence.
	Unfortunately, this attitude of theirs contributes to more "haters of the sender."
	Callers don't like people with "heightened awareness"
	The caller likes people who "understand" or "develop arguments."

	People with "heightened awareness" need to change their mindset in order to be liked by their favorite "callers."
	The attitude of believing the sender's statements without evidence increases the sender's enemies.
	We need to learn what supports the caller's words and be able to understand them with evidence.
	Not, "It's a C because the caller said it was a C," but "Why is it a C?" Dig deeper.
	It's good practice to [explain to others].
		Others will ask, "Why B?" would ask.
		I'm going to dig in and say, "A, therefore B."
		Dig down to the point where you're satisfied.
		A good touchstone to see if others agree.
		The experience of "being able to convince others why the caller said C" is a measure of your progress in understanding

	How to go from "understanding" to "developmental discussion" is another story.
		Learning is not enough.
		The ability to create a new box called "D" is acquired by thinking for yourself and creating something new
		It is difficult to explain in a few pages, and my book [The Intellectual Production of Engineers] explains it
