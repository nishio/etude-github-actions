		I see... 3 to 5 pieces is fine.
		I've made 3 of them, but I can't seem to decide on the KR that corresponds to the 3rd O, which is the lowest priority.
		→ we shouldn't have two objectives mixed up in the third O. Let's split this up into three and four.
		→ I'm down to four, but the burden of three and four isn't too heavy, so I think I'll be fine.
		→(Half a day has passed)
		→ Huh? Aren't 3 and 4, which set "unburdened KR" in the first place, unimportant?
		→I've removed the first quarter O, and the second quarter O, and the third quarter O, and the fourth quarter O, and the fourth quarter O, and the fourth quarter O, and the fourth quarter O, and so on.
		→ resulting in a "narrow it down to one" situation.

impressions
	Probably a psychological hurdle to try to make just one from the start.
	Maybe 3-5 OKR's in the form of OKR's and then look back at them after a while and notice the ones you don't want.
