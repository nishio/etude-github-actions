For last month [November 2020 Muscle Training].

　My wife bought an exercise band.

　　I have a wobbly torso to begin with, and abdominal training often makes my back hurt, so I'm not ready to take on the load.
　　The problem is that they don't distinguish between "contracting the abdominal muscles" and "deflecting the waist," "thrusting the neck forward," etc.
　　The habit of thrusting the neck forward is often described in abdominal training as "looking at the navel" because
　　　If you try to look at the navel while not using your abdominal muscles properly, you will end up bending your neck too hard.
　　　Focus on "touching knees" and "exhaling" with hips and knees bent at 90 degrees
　　　　If there's room in that goal position, just look at the navel.
　　Don't move it fast and use recoil.
　　Hands should not be below the waist in the starting position

 Supported squat 120
  I guess I lost a lot of strength while I was slacking off, or maybe it was just too hard to do 120 times.
