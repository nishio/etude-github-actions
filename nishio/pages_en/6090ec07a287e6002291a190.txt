 What is the difference between compensate and reimburse? The same thing, but with a "re-" in the word "repay". deemed is "considered".
 
 I read the paper diagonally and couldn't get it out of my head, so I had no choice but to translate it. 37 lines in 1 pomodoro. At any rate, there are 72 more lines in the chapter I am going to read, so I will be able to translate it in 2 more pomodoros. There are 4 word cards added in this process.
 
 Two more pomodoros were worked and nine word cards were added.
