 2 ** 14 == 16384
 14 * 13 * 12 == 364
 This is a good size to explore all
 　For all 14 methods of selecting chemicals, check all 364 rules up to a maximum of 364 to check "because it hasn't exploded" and "if it's a flash, what's the dangerous chemical?".
 WA by misunderstanding the problem conditions.
 　Not "the number of chemicals already mixed" at a touch of a button.
 　Nor is it "the number of rules in a state of flux."
 　The answer is the size of the set of "chemicals that have not yet been added to the set of rules for the touchy situation.
