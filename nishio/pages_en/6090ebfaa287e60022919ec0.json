 I went home. I took the last train, but I made a mistake at the transfer station and walked 30-40 minutes to get home. I'm tired. I'm tired.
 
 
 Halfway through the project, I thought about getting lazy and going to sleep around there, but then I realized that if I did that, I would not be able to make it to OSC tomorrow, which would cause me trouble.
 I knew I would not accept the presentation for a while.
