	Dr. Goldratt's Logical Thinking Process - Create the strongest company with [TOC]! #Japanese title changed
 Original title: Goldratt's Theory of Constraints - A Systems Approach to Continuous Improvement

 One of the few decent books that explains the specific methodology of [Theory of Constraints](TOC), but the title is odd.
 [Constraints] include [policy constraints] (= human-created constraints) as well as [physical constraints
	[Conflict Resolution Diagram] is a framework used especially for [resolving disagreements] among people.
 	Even if both parties are working toward the same ideal, different conclusions can be drawn due to [different ranges of observation
 	see [limited reasonableness].

	Understanding the Current Situation
 	status quo analysis tree
  Finding Constraints
  The fundamental concept of TOC is that it is important to find bottlenecks, rate-limiting steps, and improve them.
  In other words, we think it's important to find one "place to change."
 Create Ideas
 	Conflict Resolution Diagram
 	In many cases, there is some kind of conflict, and we're not working toward a resolution.
  I don't think it's necessarily a conflict between [nishio.icon]people.
  Resolve by clarifying the implicit hypothesis behind it.
