Slide carding
	Q: When I print and reconstruct past slides, I now print them at 25up and cut them myself.
  It's a pain to cut. Any suggestions on how to do it better?
 	Cutting plotter I can buy for 20,000-30,000 and cut with that?
  Is it easier to cut if I have a cutting machine?

	A: Once you're ready to disregard cost, you can use business card printing sheets that have already been cut.
 	I checked the cost: [https://www.biccamera.com/bc/item/1743098/ 120 sheets, 227 yen] less than 2 yen per sheet.
  Each lecture is 60-90 slides, so it costs a mere 200 yen. Isn't that possible?
  You may accumulate slides for the Hall of Fame in a business card holder-like object. Look at it when you give a new talk.
  You can mix cards from multiple slides by adding a header indicating which slide they came from only when printed.
  	but you can find it if you search by content, so I don't see the need to distinguish between the two.
  [Business card paper]

	I actually made it.
 	When I tried printing a slide on a business card on my home printer, the slide height, which was supposed to be 55mm, was off by about 1mm in the end, so I divided by 5 to get 54.8 and managed to make it work. (Even if it were to happen that the A4 vertical printout would stretch by about 1mm, it is unlikely to be noticed in a normal use case.)
  The third time was so-so (the balance between the left and right sides is off and the bottom is still a little cut off).

		If the top and bottom are just about right, the text at the edges may be cut off due to printing accuracy problems, so it is better to leave a margin of about 1 mm.
  There is room on both sides, but this should be pulled to one side or the other.
		Wrong direction to point for manual feed printing
  	The company printer was to insert the paper from the long side, not "insert from here" as written on the paper.
   The printed side should be on top, with the top of the paper facing forward.
