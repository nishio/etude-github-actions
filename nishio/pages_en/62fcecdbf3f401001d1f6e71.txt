　The logic is that Cleverine gel produces chlorine dioxide, chlorine dioxide inhibits the action of viruses, and therefore it is useful to have Cleverine gel in the room.
　In reality
　　Chlorine dioxide at "1.5 ppm" inhibits viral action.
　　Cleverine gel produces "less than 0.03 ppm" chlorine dioxide.
