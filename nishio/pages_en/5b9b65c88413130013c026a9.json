Thompson sampling
[Theory and Algorithms for Bandit Problems] p.38 [Thompson Extraction]
	Bayesian estimation] of expected value
	Choose the action with the probability of being the maximum expected value of each action ([probability matching method])
 However, instead of doing this "probability of being the maximum expected value" calculation, use the [random choice algorithm
 Since it is Bayesian, a distribution of expected values is obtained. Sampling from this distribution
 Select the action that had the largest value as a result of sampling
 This will make it possible to "choose that action with the probability of being the maximum expected value.
