Motivation System2013-09-01Facebook
from [motivation system].
	The total number of users of my "[motivational system]" exceeded 5,000, and I calculated that 40.0% of them said they were motivated by this system. But in the beginning, 52% or so were satisfied with the system, so that's a significant drop. Why did satisfaction drop when the system was not changed?
	The most promising hypothesis right now is that there may be a difference in satisfaction between someone who was searching for a solution by searching for "lack of motivation" and someone who was looking at a news site with miscellaneous topics without motivation and came from a link written there...
	To verify this, we would have to take referrers from where they came from and see if there is a difference between those who came via search and those who came via news sites, but I'm not too happy if that is revealed.

 The technical peculiarity of the motivational system is that it does not have its own server. We record every user activity for later analysis, but everything is plugged into Google Analytics.

	When I asked the motivation system why I thought I was going to improve my motivation system but lost it just by writing a blog, it said, "Isn't it unclear what exactly constitutes completion of an improvement?" I was told, "Isn't it unclear what exactly constitutes completion?
 I don't know what I want to do, I don't know what I want to do. So 2,000 people were saved while we left it alone for six months to try to improve it, so maybe we should leave it alone for another six months.
 Oh, but I like the idea of adding questions and answers about some of the ones that went to free writing.
