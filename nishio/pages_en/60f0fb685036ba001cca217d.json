Don't try to sleep, keep your eyes warm.
When I'm concentrating on programming or other work and it's 26-28 o'clock, I sometimes find myself in a state where I think I should go to bed, but I'm not sleepy.

I recently found that I sleep with "warm eyes, not trying to sleep".
	I tweeted about it, and some people seemed interested, so I wrote a little more about it.

I use a cloth bag with red beans in it to warm my eyes, microwave it and put it on my eyes.

　I bought this when I visited Kobe Nunobiki Herb Garden about 7 years ago. At that time it smelled like lavender, but now it smells only like azuki beans!
　　There's no particular reason why it has to be this way.
　　And maybe this one for neck and shoulders.
　　　I don't set the time, so it gets too hot to put on my eyes, so I warm my neck or something for a while and then put it on my eyes.
　I'm wondering if this is similar for people who want to buy something similar online.

Put it on your eyes until it's no longer warm.
　If you were still awake when it was no longer warm, I would interpret that as "no need to sleep."
　　So you can get up and keep working.
　　In that case, I would interpret it as "warming up my eyes and getting rid of fatigue."
　The feeling of "I need to sleep" prevents me from falling asleep.
　　It's like, "I don't care if I sleep or not, but I'm pretty sure my eyes are tired anyway, so let's warm them up."
　　In fact, a high percentage of them fall asleep.
