affine space
Addition over a set of numbers, or vector addition over [vector space], is closed, but "add 2:00 and 3:00" over a set of times is wrong. If we say, "Three hours after 2:00 is 5:00," then we have two different sets of values for "time" and "hour."

An affine space is a pair of a set A (in this case the set of "times") and a certain [vector space]V (in this case the set of "times").
