Close browser tabs
	Tends to have a large number of browser tabs
 [I'm not good at cleaning up.]
	What is the purpose of having browser tabs open?
 Temporary storage of information and other items of interest
 If it's the very tab you're using to work on right now, that's fine.
 Tabs that have been left unattended for a time
 	It's just a [waste] of space on the screen.
 The title of the tab alone is not much [information].
	 More tabs further reduce the amount of information.
 Then just post it to Scrapbox and close it.
	Fight the desire to keep it where you can see it.
