Get used to your family's shortcomings.

Get used to your familia failures.

Just as you get used to ugly faces, you must get used to your family's flaws. It is essential that they depend on us or we depend on them. There are miserable characters that one cannot live with or without them. So a wise person gets used to them, just as one gets used to ugly faces. At first they evoke disgust, but gradually they lose their influence, and introspection either prepares or tolerates disgust.
