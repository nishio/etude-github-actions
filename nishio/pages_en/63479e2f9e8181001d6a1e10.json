Invention of the camera
>In 1826, the French Niepce brothers improved the camera obscura and used asphalt, a material used for road construction, as the photosensitive material, and took approximately eight hours to take a single photograph. Later, in 1839, Louis Daguerre of France introduced the "daguerreotype" technique, which used a silver-plated copper plate as the photosensitive material. This reduced the exposure time to about 30 minutes.
