(1.2.3) Should I go to university?
Many reader asked me whether it is better to go to university to obtain systematic knowledge. Let me tell you about this a bit.

First of all, "to get systematic knowledge" is the bad pattern of [unknown achievement condition]. The meaning of "systematic" is unclear.

There seems to be some misunderstanding that they can get the secret knowledge by going university, and you can not get the secret elsewhere. However, the university is not the place to give you secrets. The university is to do the research. The research is an activity to create new knowledge which is not yet in the world. Information in textbooks and what you can learn from others are all knowledge already in the world.

There are merits that the detailed teacher chooses a reference book or issues a task. However, the university is a place to learn by yourself actively. If you want someone to teach you something in the university, you do not get much in the university.
