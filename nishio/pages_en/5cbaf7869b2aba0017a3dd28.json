>In today's chat, we discussed the possibility that there are two types of "centralized organizations. In other words, the traditional [pyramid organization], which is [controlled] by the center, and the [campfire organization], in which the center sets forth a [vision] and people interested in it gather loosely, both look [centralized] in terms of "[having] strong leaders," but there may be a big difference in substance. I wonder if there isn't.

This protocol was not established by the consensus of individual nodes, but rather by an entity that established it in advance, and entities that agreed with the protocol joined the network using that protocol.
