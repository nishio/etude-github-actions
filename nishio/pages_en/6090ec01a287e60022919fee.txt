 This is probably still a rare case now, but in another 20 years, there will come a time when the parents' generation will think that their children will naturally be active on the Internet. As long as they think that, they will naturally want to know what they are writing about.
 
 I wonder how communication will change in such an age. What if my every move, every Twit, every Reblog is now exposed to my parents?

 id:sakuragaoka Why do you think it will be 20 years? I mean, what about the generation born around 1991?

 That's roughly how old the children born when I was the age my father was when I was born will be when they are the same age as the 91st generation today.
