 *1311215412*How to merge back together a broken up sound on a Mac.
 >>
 What's the easiest way to undo (NFC) a Mac that's been broken up (NFD) like "shi&#12441;aha&#12442;n"? I've found a way to undo it and use it when I paste it into a terminal, but it's not the easiest way to do it.
 <<
 I'm talking about pasting it into the terminal, selecting the combined view and copying it again. I wanted to do something about it because it's a pain in the ass to do the selection and such.
 
 I didn't get any replies, so I had no choice but to write this one myself.
 >|python|
 import unicodedata
 import subprocess
 
 while True:
     d = unicode(raw_input(">>> "),  "utf-8")
     print repr(d), d
     d = unicodedata.normalize("NFC", d)
     print repr(d), d
     p = subprocess.Popen("pbcopy", stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
     p.communicate(d.encode("utf-8"))

 and that it was returned correctly. I really thought it would be nice to be able to monitor the clipboard and convert automatically or something, but oh well.
