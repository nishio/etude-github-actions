Examples of choosing not to act due to fear of failure
Interesting story, so I'll summarize it and sort it out later.

 [A story about a child living in a world line where "only the right answers are allowed" will have trouble going straight into society - Togetter https://togetter.com/li/1180814]
 	When I gave the five new graduates a written procedure and observed how they solved the problem, they stared into the void, thought and argued repeatedly, and eventually had to stop the training project after 45 minutes of not starting work.
  He acted that way because he thought he couldn't go if he made a mistake early in his new career. (Not understanding that that in itself is a big failure.)
  Some of the new graduates have improved their behavior, but they say some have been kicked out for not improving and not making progress.
 [nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/941109383282298880] I wonder if the main cause of this kind of phenomenon is not the size or age of the company, but "the belief that failure is unacceptable" when the behavior of new graduates is consequently similar to the big company disease or old executives. I wonder if the main cause of this kind of phenomenon is not the size or age of the company, but "the belief that failure is unforgivable".

 	>I have a short temper, so I tell them my intention from the beginning and don't wait patiently for their response. I don't wait patiently for the other person's response because whether he/she grows up or not is their problem and I am not interested in that.
		>I understand that as a company we have a mission to train junior staff and subordinates, but after the first few minutes, if we can't get away with leaving it to their own initiative, it would be faster to force them to do it. I don't see the point in leaving it to autonomy.
  >When I think about it, I usually say, "[A company is not a school]," when we talk about this kind of thing in the company. In a school, the students are paying customers, so I respect their autonomy, but in a company, the company is paying the students, so I don't care about their autonomy.
		Company is not a school" is an important point.
  On the other hand, there are long-term disadvantages to not giving them the opportunity to independently [define their work].

  	>I have a feeling the way to learn the skills to define your own work is not to "leave it to autonomy".
   >There are many situations in which we make decisions about work (or other tasks in life) that we want to do, that we are required to do, that we should do, or that we are compelled to do, but they are often lumped together and treated as one. The truth is that they all have different motivations.

  In other words, "The company is not a school. If they had been told in advance that "it would be a mistake to choose 'no action' in this situation," they would have acted regardless of what their mentality was.
  [The demand for risk-taking varies depending on the line to be crossed] and is related to the following.
 		The line we have to cross is different from when we were students, and when we act as if things will stay the same, we are told that 'we'll never get out of the student mindset' or that 'the company is not a school.'"
   In reality, there are multiple lines. There may be a "pass/fail line," similar to that of a student, and a "competent/incompetent line," which is the line that determines whether special treatment and focused investment of resources should be made in management.
    The former is the decision line of "continue to invest resources or quit". The latter is the decision line of "to concentrate resources or not to concentrate resources.
		As we saw in [Environment where average orientation is the worst], in an environment where the majority of people receive rewards, it is a profitable strategy to stay close to the average, but in an environment where the minority of people receive rewards, it is a profitable strategy to stay away from the average. This is a very similar composition.

 	>I was watching a newcomer who was not progressing well in programming, and apparently he said, "I can't write a program if I don't know the correct answer to how to write it.
  >"There is no right answer, so you should think of your own answer and write it. If you can't write without a correct answer, you are nothing but a copy-and-paste programmer," but this has no effect and I am having trouble.
		Interesting similarities.
