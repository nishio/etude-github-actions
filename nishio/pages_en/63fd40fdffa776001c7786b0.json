I don't feel like teaching someone who makes fun of me.
Mr. A feels that X is valuable.
Mr. B makes a statement that lowers the value of X.
Suppose Mr. A realizes that Mr. B does not know one of the specific advantages of X, Y.
However, Mr. A often does not tell Mr. B about Y.

concrete example
　B "What games are you playing these days?"
　A "I'm playing Dominion."
　B "What? That old game?"
　A (I'm playing online multiplayer with a Steam version that was released a few months ago, in 2021, and with a new expansion that just recently came out, probably an image of the one released in 2008 paper).


(Surprisingly, I didn't write it down? I thought you would have written it, but I couldn't find it, so I wrote it.)
When I wrote it, I felt like I couldn't say "I don't feel like teaching."
　On the other hand, there's a pattern of desperately trying to teach goodness.
　　Maybe it's a case of Mr. A associating "having Mr. B evaluate the value of X" with his own evaluation.
　　In this case, they try to restore their unjustly undermined self-worth and explain that "this is what's good about me".
　　Well, they usually say "hmmm" and leave it unrestored.
