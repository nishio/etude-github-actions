 Thoughts.
  The issue of changing and deleting to make corresponding parentheses.
  Conversion and deletion costs are fixed for each character.
  N=3000
  There is no advantage in converting and then deleting, so there are three options: do nothing, convert, or delete.
 　If we set the parentheses as plamy 1 and the deletion as 0, we could make a DP with Y as the "sum up to the Xth".
 　　Corresponding parentheses are non-negative in the middle and zero at the end
 　　Values range from 0 to N
 　　N^2, so it's not too late.
