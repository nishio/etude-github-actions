Fortune and Fame
I doubt that the desire for fame springs from the best part of human beings. I am more comfortable with the idea that it is good [not to be offended when people don't know about you]. Well, I am convinced that the desire for fame creates greatness and monsters.
Do you have a different interpretation of the word "fame?" I am not looking for accolades from all people living today. It says so in "[Fame] is not a quantity, but a quality." Rather, it says [the wise man is immortal], so he must be thinking of timeless fame.

One is capricious, the other permanent. One opposes [envy], the other [oblivion]. Fortune is desired, sometimes helped, and fame is earned. The desire [for fame] springs from the best part of man. It was and still is the sister of the giant, the terrible monster or the brilliant genius, always the two extremes.
