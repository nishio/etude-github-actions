(4.4.2.2) Read to make a note
Let's see how to read the selected book.

First of all, [Akinori Takada] insists that you can follow the two principles:

	[Read when you want to read]
	[Read from where you want to read]

Those principles are related to [(1.3.1) Learn from what you want to know]. I explain the method of reading mathematical books later. Interestingly, the second principle contradicts the method for mathematical books. [Compare] them later.

Next, you prepare a note. You decide the whole amount first, for example, 10 pages per chapter, and you write chapter titles in the note. This activity is related to focusing on headings described in [(4.3.3) Attention to headlines] In this case, you hand-copy them rather than pay attention to them. Doing hand-copy is related to [Shakyo] activity described in [(1.3.4.1) Shakyo].

While reading through the book, you fill the note. There are tips as follows:

 [Record anything you do not understand].
 [Record words that appear many times].
 [Connect related concepts with lines].
 [Connect reasons and conclusions with arrows].

[Comparing] this with the [Whole Mind System]:

 "Record anything you do not understand" corresponds to "[❹ Make questions],"
 "Recording a word that appears many times" corresponds to "[find the keywords]" in [❷ Preview].

Connecting concepts is related to the [KJ method] in chapter 5.

Footnote:

	[Akinori Takada] recommends using a [pencil] to make it erasable. I think you should use your favorite stationery. However, inferior stationery that cannot connect a line may harm your intelligence.
