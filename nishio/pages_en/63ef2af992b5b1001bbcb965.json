Experiment with importing Scrapbox projects into Kozaneba
Tried to visualize and organize a graph of mention relations between pages in Scrapbox (99 elements and 400 links) using Kozaneba

personal experience
　It's obvious to the point where you can move something that is isolated or put something that is only connected to one thing beside it.
　From there, it suddenly becomes a conundrum.
　　Even I, who have many times KJ method experience with hundreds of cards, have difficulty in unraveling this 100-card hairball!
　I'll remove the chat page (8 pages) that is a huge hub from the link.
　　→The fact that it's a large network of people who are connected to each other even when they are removed from the network doesn't change the fact that it's a large network.
　what should i do?

consideration
　I thought this was the opposite of the KJ method.
　The KJ method is the act of looking at the whole picture and adding links from no links
　These "hairballs unraveling at times" have too many links to see the whole picture.
　　Or, to be more precise, "it doesn't make a planar graph, so humans can't see over it."
　Maybe we need assistance in breaking the link?

Isn't it necessary to cut the link? Discussion with ChatGPT about this
　[ChatGPT and the discussion of the furball's unraveling].
　Isn't it necessary to break the link?
　Isn't it a mistake to try to visualize the whole thing in the first place?
　The proposal listed here would divide it into 9 pieces, but I don't think it would be very useful.

　Impressions after some time
　The original network is not adequate
