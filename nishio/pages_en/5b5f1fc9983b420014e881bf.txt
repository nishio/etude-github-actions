Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework
Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework
Proposal for [H-LAM/T] system (Human using Language, Artifacts, Methodology, in which he is Trained)

Maybe I can make explanatory slides for this paper, since I mention it so often in person.


 Artifacts—physical objects designed to provide for human comfort, for the manipulation of things or materials, and for the manipulation of symbols.
 Language—the way in which the individual parcels out the picture of his world into the concepts that his mind uses to model that world, and the symbols that he attaches to those concepts and uses in consciously manipulating the concepts ("thinking").
 Methodology—the methods, procedures, strategies, etc., with which an individual organizes his goal-centered (problem-solving) activity.
 Training—the conditioning needed by the human being to bring his skills in using Means 1, 2, and 3 to the point where they are operationally effective.

4. Concepts, Symbols, And A Hypothesis

[Neo-Whorf hypothesis] see [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis].
>We offer the following hypothesis, which is related to the Whorfian hypothesis: Both the language used by a culture, and the capability for effective intellectual activity are directly affected during their evolution by the means by which individuals control the external manipulation of symbols. (For identification, we will refer to this as the Neo-Whorfian hypothesis.)
