iPhone does not have a ring -> Solution!

	Now that the process is running much smoother, I'd like to ask, "How long does it take to edit a video? The original 6-minute video is saved at 21:25, and the edited video is saved at 21:48, so 23 minutes including file copying and everything else.
	I published the video and put it on Facebook at 21:58.
	This video was made to observe how many search impressions there would be if we published a video with "iPhone 11 Pro Max" in the description.
	Also, I was struggling with this problem myself just the other day, so I hope it helps someone else.
