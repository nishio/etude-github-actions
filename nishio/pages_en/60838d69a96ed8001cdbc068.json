>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385604142962405379]: I was thinking of writing a lot of feedback this year, but I'd rather not even bother to write feedback, like a review memo that's one line "not specific". I'm not sure if I should be thinking about how to improve the proposals that I do >>Proposal Enhancement

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385605400897089538]: First of all, the proposer is submitting the proposal because he/she does not foresee that such a decision will be made, but this can be done rather easily by self-determination. The first question to ask is, "If this project is accepted, what will you do first thing tomorrow?" You can ask yourself if you can answer the question, "If this project is accepted, what will you do first thing tomorrow? This is a question that we also ask those who pass the screening process.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385606475116994564]: The reason I ask this question is because if I can't answer it, it means I can't do anything unless I tell you what to do, and I Basically, I don't tell them what to do. This is probably why the term "[self-motivation]" is used. I don't pull people who don't move on their own.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385606970422431751]: So far, I've dropped people from the application screening process because they were "not specific enough". I guess it is necessary to think about what is necessary for such people to be able to run on their own. I guess the first thing I need to do is to Google what I'm proposing and find something similar.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385607716228370439]: Most ideas are similar. If you find something similar, find out how it works. If you find a word you don't understand, look it up too. If you keep repeating this, you will either understand how it works, or you will realize that the mountain you were trying to climb is much higher than you expected.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385609013329481730]: If you know how it works, you will know the Next Action. If you realize that the mountain is too big, the next action would be "how to make it smaller". For example, even if you cannot do 100% of what you want to do with existing tools, try to do as much as you can first. Then, "the rest" is the problem to be solved.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385609311007563780]: the "rest" will be smaller than the initial "whole" and the knowledge gained from doing as much as you can will be headlight and better observed You will be able to do it [when what you want to do is ambiguous].

>[ukkaripon https://twitter.com/ukkaripon/status/1385606524559450122]: sometimes you're applying because you want advice on what to do next, maybe.
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385608032793423872]: If that's the case, then the system should be improved because resources are being wasted on both sides due to mismatched intentions. For example, provide easier documentation and create a contact point where people can ask "what should I do next?".
	>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385610579767746563]: If this story is about the application process to satisfy the desire to know what the next action is, then it is fundamentally wrong, and you should take knowledge acquisition actions to at least find out the next action before applying. If you don't know how to do it, or if you don't know how to do it, then the mechanism is not well designed.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385612542412660738]: next story. The pattern of thinking about what you want to make, then researching similar things, and then finding an existing tool that seems to do what you want to do, but you're just applying for it. This is also, well, "let's use it" first. When you use it, you'll see the pros and cons.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385612732951498754]: this is another of those "resolution is increased by comparing it to something similar" types of things.

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385613515625426949]:[same -> difference?]

>[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385616531258634245]:[nishio https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1385616531258634245]: "Type 1" of this I wrote in 2018 was intended for cases where the "objective" is abstract, but for proposals where the Next Action is unknown, the "means" are abstract It's a [type 1 advice to contest entrants].
