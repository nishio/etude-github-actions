Event article is dying
 I attended [Scrapbox Drinkup 20180810] yesterday as a blogger slot and wrote an event post, but after one night I thought event posts were dead.

 I feel like I'm still alive at the time I wrote it.
	 I may add or reread it after a bit of time, but it will shortly be unedited.
 	Changed the title from "The Event Article is Dead" to "The Event Article is Dying".
 Why it will no longer be edited is because it's positioned as "[a] record of past facts."
  [the unchanging past], so it feels wrong to rewrite it.

	We should let as many "[children]" as possible be born before the dying event article is completely dead.
