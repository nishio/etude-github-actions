	Sequel to [Prisoner Training
	The second part, "joint training," is training related to joint mobility.
		To put it simply, for a 38 year old like me, training for "40 shoulder prevention".
		Flexible muscular strength = "flexibility in the presence of muscle tension."
		Mobility and flexibility are two different things.
			Soft, unexerted muscles do not contribute to better body control.
		Stretching is classified into two types
			Passive stretching: stretching muscles and soft tissues in a relaxed state using an external force.
			Active Stretching

	In the second part, three training programs are presented
		bridge hold
		L hold
		twist hold
	[Twist hold" is the one you often see macho guys twisting.
	As of May 9, 2019
		Bridge hold is not difficult in any way, STEP2
		I haven't tried the L hold because I don't have a chair with the proper handles.
			Maybe STEP 1 can.
			Good if you progress to STEP 3, you don't need a chair and can do it at home.
			Abdominal and core muscle strength is underwhelming.
		Twist hold clockwise is STEP 3, counterclockwise is STEP 2
			Distortion of the body is evident.
			My wife could easily do STEP 4.
