Predictable irrationality
The original title of the book was Predictably Irrational.

There is a nuance of "[predictable]." It is not randomly deviating from a rational solution, that would be [unpredictable]. It deviates from a rational solution in a particular direction, so it is [predictable].

With "irrational as expected," one could interpret it as "irrational or not irrational? It could be interpreted as "I expected it to be irrational, and it was irrational as expected," but it could also be interpreted as "Humans are irrational. How irrational? I expected that it would deviate in the direction of X from a rational choice. The nuance is more in the direction of "it was irrational as expected".

It was mentioned in [Motivation 3.0].
