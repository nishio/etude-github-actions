infectious loussaintiman
	Older people who are [infected] with [lusantiman] preach to young people, and innocent young people are [infected] with [lusantiman].
 Rusantiman is a rather infectious [meme], and there are many infected people, so the infected people will gather together and cause an [echo chamber] effect.
		[Echo chamber phenomenon - Wikipedia https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%81%E3%82%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E7%8F% BE%E8%B1%A1]
	While it is good to have a mindset based on lusantimanism, it is not good to mistakenly believe that it is the only correct one.
 	It was pointed out over 100 years ago that there are two kinds of ideas: [monarch morality and slave morality].
 It is better not to assimilate to the same ideology (i.e., become infected [carriers]), but to understand the ideology but identify with it as something different from oneself (i.e., after infection, heal and become [immune]).
 	Having [emulators] is beneficial in itself.
