Task difficulty and subjective difficulty
[https://gyazo.com/19150cb07c91fbfc7465466c19793403]

Everyone mistakenly believes that their subjective difficulty is the difficulty of the task, but it is subjective, so there are discrepancies from person to person.
When one person X looks like another person Y is C (when they seem to be struggling with a simple task).
From Y, X looks like B.
(They appear to have no clue about difficult tasks).

[metaphor for pushing through a wasteland]
	Person X, who limits the search range narrowly, reaches the answer faster than person Y, who does not limit the search range, if the answer is within the limit.
	On the other hand, if there is no answer within the limit, Y can be reached, but X cannot.
