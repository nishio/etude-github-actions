Shortest Hamilton Road Problem
The problem of finding the shortest path through all vertices once.
It's a "path," so it doesn't go back to the starting point.

The case of returning to the starting point is called the [Shortest Hamiltonian Closed Path Problem
Also known as [the traveling salesman problem].
It seems that even if they don't return to the starting point, they're perceived as if they're salesmen who never return.
