sponge scheme
It is a type of fraud in which money obtained from new investors is distributed as dividends to previous investors to make it appear as if a proper business is being conducted. Here we touch on the game of the same name.

 The card on the field is in the form of "receive X money now and pay Z every Y turns".
  Naturally, in the long run, the company is in the red.
	Game ends when a player becomes unable to pay = bankrupt.
 Scores are better if you have many business tiles of the same type.

	A game that incorporates negotiation by providing a means of exchanging banknotes invisible to other players called a "wallet.
 The cash you have or the price you put on the sale or purchase of your business will be undisclosed.

	Buying business tiles from the other party
  Receive the contents of the wallet and pass the business tile to the other party.
  Return to the other party the same amount of cash in the wallet as was in the wallet, and receive one of his/her business tiles.
 You can take one business tile each turn, but not after the fourth tile of the same color.
  Take a different color and sell it to someone who collects that color.
  Buy from others for money.
