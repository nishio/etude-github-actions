There is only one frame.
>Yutabon can live with that, but why do I have to go to school? I told him that Yutabon could get a position with that, but there is only one "Yutabon slot", so he won't survive if he does the same thing.

Good explanation
　In other words, in a game where you are competing for [limited resources], if there is only one resource, the first person to do it grabs it, so you can't get the same thing by copying it later.
　In a game where power is allowed to compete for resources, the "most powerful of those who want it" wins because those who come later and are more powerful take it.
　　This is a metaphor for physical prowess, but it's the same thing when a large company with name value and existing business synergies imitates a product developed by a weak company and steals its customers.
　It is not clear if we can survive if we move in the direction of the majority.
　　You're using the metaphor of living unconsciously and dying, but you're not going to die plainly either way, you're just going to live a life with a slowly declining rate of agency.
