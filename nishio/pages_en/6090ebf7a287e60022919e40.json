 *1210548977*I'm not feeling well.
 
 To rest or not to rest, that is the question.
 
 -----
 
 Anyway, I boot myself up with the usual procedures, and I go to work because I feel a little feverish and my joints hurt, but the important thing is that my left eye seems to be feeling better. And my eating habits are terrible when I'm at home.
 
 -----
 
 I wore OA glasses and a sun visor just in case, but in the process of coming to work, I already felt discomfort in my left eye...hmmm.
 
 *1210560557*id
 nishio is not me! I'm too sorry if all the trackbacks are misdirected to me, so please don't do it!
 
 *1210561394*[en] Mistakes about "mistakes".
 >>
 About 359,000 Japanese pages matching "There is a mistake
 Could be: there is a mistake.

 >>
 About 1,030,000 Japanese pages that match "There is a mistake

 Machigare" is in the lower first conjugation because it is "machiganai," "machigasaru," "machigasaru," "machigasare," "machigasare," and "machigaro," while the noun form of other words in the lower first conjugation ends with the "e" dan. These words include "trash disposal," "triangular eating," "futebai," and "wait for." I wonder if this is the reason why we say "machage".
 Mistake" is a relatively new way of saying "mistaken" and was originally "mistaken". This is the fifth dan conjugation, since it means "I won't make a mistake," "I'll make a mistake," "I'll make a mistake," "If I make a mistake," or "I'll make a mistake. In the fifth dan conjugation, the noun form ends in the "い" dan, as in "writing things," "looking for oneself," and "remembering and laughing.
 
 *1210566888*[Python]reverse of zip
 The opposite of zip is unzip, JK.
 
 -r0c I wonder if there is a function that does the reverse of zip()
 --http://twitter.com/r0c/statuses/794804246
 
 The zip will revert back to its original state after two applications.
 >|python|
 >>> zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
 [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
 >>> zip(*_)
 [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]
 >>> zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9])
 [(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]
 >>> zip(*_)
 [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)]
 ||<
 However, information such as "whether it was originally a list, a tuple, or a string" will be lost. If you don't like this, you need to make a zip file that preserves the type information. I don't know when there is such a need.
 
 >|python|
 >>> zip("abc", ["+", "-"])
 [('a', '+'), ('b', '-')]

 *1210568699*[Mac]Making Effects for CamTwist was super easy.
 1. start QuartzComposer
 Select Image Filter in the first dialog that appears.
 A zoom blur filter will appear as a sample, and save it under an appropriate name in /Applications/CamTwist/Effects.
 When you start CamTwist, you will see the name you just saved in the Effect list!
 5. when I check the image on Ustream, I see that the image is sent with zoom blur!
 
 
 So I thought that if I make an Effect that says "save image locally without processing", I will be happy to deliver video using CamTwist on Ustream and save it locally with high quality, but I couldn't figure out how to save the input image to a file in QC, so I need some help. Please help me id:akio0911 !

 It would be good to make a moira QCPatch.

 In the meantime, I downloaded this: http://kineme.net/XcodeTemplateForCustomQuartzComposerPatches
 I followed the instructions and a new CustomPatch was added to QC. Too easy.
 But today I forgot my AC adapter, so I don't have power anymore. Orz.

 <body>If the imperfect form starts with "wa", does that mean that "makimasu" and "makimasuaba" were originally "makimasu" and "makimasuaba"? </body>

 <body>Oh, but double-encoding ust and local is going to shake out the CPU.

 <body>Hello,<br>How to save the input image in QC, <br>I will have to re-encode it, but there is this in the EXAMPLE. <br>/Developer/Examples/Quartz Composer/Plugins/MovieExporter <br>Build it, put it in <br>/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins/<br>and restart it. <br><br>Build it and put it in <br>/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins/<br>and restart it. <br><br>But since it is QC, it does not record audio. </body><br><br
