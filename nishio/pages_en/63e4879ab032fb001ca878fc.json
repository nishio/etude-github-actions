　I've seen the English version of this, and I see, I can see how this could confuse some people.
　	"datatypes that represent a value 'over time' " = Behavior
　That's what this is all about, isn't it?
　Change the cognitive part of what combination of parts describes the world.
　Maybe someone with some experience in electronic circuit design would understand it better.
　WIRE is a voltage varying entity
　Consider this a first class existence.
　Placing a part is a description of the relationship between its existence
　Declarative, you might say.
　It is necessary to describe the world with this kind of cognition "different from the architecture of today's computers" and then put it into a form that can be executed by today's computers.
　	[" the big difference is the separation between Behaviors and Events]
　　　You can't confuse the two here.
　　　Fundamentally, you don't know what you're doing to make it first class.

I tried to write an explanation and realized I didn't understand it.
　I realized that I don't know enough about it to explain it, so I'll just take a quick look at it this time.
　Instead of destructively rewriting a single object along a time line,
　Takes an unchangeable (immutable) object, creates a new object and returns it
　Mental model of a message flowing in a stream
