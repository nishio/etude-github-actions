Unexpected event â†’ change of policy
Unexpected successes and failures are [observed fact] that [understanding] and [reality] of the past are [discrepancy]. Therefore, [learning opportunity] = an opportunity to [correct] the [discrepancy] between [understanding] and [reality]. And once the understanding is corrected, the best policy based on the old understanding and the best policy based on the new understanding are different, so a [change of policy] ([pivot]) will take place. A good situation is when this "unexpected event" is quickly followed by a "change of policy," but there are often factors that prevent this from happening. If [evaluation] is based on the [achievement rate] of the [plan] at the beginning of the year, and the results of actions not in the plan are not evaluated, there will be no [motivation] for the policy change.
