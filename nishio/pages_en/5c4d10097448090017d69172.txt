Three stages of interpersonal relationships
[https://gyazo.com/67f4f2bf3766d99527d3faf873fb3da3]
	1: [dependent].
		Every human being goes through a child state.
		Growing up with help from adults around you
		Often becomes a compulsion due to differences in body size.
	2: [Independent].
		As they grow older, they reject help.
		Can do it alone, hide weaknesses.
		Repulsion is also strong, especially when raised in a coercive environment.
	3: [interdependent].
		A [win-win] deal between equal adults
		A relationship in which you fill in the other person's weaknesses, and in return, the other person fills in your weaknesses.
		We need to [share our weaknesses].


	[Dependence → Independence → Interdependence] was also discussed in the 7 Habits.
	The story of children being affected by the physical difference from adults was also discussed in [Adlerian psychology].
	I thought the case of [throwing away options due to pride] was caused by stopping at step 2.
