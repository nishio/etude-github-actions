　I suddenly entered a 4-on-4 team competition in [GeoGuessr] [nishio.icon].
　　More prep is needed!

	Google Earth at a random location is displayed.
	Guess where on earth it is.

	I bought the iOS version.
		Random across the globe free of charge
		Famous Place, Major Cities, etc., you can pay $360 or buy them with points that you accumulate by playing.
	Personally, I would recommend buying Famous Place with a quick charge.
		'Oh, this is the Louvre!' It'll feel like a play like that.

Considerations on Game Structure
	Quiz game with image +α as input and position as output
	Unlike typical quiz shows, the interesting point is that the output is not "words" but "positions".
		The distance from the correct location determines the score.
		A: "Oh, it's in South America, what is it? In the "word quiz", B>>A), but in the "location quiz", C: "Machu Picchu is in India, isn't it? A's score is higher than B's (A>>C).
		Even if you know that the Leaning Tower of Pisa is in Italy, if you don't know where Pisa is, you won't get any points.
		So it's interesting to see how "non-linguistic knowledge" grows during repeated play!
			Pisa is in that part of Italy."
			Due to Google Map specifications, the more minor a location is, the more you have to zoom in to see it.

			If you know approximately where it is, you can zoom in on that area to find it.

			Mont Saint-Michel is in France, but where is it now?
　　Conversely, it is interesting to note that in some cases "positional knowledge is verbalized and stored
　　Where is Machu Picchu?"
　　It's in South America."
　　It's in Peru, not Chile."
　　It's in Cusco, Peru."

			It's in Aguas something, northwest of Cusco.

			There it is!"

	It's hard to remember where the square monastery is.
	I can't remember where the semi-circular castle is.
