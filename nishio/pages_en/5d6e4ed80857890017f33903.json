Easy-to-read text in video
[Premiere Pro]
Black text is difficult to see when the background is dark, and white text is difficult to see when the background is light.
It is troublesome to adjust it well when the background is not of one color or something.
An easy solution to this is to "add both a white border and a shadow."

 Font size 200
 Paint: Red
 Stroke: white 20
 Shadow: 75% 135 10 20 40
		Shadow could be a little bigger.
			I made it 30, 70, 40.

I think this red and white version has a noticeable noise when made into a thumbnail.
	For thumbnails, it would be better to eliminate strokes and use simple, large letters.

I set the shadow to 30 70 40 and I felt like this would be fine because it would be easy to read regardless of the background color on a white background.
