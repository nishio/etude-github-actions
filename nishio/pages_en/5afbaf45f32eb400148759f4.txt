Principle that the learning curve is an S-curve
[https://gyazo.com/cc5eda93b5e5b7ccc1bdac3439dc9f03]
 Model the knowledge acquisition process as follows
 	many-to-many
  multistory
  Upper layer knowledge cannot be acquired directly.
  When you acquire lower layers of knowledge, you acquire higher layers of knowledge by luck #Abstraction
  The more you know about higher layers of knowledge, the lower the cost of acquiring lower layers of knowledge.
 In this model, the amount of knowledge gained per unit of time is [cumulative
 	Because the cost of acquiring knowledge at the higher layers gradually decreases and the cost of acquiring knowledge at the lower layers decreases, increasing the amount of knowledge acquired per cost.
	On the other hand, the number of upper layers of knowledge per number of lower layers of knowledge acquired [saturates
 	When 0 → 1, any of the N higher layers of knowledge may be acquired, but when N-1 → N, the last one must be acquired, since there is an approximately N-fold difference in probability
	These combine to form an [S-shaped] curve.
