Do we keep dead texts?
Q1: To keep or to throw away?
 Electronic information is not bulky, so storage costs are low.
　If the return exceeds the cost of storage, it is reasonable to store it.

Q2: Where to store them?
　[One pocket principle.]
　Shouldn't be more than one place to look.
　I prefer to store them in Scrapbox considering

Q3: How is this consistent with "[not to be a warehouse where dead text is placed]"?
　Does "not to be a warehouse for dead texts" mean "not to be a place to put only dead texts" or "not to put a single dead text?"
　I think it's the former.
　If the "living text" is adequate, there's no real harm if the dead text sinks beneath it.
