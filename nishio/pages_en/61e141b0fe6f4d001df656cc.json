Sprouting is unmanageable.
[The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production] p.186 [(6.1.2.4) Sprouting is unmanageable].
>Bud growth is unmanageable.
>After learning about the thinking methods of our predecessors, I realized that the task of coming up with ideas is composed of many detailed tasks. I organized these detailed tasks into three phases: "cultivate," "sprout," and "nurture.
>The cultivating and nurturing phases can be task managed. However, the sprouting phase cannot be managed. You cannot make them sprout through effort, and they do not always sprout if you wait. Whether or not an idea will sprout is a matter of luck.
>... Spend a good amount of time cultivating to increase the probability of good ideas sprouting as much as possible... Manage what you can and don't manage what you can't, this is the maximum effort to generate good ideas.
