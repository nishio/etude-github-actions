For some X
　At some point, the utility of X generates positive feedback that increases X
　　This is the first watershed.
　As X increases, the growth of utility of X slows ([diminishing marginal utility])
　On the other hand, suppose that the disadvantage (ineffectiveness) of increasing X is not diminishing.
　　Or the pace of diminishing returns is slow.
　Someday X's utility will outweigh its ineffectiveness.
　　At this moment, existence turns socially toxic.
