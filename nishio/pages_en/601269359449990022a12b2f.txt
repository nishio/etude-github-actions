	Returned to machine learning to determine the naturalness of questions.
		If you don't solve the problem of the baseline being off by the question, it's not good enough.

[nisbot.icon]What would you like to see happen in this conversation?
[nishio.icon] I've turned back on the machine learning [naturalness of questions] that I had temporarily turned off, and I want to test it.
[nisbot.icon]What type of judgment is that?
[nishio.icon] Binary classification as natural or not natural for the immediately preceding document/question pair, ignoring context
[nisbot.icon]What type of context is that context?
I haven't looked at [nishio.icon]the relationship between the multiple series of questions or anything like that. So it's possible to put this in and have an unnatural flow as a whole, and that's hard to test at hand, so I'm just trying to use it in practice.
[nisbot.icon]What type of question is that?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > I haven't looked at the relationship between the multiple series of questions or anything like that. So it's possible that the overall flow could be unnatural with this in there, and that's hard to test at hand, so I'm just trying to use it in practice.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this question?
[nishio.icon]Like, if you don't ask this first, it's not natural to ask this out of the blue.

 Where is this question?

 What does this question seem to be?

 What type of linkage is this linkage?
[nishio.icon]For example, "Is there anything else?" would be funny if it came out of nowhere.
[nisbot.icon]

 Is there anything else about this decision?
[nishio.icon]Nothing in particular
[nisbot.icon]
 > Binary classification as natural or not natural for the immediately preceding document/question pair, ignoring context
 Is there anything else about this context?
[nishio.icon]This time, there were many test cases regarding the flow behavior, so I was able to notice once the flow was broken, and I was able to fix it and confirm that it was back to normal.
[nisbot.icon]What type of behavior is that?
[nishio.icon] "Is there anything else?" is now asked first.
[nisbot.icon]What kind of destination is that?
[nishio.icon] "What kind of X is that X?" before asking.
[nisbot.icon]Anything else about beyond that?
[nishio.icon]If you just cut out the question and ask if it's natural, "What kind of X?" is more unnatural than "What else is there?" is more unnatural than "What else?
[nisbot.icon]What type of type is that?
[nishio.icon]NGKW Type
[nisbot.icon]How do you know that question?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > If you just cut out the question and ask if it's natural, the question is, "What kind of X?" is more unnatural than "What other kind of X?" is more unnatural than "What else?
 What kind of X ka is this X ka?
[nishio.icon]NGKW X.
[nisbot.icon]
 > "What kind of X is that X?" before asking.
 Where is this destination?
[nishio.icon]NGKW destination
[nisbot.icon]
 > "What kind of X is that X?" before asking.
 What kind of X is this X?
[nishio.icon]NGKW X
[nisbot.icon]
 > Binary classification as natural or not natural for the immediately preceding document/question pair, ignoring context
 Where is this context?
[nishio.icon]The flow of questions being repeated
[nisbot.icon]
 > Since there were many test cases for flow behavior this time, I was able to notice once the flow was broken and was able to fix it and confirm that it was back to normal.
 Is there anything else you can tell us about this behavior?
[nishio.icon]In the end, we decided not to make a naturalness judgment on the two basic questions because we could not reconcile the fact that there is a comfortable order regarding the two basic questions with the fact that the naturalness as individual questions does not match that order.
[nisbot.icon]How will you know the decision?
[nishio.icon]Users don't know how it's determined internally.
[nisbot.icon]What type of user is that user?
[nishio.icon]Users of this chat
[nisbot.icon]Is there anything else you can tell us about that user?
[nishio.icon]I want to be asked a good question.
[nisbot.icon]What do you value?
[nishio.icon]It would be good if the naturalness of questions could be judged to reduce the number of cases where clearly unnatural questions are posed to users, which impairs their comfort.
[nisbot.icon]Where is that user located?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > It would be good if the naturalness of questions could be judged to reduce the number of cases where clearly unnatural questions are asked to the user, which impairs the user's comfort.
 What is the relationship between this question and the user?
[nishio.icon] Information is drawn from the user by being asked questions.
[nisbot.icon]Is the user the same as the question? Are they different?
[nishio.icon]No, it's not.
[nisbot.icon]
 > It would be good if the naturalness of questions could be judged to reduce the number of cases where clearly unnatural questions are asked to the user, which impairs the user's comfort.
 What happens to the user when this question is asked?
[nishio.icon]If you ask good questions, users are led to a flow state by a series of moderately sized tasks. If you ask a bad question, the user is confused and the flow is interrupted.
[nisbot.icon] What happens to the question when that user?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > It would be good if the naturalness of questions could be judged to reduce the number of cases where clearly unnatural questions are asked to the user, which impairs the user's comfort.
 What is the connection between this question and the user?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > In the end, I decided not to make a naturalness judgment on the two basic questions because I could not reconcile the comfortable order regarding the two basic questions with the fact that their naturalness as individual questions did not match that order.
 What is the relationship between this decision and the question?
If the [nishio.icon]judgment is well done, the quality of questions will improve. If it's not done well, it's worse.
[nisbot.icon]Is that decision the same as the question? Is it different?
[nishio.icon]No, it's not.
[nisbot.icon]
 > If the judgment is well done, the quality of questions will improve. If it's not done well, it will get worse.
 What happens to the question when this judgment is made?
[nishio.icon]If the baseline for judging is off, only questions that tend to be natural as a base will be selected, and we'll lose the diversity of questions.
[nisbot.icon]What happens to the judgment when you ask that question?
[nishio.icon]🙁
[nisbot.icon]
 > If the baseline for judging is off, you're going to lose the diversity of questions by selecting only questions that tend to be natural as a base.
 What is the relationship between this decision and the user?
[nishio.icon](For now, I was concerned that it would slow down the response time, but that's not really harmful. The issue of the baseline being off depending on the question needs to be resolved, imho) 🙁.
