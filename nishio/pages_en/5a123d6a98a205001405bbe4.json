The Parable of the Sharpest Talent
	There are expressions such as "[sharp personnel]" and "[round personnel]" for human resources.
  Image of a [sharp] stone and a round stone by a river, etc.
  The analogy of "a sharp stone becoming round" is often used.

	'Sharp people become rounded.'
  Some interpret it negatively, others positively.
  How to perceive people who feel negatively:
   The sharpest points are strengths and areas of expertise
   Excellent engineers become [mediocre] round stones when the [homogenization] pressure of large companies squeezes out their [sharp edges].
  How to perceive people who feel positive:
   The sharp part is the lack of [cooperativeness] due to youth.
   If you're sharp, you'll bump into other people and cause unnecessary [friction].
   The sharp edges are removed as they are struggled with, and they become rounded and "[amicable].
  The fact that these two interpretations are not even independent makes the problem deeper.

The two correspond to the words "[specialist]" and "[generalist]".
