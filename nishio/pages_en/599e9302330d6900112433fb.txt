Chronology of learning
Why are you interested in learning?" I started collecting historical facts to answer the question, "Why were you interested in learning? This is a place to accumulate detailed facts without consideration for the reader.

 2004 "It's important to learn to compare languages."
  When I was a PhD student, I taught programming to junior students, comparing Java and Python.
	2007 [PythonDevelopersCamp2007 Winter: You don't need classes! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=legkcj5vQN8&feature=youtu.be], "I thought you really thought of a way to share an easy-to-understand way of understanding how it works."

	2008 The first technical book I wrote [Jython Programming http://blog.livedoor.jp/dankogai/archives/51040648.html] was unexpectedly acclaimed as "a very well written programming beginner's book". [unexpected success].
 Lecture at 2010 Security & Programming Camp on "[Design Decisions for Languages https://www.slideshare.net/nishio/ss-5019563]"

 The feature article was so well received that we decided to write a book.
  I wrote, "It's important to learn languages by comparing them."
  I started thinking about "why it's important" and wrote a chapter about it, but it was cut by an editorial decision.
  [Knowledge, Capitalism, and the Technologist Condition]
 At the time of publication, it was reprocessed and put together in the form of promotional slides.

  I received feedback that the column was helpful in response to something I wrote in the form of a fragmentary column, so I'm convinced that I should dig deeper into this.
