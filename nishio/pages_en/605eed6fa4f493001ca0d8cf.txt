ðŸ¤”Allow footer to be specified when exporting to Scrapbox
I did [âœ…Insert URL when exporting to Scrapbox] because I want it, but it is unnecessary for the average user.
On the other hand, I think there are cases where you want to add a common footer to the log, so it would be good to have a footer specification function.
