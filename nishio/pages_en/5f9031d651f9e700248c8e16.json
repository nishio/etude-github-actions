obsolete rule prohibiting match-ups between wrestlers from the same group of stables
I want to take the product of N numbers minus one
	see [cumulative product from left to right].
 	The product in this case is not limited to multiplication.
 		gcd: [ABC125C]
 	[交換法則], [結合法則]が成り立つ
 	There is no [inverse element].
 	　In the case of additions with inverse yuan, etc., it is even easier because you can take the sum of the whole and add the inverse yuan of the one you want to remove
