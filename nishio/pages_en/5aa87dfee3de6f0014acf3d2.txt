Leading painters
 A [first-class] painter paints what he thinks is good.
 Second-rate painters paint what the public thinks is good.
 Third-rate painters paint what they think "the world thinks is good".

explanation
 Third-rate painters paint what they think "the public will think is good," but in reality it is not.
  self-serving assumption
  If you can actually draw "what the public thinks is good", you are promoted to second class.
 But first-class is not an extension of this. As long as it is measured by the world's evaluation, it stops at second class.
 A common misconception: "If you paint what you think is good, you're top-notch."
  You've got your logic backwards.
  Paint only what you think is good and often die unappreciated.

 I'm trying to find the source of this because I remember seeing it in something, but I haven't found it.
  Pointing out that it is Fernando Pessoa.
   >A first-rate poet says what he actually feels, a second-rate poet says what he thinks he feels, and a third-rate poet says what he thinks he must feel
   Quite similar.
   I guess I read someone else's modification/explanation of this as the original story, and that further denatured it for me.

 >Third-rate consultants speak by example
 >Second-rate consultants speak with data.
 >Leading consultants speak with their hearts.
  >Discontinuous growth is not an extension of fact.
