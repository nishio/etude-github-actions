 *1446435463*Configuration for connecting to Wifi from a Raspberry Pi.
 The network settings differ depending on whether the access point is WEP or WPA, etc., but I don't think they are well organized, so I will summarize them here. If there are any mistakes, please point them out.
 
 ** Connect to an access point with no password
 
 Sometimes there is free wifi at inns, etc.
 
 Write the following in /etc/network/interfaces
 
 >||
 wireless-essid <YOUR_SSID>
 ||<
 
 ** WEP
 
 Write the following in /etc/network/interfaces
 
 >||
 wireless-essid <YOUR_SSID>
 wireless-key s:<YOUR_KEY> 
 ||<
 
 PS, I had a problem with an access point that somehow became 169.254.... (self-assigned IP) with this configuration. I was able to connect by writing the following in wpa_supplicant.conf. I am not sure what the difference is.
 
 >||
 network={
         ssid="<YOUR_SSID>"
         key_mgmt=NONE
         wep_key0="<YOUR_KEY>"
 }
 ||<
 
 ** WPA
 
 Write the following in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
 
 >||
 network={
     ssid="<YOUR_SSID>"
     psk="<YOUR_KEY>"
 }
 ||<
 
 There is a way to use wpa_passphrase to not store passwords in plain text. Also, some blogs claim that you need to set key_mgmt, proto, pairwise, group, etc. other than ssid and psk, but it is not a MUST. I tried several times to set the parameters correctly except for ssid and psk, but in the end, I chose "none of the above" and the connection was made easily.
