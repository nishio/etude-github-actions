CID problem
I installed PDFMiner with pip to extract text from a Japanese PDF and the following problem occurred.
>I(cid:888), Intellectual Production Techniques(cid:887)Good(cid:845)Reference(cid:853)Greed(cid:864)(cid:845)(cid:880)(cid:866). People(cid:884)intellectual production techniques(cid:923)teaching(cid:849)(cid:916).
Solution: see [Extract text from PDF].

  This one, like my environment, has hiragana as CID.
