 *1243049752*To Tama Center
 I learned that the Toei Shinjuku Line now connects to Chofu and Tama Center.
 
 *1243050607* Sasazuka
 Now waiting at Sasazuka for the train to Hashimoto
 
 *1243053669*Tama Center
 Exit in the opposite direction
 
 There was a QBHOUSE at the station. Let's get a haircut on the way home.
 
 *1243053982*Far
 I should be able to walk along this.

 *1243065728*Make: Tokyo Meeting 03
 now participating
 
 <a href='http://ouch-ouch-ouch.blogspot.com/'>Ouch</a> had a workshop where you can make a paper craft of Theo Jansen's mechanism. Theo Jansen used GA to create those dimensions. I see. Attempts to imitate life have been repeated for hundreds of years, and now we have a strong ally in the modern world, the computer.
 
 Bio-media art using bacteria <a href='http://www.f.waseda.jp/hideo-iwasaki/'>Hideo Iwasaki Laboratory, School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University</a> was amazing. Unfortunately, the video is not available yet.
 
 Also, the exhibit of rotating optical fibers to create mysterious objects was interesting.
 
 The urge to make something is stronger than writing an entry, but what should I make?

 *1243081849*[SVG]Z Order

 It's off by default, but if you set the output destination to ZOrderedBuffer instead of file or stdout when you create the context
 >|python|
     cont = Context(out=ZOrderedBuffer())
 ||<
 You can change the z-order with Context#zorder as shown below.
 >|python|
     cont.loop(10, lambda cont:cont.trans(1).hsv(30).zorder(1), lambda cont: cont.circle())
     cont.trans(y=2).loop(10, lambda cont:cont.trans(1).hsv(30).zorder(-1), lambda cont: cont.circle())
 ||<
 
 Right now, the implementation is to store it in a buffer once and sort it by Z at the end before outputting. I thought about doing some things to save memory, but if such "last shot" sorting is too heavy and needs to be tuned, the rendering part would be very difficult to begin with. So I put it on hold. If I did that, I wasn't going to be able to finish it on the train on the way home. Small start is important.
 
 *1243089962*[SVG]batik
 Rather convenient, batik. this is better than previewing in a browser.
 
 *1243096609*MTM03 for tomorrow
 I was asked if I wanted to display something, so I decided to take this guy and display him.

 Surprisingly, no one seems to know why this is a "seven-section" exhibit, so tomorrow I will exhibit a set with an unpacking of it.
 
 Oh, I was thinking about how to display them, but I have a lot of blank cards and sleeves, so I should write the answers on the back of the questions. That way they won't show through.
 
 I can make 4 sets of cards if I make them in print. Maybe I should show three more problems. I don't really like this one as art, but as a riddle, it is very make-able.

 <body>This is a picture of fiber optics. I took it with a shutter speed of 1 second or something like that... <br>http://picasaweb.google.co.jp/lh/photo/VtZaCc4x42zthNtR44ulOg?feat=directlink</body>

 <body>Oh, this is some other kind of art<br>The glowing type of art can be created a second time by taking a picture with a camera...</body>.

 <body>The idea of "long shutter speeds in dark places"<br>- Long lines of car lights in night scenes<br>- Shooting fireworks<br>- Shooting celestial bodies leaves trails due to their rotation<br>- Shooting displays using saccades (which Altman did in MTM3)<br>- Shooting a display using a saccade (which Altman did in MTM3). The camera is a very good tool for this purpose. </body>

 <BODY>If you make something new and shiny that no one has ever seen before, and then take a picture of it, the picture will also be something new that no one has ever seen before. If sunlight can be used, for example, we could arrange a number of prisms and use motors to rotate them. This is the only thing I can think of right now, but I think there are a lot of interesting ways to create light works. </body

 <BODY>I think you can't shoot what you want to shoot if you don't know the key points of shooting. <BR><BR><BR>I think it is better to understand how "what is already there" is being photographed in order to reach the "new thing" more quickly. <BR><BR>If I were to write down the points, it would be less orthogonal,<BR>- the aperture time<BR>- fixing the camera, using remote relase<BR>- the brightness of the subject and surroundings<BR>- the speed at which the subject is moving<BR>- and so on. <BR><BR>Since you seem to be reading a book on art theory, I don't need to tell you about recognizing "what's new". <BR><BR>I look forward to your photos of new things. </body>
