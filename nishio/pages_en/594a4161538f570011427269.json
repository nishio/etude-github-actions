hippocampus
　Part of the limbic system called the hippocampal formation
 It is divided into the dentate gyrus (dentate gyrus), hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex.
 Dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and hippocampal branchia have a single cell layer
 	The top and bottom are flanked by a low cell density layer and a cell-free layer.
 Other areas consist of multiple layers.
 	The simple layered structure found in the dentate gyrus and hippocampus has contributed to advances in neuroanatomy and electrophysiology.


	Andersen et al. (1971) argued for the importance of a characteristic circuit that connects each part of the hippocampal body in one direction, which they named the "trisynaptic circuit.
 Because most sensory information flows to the hippocampus through the entorhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex is often considered the starting point of the trisynaptic circuit.
 The entorhinal cortex is composed of two adjacent cortical areas
 	Perirhinal cortex
  postrhinal cortex (called parahippocampal cortex in primates)
 The information is received from the
 Much of this input is excitatory (Martina et al., 2001).
 The vastus lateralis cortex (retrosplenial cortex) is also apparently a source of sensory information (van Groen and Wyss, 1992, Wyss and van Groen, 1992).

 Claims of input from layer 3 of the olfactory entorhinal cortex to CA2 in 2010.
 	In 2013, RIKEN claimed it was wrong [http://www.riken.jp/pr/press/2013/20131219_2/].
  That's about the time cycle that we're discussing, so it might not be a good idea to follow it too closely, right?
