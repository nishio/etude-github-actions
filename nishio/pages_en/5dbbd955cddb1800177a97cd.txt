Personal Groupware
[https://gyazo.com/905ec3dcdbb7b8d92a4659f72b815be0]
	The information in an individual's head could only be "[recalled]" by that individual.
	By writing in the groupware instead of keeping it in my head, others can [search] (i.e., "recall") it.
	But there are many hurdles to "writing in a place where everyone can see you.
　Psychological hurdles
　For example, copyrighted material that is OK for personal use but not to be shared by the company.
	Even individuals find it useful to write things down instead of keeping them in their heads, so they can search for them.
	I think it's better to separate "export" from "[share internally]".

We can achieve this by creating a private space in kintone without development, but I feel something is missing with that. What is it?
→[Privately owned groupware].
