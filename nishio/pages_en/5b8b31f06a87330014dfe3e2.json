Notation of authorship of OSS developed by many people
>I'm not sure if the MIT or BSD license of the OSS license can be used freely as long as the author is indicated, but if it is applied to a program developed by a large number of people, should the copyright be indicated for all the people or just the ones in the license file?

This is an interesting topic, so I'll try to write down my understanding of it.

First of all, more than 150 countries, including Japan, have adopted the "no-formality principle" under which copyright arises as soon as a work is created. So "whose name after (c)" is not a procedure for determining authorship. see [Berne Convention].

The license is also not a procedure for determining who the author is, since it is merely a statement of "the author grants use to others, under what conditions.

In the case of a program jointly created by several persons, where the contributions of each person cannot be separated and used individually (joint work, [Article 2(1)(12) of the Copyright Act, [https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/chosakukenhou.html#2.1.12]), [* the moral rights of the author cannot be exercised without the agreement of all the members] ([Article 64(1) https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/chosakukenhou.html#2.1.12]) and [* the shared copyright cannot be exercised either] ([Article 65(2) https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/chosakukenhou.html#2.1.12. moral rights cannot be exercised without agreement] ([Article 64(1) https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/chosakukenhou.html#64]) and [* shared copyright cannot be exercised] ([Article 65(2) https://nishio. github.io/better_egov/chosakukenhou.html#65.2])
	To put it more gently, "If something is made by everyone, everyone should agree on how to use it and decide together.
 Therefore, if Mr. A decides on a license and grants a license to use program X, which was jointly developed by Mr. A and Mr. B, without obtaining the agreement of Mr. B, Mr. A simply infringes the copyright.
 	Whether the license is something like "This software is under the MIT license, and you can use it freely if you put 'Program X Development Group' as the author" or not is completely irrelevant.
 On the other hand, it is OK to write "This software was created by Mr. A alone" as long as it can be agreed.

When there are many authors, the cost of "getting everyone to agree" when trying to change a license becomes very high, so move to a system where decisions can be made by a small number of people before that happens.
	As a concrete example, a mechanism called Sign-off is often used
 A mechanism to make it clear that the authors have agreed on various matters in advance.
 For example.
 	Donate copyrights to the project
  I will not exercise my moral rights.
  Mr. A agrees to exercise his moral rights on behalf of the author ([Article 64(3) https://nishio.github.io/better_egov/chosakukenhou.html#64.3])
	Linux Example
  [https://developercertificate.org/]
  	Surprisingly, there's no mention of moral rights.
   Well, if I insisted on letting them exercise their personal rights, Linus would probably give me a foul mouth...
