KJ method implementation proposal 1
	Allow some form of movement to the left or right.
 	When viewed from a distance, a number of round rooms are lined up on a flat surface.
  If we could add "[nameplate]" to this room, it would be a natural [KJ method].
  	[Grouping] is still a very important concept.
  	It's lame to assume that they line up on a flat surface.
		A sphere encompassing a room
   The slide closest to the Z+ direction of the room is temporarily used as the nameplate.
 		mind-mapping
   A central concept is placed at the center
  Grab the sphere and drag-drop to move.
  If the sphere moves to any desired position, the challenge is how to move between them.
