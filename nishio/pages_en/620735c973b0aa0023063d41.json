What one pursues, another persecutes.

What one pursues, another persecutes.

One half of the world laughs at the other, and so do all the fools.

Everything is good or evil according to the number of votes it gets. What one pursues, another persecutes. They are insufferable fools who seek to regulate everything according to their own ideas. Excellence does not depend on the pleasure of one person. There are many people, many tastes, all different. There is no flaw that one person does not appreciate. And there is no need to be discouraged by something that does not please some, because others will appreciate it. And there is no need to be swayed by criticism, because there will always be those who criticize. The true test of praise is the approval of a well-known person or an expert in the matter. We should aim not to be swayed by a single vote, a single fad, or a single century.
