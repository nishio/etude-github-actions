Need to zoom in to sketch to proper size
>I couldn't help but groan when the topic of "zooming" is necessary to sketch to the proper size. I think that can be laid out for more than just sketching.
>For example, writing 1000 words on a small subject will "zoom" differently than writing 1000 words on a large subject. If proper scaling is not done, you may not be able to fit in the text, and important parts may be left out. I think this "zoom" probably has something to do with how to write an idea memo.
