Shoeshine boy
People who are not actively gathering information.
　Often the information that comes to this person is bad information
　　Is it an exaggeration to go so far as to say that
　Do not spread information unless the spread of that information would be beneficial to person X who has the information.
　　Derived from this
　　　Information that is spread is not beneficial to the receiver, but information that is beneficial to the sender to spread
　　　When you add the "buy and sell" or "zero-sum" factor here, you derive "information spread is bad information".

The original story of "The Shoeshine Boy."
　You can find it by searching.
　An episode, supposedly made up, by Joseph P. Kennedy (father of U.S. President John F. Kennedy).
