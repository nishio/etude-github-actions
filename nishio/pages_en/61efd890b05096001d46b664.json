oddball canary theory (theory that placing a canary in a canary body is a sign that the canary has lost its identity)
The [average group] can detect a threat by having the [oddball] on the periphery so that when the [unexpected threat] approaches, the oddball is the first to die (the [canary] in the coal mine).

When a group is destroyed, the last person left is also a freak.

[The average group is not necessarily the majority.]
[Freaks become majority]
