Texting isn't killing them, people are.
The expression [dead text], it assumes that the text has the attribute of being "alive" or "dead," but sometimes a text that has been inactive for a long time and you thought was dead [sprouts] for some reason. [tree metaphor].

By assuming that something that is not really dead yet is dead, have we not killed it?
