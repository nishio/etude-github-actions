The [top of the pyramid] is like the North Star, a guide to the direction we should go.
This is not a strict determination of the path to be followed.
Sometimes you will encounter obstacles as you walk.
Sometimes you may discover an unexpected oasis in a direction slightly off from the direction you are traveling.
