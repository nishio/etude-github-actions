An example of intellectual production in the process of transferring data from other media to Scrapbox
 An example of [intellectual production] in the process of transferring data from other media to [Scrapbox].
 I tend to think it's a hassle and can't be transferred mechanically.
 Especially when the source of information is digital, we tend to think that we can't just copy and paste.
 But the subject of intellectual production is the human being, not the data.
 Once you have your own output data
 ã€€In the process of going through this information again, it is developed through [association], [elaboration], and [combination] with other information.
 Lose that opportunity by copying and pasting mechanically.
 Data that cannot pay the cost of going through you again is useless, so you don't have to import it.
	In [The Art of Intellectual Production of Engineers] p.99 "[The process of creating deepens understanding]", I also explained on the basis of [Craik&Tulving 1975] why it is better to create your own learning content instead of trying to find and download it.
