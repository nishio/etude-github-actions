Vaccination ticket is a ration ticket
>>Masanori Kusunoki Today I gave a lecture on the history of family registers and the resident system for the first time in about two years, but two years ago I never thought I would have to wait for the [ration ticket] to come or develop that kind of ledger in a rush. After all, terrorism, epidemics, and benefit deadlocks are the tipping point for the resident system.

What is [rationing]?
　>A structure or system in which the state or other public authority regulates the distribution or method of distribution of specific goods for specific policy purposes.

　So the public power controls [distribution] instead of letting the market do it.
