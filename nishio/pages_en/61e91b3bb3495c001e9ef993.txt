(5.4.3) Incremental improvement
In the previous section, I explain the trigger by others. I explain the other methods here.

[Incremental Writing] is an interesting method. [Piotr Wozniak] of [SuperMemo] proposed it. The system shows fragmentary texts at intervals that gradually become longer.

Some SNS, such as Facebook, have a feature to show the post on the same day of several years ago. It also works as a trigger. The sentences you wrote in the past give stimulation to you now. For example, if you see the sentences that you wrote three years ago and you think that is still important today, it means the sentences have long-lasting value. It is valuable to improve or develop this sentence. By other words, the sentences are improved incrementally.

I tried the incremental writing for a while planning this book. The stimulus of the sentences facilitates my output. It was interesting to me. This method may have the effect of developing our thought.

On the other hand, in the publishing process of a paper book, we have to make a certain amount of manuscript in a fixed period. The method of developing thought did not fit into this process.

As we learned in [(3.5) Spaced repetition method that lasts knowledge], it is useful to train long-term memory by repeat with an interval. It is not for a writing task with deadlines. It seems to be suitable for training ourselves in the long term.
