　It's only 1:00 p.m. and there's a heavy rain and flood warning in Tokyo,

>[https://twitter.com/nishio/status/1571173587398307841 @nishio]: I started a 7-day trial of Palmy just in time for the date change, and I've already done the "Oh, really?" thing 3 times, so it's a free trial. I've already had three "Oh, I see" sessions, so I'm getting a lot out of this free trial. My wife advised me to write it on a sticky note and put it on my PC right now.
　Crysta stands for CLIP STUDIO PAINT
　The style of "painting a picture by layering many fine lines" that I had assumed is not a good idea because it is time-consuming and slow.
　 What did I misunderstand, or did I overgeneralize the pencil drawing method?
　Trying to stop the line at the goal slows it down and makes it dirty, so the goal is penetrated.

[Folder overwrite content disappearance issue]
　After a night's sleep, the deleted 0915 and 0916 were restored.
　　However, as expected from the results of the experiment at hand, the behavior is that "the contents of 0916 are overwritten by 0917," so the lost data is in 0917.
　2468 folders in 0917
　Folder 4197 of 0914
　Deletion of 0916 23:12 on 17th
　Deletion of 0915, 16th 21:25
　First, make a backup of 14 and 17 at this time.
　Rewind this folder."

		The move is taking place.

　The folder is being deleted before the move takes place.

		I see that you can specify the restore point by looking at the file operations performed instead of specifying the time of day, which is convenient.

		I could rewind.

　I saw it halfway through.

　Huh? Your hands are much easier to move even though it's only been a day?

　Photo tracing.

It seems like a good idea to keep it simple and do the beginner's stuff without taking any tall courses.

I heard the second day of the course and went back to day one.

　Okay, I'm not very good at "slightly curved curves".
