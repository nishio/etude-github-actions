centralization of power
	Assume the status quo is [centralized].
	Often people think that there are all kinds of problems with centralized things, so let's make something decentralized.
	But that centralized structure wasn't there from the beginning.
	From a decentralized state came its centralized structure.
	We'll call this "centralization."
	Since centralization happened in the past, if you create something new and decentralized now, it will also become centralized.
	We need to determine why centralization happened and stop its causes.

After listening to the presentation on creating a non-centralized platform at the Unexplored Achievement Reporting Conference 2018, I was talking with [Sokawa] at the cafe and heard him point out that even if you create a non-centralized service, centralization within it can occur, so I took notes because it was an eye opener.

Principle 1
	[Network effects] exist.
	A network that grows to a certain size grows even larger.
	An oligopoly by a single network will occur.
â†’This could be a pattern of "an oligopoly by a single network has occurred, but that network is operated de-centrally rather than by a specific operator". Isn't the network effect independent of centralization for the users of the network?

Principle 2
	There is positive feedback [the rich get richer and richer] ([Matthew Effect])
	Resource oligopoly occurs

Principle 3
	There is no power to balance resource bias (a natural assumption if no centralized entity is assumed to exist).
	Resource bias occurs naturally: see [not a natural occurrence of disparity].
