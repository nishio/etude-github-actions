 *1335925211*Alloy Code Reading
 - There is a class called PNGWriter and I don't see it in the Visualizer menu, so where do I output from? I found that right-clicking on the screen brings up a menu for outputting as PNG or PDF.
 - I found a sample in alloy4whole to handle it from the command line. Easy.
 - Module world = CompUtil.parseEverything_fromFile(rep, null, filename);
 - A4Solution ans = TranslateAlloyToKodkod.execute_command(rep, world.getAllReachableSigs(), command, options);
 - ans.satisfiable()
 - ans.writeXML("alloy_example_output.xml");
 - viz.loadXML("alloy_example_output.xml", true);
 - If the current ans is satisfiable, ans.next() will get the next instance.
 - I think I can get a GraphViewer from vis.getViewer(), and from there I can use GraphViewer#alloySaveAsPNG to convert it to an image.
 - I was able to easily create a tool that runs from the command line and outputs all the solutions in a sequentially numbered XML file. This is what I wanted. I'm happy and satisfied.
 - As for the imaging, I held off because of the hassle of opening the window and all that.
