It takes more than 100 sheets to really understand the KJ method.
He said that to really understand the KJ method, you need experience in putting together 100 or more labels. This matches Nishio's personal realization.

> Even in individual work, when the number of labels is small, beginners fall under the illusion that they have done a good job, even if they have to cheat. However, when the number of labels reaches 100 or more, it is impossible for a beginner to do so with his or her own good sense. In other words, there is no deception. There is no other way but to listen to what the data says and summarize it. This means a great deal of rigor, but it is a good way to learn, and it is a good opportunity to really understand the KJ method. ([Let the chaos speak for itself] p.211)

In The Engineer's Art of Intellectual Production, on p. 147, he writes that you should try the writing out method with a goal of 100 sheets, and if you don't come up with 100 sheets, you are probably not gathering enough information.

I used to demand that even first-time experiencers do it in 100 sheets, but I've come to think that 25 sheets might be fine as a real first step. First of all, I need [the experience of accomplishing one job] at a minimal cost.
