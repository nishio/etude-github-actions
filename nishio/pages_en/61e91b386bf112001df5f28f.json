compare
I use the word especially to show [analogy]. In many cases, I compare similar things to describe what I want to say. It is good to find patterns. See [(0.2.2) Compare and find patterns].

However, there are also differences. I described this pattern of thinking on [(1.5.1.3) Focus on the difference].
