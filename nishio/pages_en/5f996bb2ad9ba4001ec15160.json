Kruskal method
	Algorithm for finding the [minimum global tree] of an undirected connected graph
	O(E log E)
　Add the cost of the sides from the cheapest to the least expensive to avoid creating a closed channel.
　　This closed path can be determined in almost constant time by using [UnionFind
　　O(E log E) where the edges are sorted by cost.
　　　O(E) if sorted or able to [linear time sort)
