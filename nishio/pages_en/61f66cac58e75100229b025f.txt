prudence

Supreme prudence.
xcvi 

It is the throne of reason and the foundation of prudence. By its means, success can be obtained with little sacrifice. It is a gift from heaven and should be prayed for as the first and best quality. It is the main part of the universal garment and is so important that without it man would be incomplete, whereas with other qualities it is simply a matter of more or less. All actions in life depend on the utilization of this quality, and everything needs the help of this quality. Discretion consists of a combination of a natural inclination toward the most rational path and a preference for the most certain one.
