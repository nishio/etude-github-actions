remote collaboration
	Tacit knowledge that is not verbalized is shared through collaboration.
 [SECI Model]
 There is a well-known misconception that "communalization" means physically getting together.
 	The image is generalized because of famous examples of implementation, such as camps
 The key element for tacit knowledge sharing to occur is "being able to observe the behavior of others.
 Before the development of ICT technology, "being able to observe the behavior of others" = "being in the same place".

	Even remote areas can benefit from co-location.
 	Of course, being in the same place is more informative.
  but the cost of creating a state of being in the same place is also high.
  Taking low-cost measures as a small start is also an option.

	Example
 	Multiple remote people working on a project with a high degree of discretion
  Able to observe actions taken by a person (e.g., tools chosen at discretion, people contacted, etc.)
  There is learning for the participants.
