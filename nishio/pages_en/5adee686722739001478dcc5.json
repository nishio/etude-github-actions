Write task notes on iPad
2018-04-24
	I used to write [task memos] on [Rhodia].
 	It is in the breast pocket for quick access, so you can write as soon as you think of it.
  But A7 size
   There is a 5mm square and I write 5mm letters.
   If you write a lot, it will be small letters written in small pieces.
   	Or it would be multiple copies.
   not good
  My wife says she writes on A5 size paper, about 1cm square.
 Since we have the iPad, we should make ample use of its wide screen to organize tasks.
  Can write larger than Rhodia
  Unlike paper, it can be moved and copied and pasted after writing.
	have a go
 	Write anything without separating it from the task.
  INBOX equivalent
 	Every day it shrinks a little bit.
  Every day we change the placement two-dimensionally, or a new sprout grows.
