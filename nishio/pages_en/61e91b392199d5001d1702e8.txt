(4.3.2.2) value of reading is the product of three power
Terada Masatsugu thinks that the value of reading is the product of three powers:

> "author's power" × "your experience points" × "your business power."

You spend the time to read books. It is an investment. The efficiency of the investment is the value per time.

That says the value of reading is not determined only by the contents of books. To read much does not mean to get much value.

"Your experience points" is a metaphor of role-playing games. By collecting the experience points, the ability of the in-game character grows. For reading, there are three abilities:

 the ability to collect useful information from books
 the ability to recall your experiences including information you learned before
 the ability to build models based on your experiences and information from books

"Your business capability" includes "ability to collect information from customers" and "ability to assemble models to understand customers' needs based on experience and information" and " Make and show it to customers and verify their understanding."

"Your business strength" is also a set of ability.

 the ability to collect information from customers
 the ability to build the model of customer needs, based on your experiences and information from customers
 the ability to make [products that likely to meet customer needs]
 the ability to deliver the products to customers and verify your understanding of needs

Footnote:

	You need verification of whether you can make products that likely to meet customer needs.
	To come up with products that you can make, you need a model of technical knowledge inside of you.
