  WebDB Press General Information
  	In short, the idea is to use a compilation of technical magazines to cover the following problems: when you want to look up something technical, Googling is noisy, school libraries are too old, and if you are in the city, you can hang around at Junkudo, which is well-stocked with technical books, but there are no such bookstores in the countryside.
   I was going to write an explanation of how to Google, and I thought that if you search for general keywords, you'll find a lot of garbage, so I figured I'd put in technical keywords, and then I thought, "No, how do I find those keywords?
   You can use it to look at the table of contents and find keywords, and since there are about 100 magazines in electronic form, it's an amazing value just to search!
