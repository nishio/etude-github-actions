 The ranking was somehow in fourth place, so I moved it back to second place.
 Its last play.

 It was one of those games that made me think that life can be good if you don't give up, and when it got to 24 points I thought there was no way to win, but I got lucky and we won.
 
 By the way, at the RECENT GAMES section, it now shows how many points I scored in that game, which shows that I won 6 out of 10 games. This is my ability.

 I thought the average score would be capped at about 0.6, but some people are 0.93.

 I feel very energetic today compared to yesterday and the day before.
 Maybe it was because I ate a lot of vegetables, or maybe it was because I walked about two kilometers and slept soundly for about five hours.
 Maybe the line, "Man is an animal and must move" is still true. Perhaps programmers have an unnatural job as animals.

 <body>It would be nice to be able to program while moving. The problem is that I can't think without blocking out information from my surroundings. </body> <body>
