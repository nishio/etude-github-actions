 *1201316319* Oh no!
 I didn't print out the map to the SoozyConference kayak tomorrow.
 ...I think I'll leave early and stop by the lab to print it out before I go.
 
 *1201317331* Complete hash function
 Hash function - Wikipedia

 GNU gperf is software that calculates the complete hash function from a set of strings, taking the elements of the set as input.

 *1201353414* It's only 10am.
 
 Very sleepy.
 I wonder if I should continue or stop writing the Jayson book.
 Ahhh.
 It would be a lot easier if we just threw it all away.
 
 **1201356312*About Python and one-liners
 I said "I also write a little Python, about one line" and it didn't go through, so I'll put it up again as a self-introduction.
 
 Yasukazu Nishio's Blog: One-liners are the dark side. You should include line breaks.
 --http://www.nishiohirokazu.org/blog/2007/08/post_323.html
 
 I wonder if "how we make writing orgs" is more recognizable these days. Either one or the other.

 PS: Sometimes people seem to mistake me for a one-liner proponent, but it's the opposite.
 Yasukazu Nishio's Blog: Know-how on creating one-liners in Python
 --http://www.nishiohirokazu.org/blog/2006/08/python_12.html
 Compared to this, the above calendar output code is short and very simple and easy to understand, with no infinite loop or exception handling. So, if someone says, "Anything is fine as long as it works," I would be happy to give them this calendar code and have them maintain it.
 
 
 
 Or you can have this maintained. This is not a one-liner, the tests are tightly written, and the code is simple and uncluttered. The function names are minimal.

 *1201360430*3D Test Broadcast
 http://www.bs11.jp/?action_public_pgm_detail=true&cid=1&pid=28
 >>
 Japan BS Broadcasting Corporation aims to promote and expand the use of "3D stereoscopic broadcasting," which allows viewers to appreciate stereoscopic images in their living rooms.
 To this end, the program will explain how 3D stereoscopic broadcasting works and provide the latest information on the technology.
 In addition, an actual 3D stereoscopic broadcast will be played for approximately 6 minutes during the program.
 (omitted)
 A 3D-compatible TV and special glasses are required to view the images as stereoscopic images.

 I was talking about this at the reception, this.

 <body>I'm responding without reading the spec, but I think you mean that Func2 is faster because it can assign all arguments and local variables to registers</body>.

 <body>I did a little searching on ActionDefineFunction2, is it like up to 255 local variables can be put in a register, so the cost is lower when accessing them? </body>

 <username>yossy44</username>
 <body>Yes. As for register operations, there are dedicated opcodes available for very fast read/write. (since you don't have to subtract the hash)</body>.
