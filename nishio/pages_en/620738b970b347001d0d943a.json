Do not be paradoxical in avoiding nonsense
cxliii
We must not be paradoxical in order to avoid nonsense.

Both extremes ruin our reputation. Every undertaking that strays from reason approaches folly. Paradox is a deception, at first applauded for its novelty and fun, but later discredited when the deception is seen through and its emptiness is revealed. This is a kind of juggling act, and in political matters it can ruin a nation. Those who cannot or dare not reach great deeds by following the path of excellence will follow the path of a paradox that is admired by fools but a true prophet to the wise. It insists on unbalanced judgments, which, if not based entirely on falsehood, are certainly based on uncertainty and endanger the more important issues of life.
