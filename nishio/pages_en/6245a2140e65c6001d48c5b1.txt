>3. "Sufficiently list and research similar ideas" The most important part of "3. The most important part of "3. Similar ideas are well enumerated and researched" is "By researching the ideas in the world and then asking yourself why you want to formulate them, the idea you want to create will become more sophisticated. I guess that's it.
>[dmikurube https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1509500825252507654]: while there is no value in a mere one-sided critique that "something similar is already out there," there is no value in a mere one-sided critique by an evaluator or expert that says "I asked myself this question, I did it right. ?" by an evaluator or an expert. Well, I think it is necessary to nail down the latter, because it is the most depressing to be a know-it-all by the former who thinks he is the latter....

I have been involved in this for several years, and I think it is quite serious, especially in the comparison part, and I emphasize it.

>[dmikurube https://twitter.com/dmikurube/status/1509504914015555587]: I see... I wonder if it is a generational tendency that "[being asked a question is considered] wrong". I don't have much direct experience with that generation, so I don't know, but if that's the case, I wonder if there are different points to pay attention to in communication...

I hope the message of "why are you asking/doing such questions" will be spread properly. I support your activities!

>[YoshifumiSeki https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1509512544524042241]: thank you! Definitely yes, and I would like to increase the number of people who can [discuss, not criticize]!
