A case study in the context of how [information transfer] has become more efficient with the development of [technology].
	Some people may be concerned now because of the negative things that have happened as it has become more efficient, but [technology is] neutral, and it can be good or bad depending on how you use it.
	As technology makes human behavior more efficient, human behavior with bad intentions also becomes more efficient, and evil is done efficiently.
		The only way to combat this is for people with good intentions to become equally efficient.
		Even if you try to bind them with [ethics] or [laws], people with bad intentions will ignore them.
