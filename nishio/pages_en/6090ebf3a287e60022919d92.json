 *1195959813* When you wake up.
 
 Surprise in Nagatacho.
 
 *1195960627*Lab attached.
 At least we avoided the story of the venue provider being a sleeper.
 
 *1195973254*Memo.

 - Iri kawa, iri...kawa, iri...
 - Prettyprinting lambda makes my wife by hayamizu (fake)
 -- Let me explain, prettyprint means to print prettily!
 - hayamizu's wife went home to her parents
 - S <- "a" S "a" does not match "aaaaa".
 -- Maybe "middle recursion" isn't intuitive to begin with. And I don't use it.
 - Introduce cut operator
 -- A ↑ B / C does not try C if it matches A
 -- "class" ↑ Identifier / "interface" ...
 -- When ↑ appears, the possibility of backtracking before A disappears, so the note can be discarded.
 -- I think you're using the wrong notation. cond(("class", Identifier), ("interface", Identifier), ...) Why don't you just create a matcher with the following notation?
 -- If we are drawn to the PEG notation, we are likely to make a design that should essentially be an n-term operator with a binary operation by mistake.
 --- Is that the solution with the S formula?
 - binary parser generator
 -- It also considers endianness and takes only matched values, easy description! I'm sure you'll be able to do that.

 --- As expected of Erlang, it is very strong.
 -- I'll write here that TAKESAKO is probably making a Perl version on Monday (reckless).
 - MEMETA☆Rangageji
 -- I was astonished at how short it was when I wrote the KEMURI interpreter in Haskell and when I read the processors written in OCaml in Unlambda. When measured by Unlambda in terms of language creation, OCaml is about twice as productive as Scheme and five times as productive as Perl.
 --- It's amazing that OCaml is much shorter than Scheme with call/cc and OCaml without call/cc.
 - Not a hash, but a ring <del>list</del><ins>buffer</ins>.
 -- Rats!<del>is also like that</del><ins> is an array of column objects</ins>.
 -- Cannot be left to GC. Reuse it yourself.
 - In Perl7, the grammar itself can be changed so that there is more than one way to do it.
 - New Regular Expression Library in ACL7.0
 -- http://jp.franz.com/base/seminar/2004-06-10/Franz1.pdf
 - Perl6 Rules (new regular expressions)
 -- http://www9.ocn.ne.jp/~ymt/perl6/rules.html
 --- The theory that it is a type of PEG
 -  o memoize x memorize
 -- Memoizu
 --- What is the French reading of "Memowaisu"?
 - ujihisa: "I brought a lost nyaniko home the next day from college."
 -- Rear Counselor, "Hi-Hi, Wallace Wallace."
 - hayamizu, "Lost lambda in college brought home the next day."
 -- λWife: "Do you want to have dinner? Or bath?"
 --- hayamizu "you" -> serious error occurred
 - If we view memoization as a cache, we can reuse the various studies that have been done to improve the efficiency of the cache.
 -- the higher the cost of generation, the more likely it is to remain in the cache?
 
 - Know-how in distributing study groups
 -- Materials on a black background are easier to view via Ustream (compared to a white background).
 -- Place the whiteboard high enough to prevent lighting from reflecting on the whiteboard
 -- Mounting the camera on a chair with casters is nice for smooth movement
 --- but cables on the floor are in the way.
 -- The sound on ustream was perfect thanks to the voice recorder microphone that hayamizu brought in. hayamizu++.
 
 I'm still trying to sort it all out.
 
 I'm not fully organized, but it's already 11pm. It's Sunday, so I might lose the last train. Let's go home.
 
 *1196000764*Last train
 
 It was.
 
 Privately owned trains.
 Female train.
 City-owned trains, is normal.
 
 *1196007176* How to write org.
 It seems to be a popular practice these days for someone to put a minus sign on a subject and someone else to set it back to zero. Interesting. I've heard of "minus rating," "unfair minus rating," "minus rating," "unfair minus rating."
 
 Anonymous negative ratings are very weak.
 If you have something to appeal to, put it into words.
 If it is a worthwhile opinion, it will be positively evaluated.

 <body>Would it be interesting to sort by sum of absolute scores=controversial points? (I guess we don't have enough scoring data for that yet.) </body>
