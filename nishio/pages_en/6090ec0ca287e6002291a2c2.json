 *1381763865* Bought ginger syrup.
 I bought "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B000MJNDWG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=B000MJNDWG& linkCode=as2&tag=nishiohirokaz-22">Organic Cordial Ginger 500ml</a>" was 20% off on Amazon, so I bought it. I am a very hot-headed person when it comes to ginger, and I like Wilkinson's for ginger ale and Udon-Ya-fu Ichiyaku for ginger candies. Most commercial ginger tea is not enough for me, so I add a tube of ginger.
 
 This ginger syrup is supposed to be diluted 10 times. The ingredients are cane sugar, lemon juice, and ginger. When I actually diluted it and drank it, I first felt the freshness of lemon and then the spiciness of ginger. I liked it so much that I drank half of it during the three-day weekend.
 
 I tried mixing it with Koap Garana and Lifeguard, but it turned out to be kind of interesting, especially with Lifeguard. If you like the peculiar taste of root beer or something like that, you might want to give it a try.
