Trust and Human Network
[Trust] and [human networks]
	There are a certain amount of people in the world who can't be [trusted].
	It's hard to live with having to constantly question others.
	If [the community] is composed only of people who can be trusted, [the cost of suspicion] is eliminated, and it is more efficient.
	However, just one [scammer] comes in and they all become [suckers].
	So [create a network of trusted people].
		Trust the people in your network.
		Be careful when adding people who are not here.
		People who are found to be in trouble are removed from the network.
	Networks are layered, with more networks added as they are trusted.

			As for "Option B," here's how he explains it[nishio.icon].
				>Various negative labels tend to be applied to this way of thinking, such as "voracious," "con artist," "psychopath without empathy," "egocentric," etc., but that does not solve the problem.
