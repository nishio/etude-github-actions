Human Network Building Algorithm
Algorithm for building [human networks
#TODO Write a detailed explanation
roughly
	Create lots of small groups (communities, 30 people at most)
  Each group is not treacherous.
  Not all are formal organizations.
  	Encourage [informal organizations] to feel free to make
  Not everything is public.
   Some "gateway" communities can be large or public
 Encourage membership in more than one group ref. [parallel work].
 Information on selfish players is spread to other communities by members belonging to multiple groups
  This causes [the destruction of the prisoner's dilemma by placing an observer] and facilitates a mutually beneficial community.
 If the informal organization is not performing well, participants quickly leave and flee to another group
  Groups that generate [mutually beneficial] behavior will survive, while communities ravaged by [selfish] players will disappear.
  Can cleanse itself without explicitly KICKING selfish players

	Q: Just having a small group of people did not work. With each passing day, fewer and fewer people joined.
 	A: I don't know the details of the situation, but I guess there was no incentive design for contributing to the group
  	In a properly rotating small group, members act for the benefit of the other members of the group, thereby benefiting from the members' membership in the group.
   Therefore, there is an incentive to continue to belong to this group.
