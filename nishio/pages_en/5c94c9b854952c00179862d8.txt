Bracketing Anywhere
Scrapbox's link suggestions are useful, but I don't know how to plug a suggestion target in there.
Why don't you make a whole suggestion?
Watch for focused textarea with Chrome extension
If `[` is entered, search for that string as a key.

Then you can have [bracketed] input suggestions on all services that have Textarea, not just Scrapbox.

Conversely, if we create an extension that makes the bracketed area in the body a link to Scrapbox...
