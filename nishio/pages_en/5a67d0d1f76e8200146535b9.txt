a wise man keeps some of his talents in reserve

 Evaluation is a matching opportunity
 Where [opportunity] changes from 0 to 1, [utility] changes significantly.
  You get the opportunity = [selected].
  Opportunity selects people.
 Even where the opportunity changes from 1 to 2, it would seem to simply increase utility.
  Actually, it consumes a limited resource called "[time]" and cannot be acquired infinitely.
 People who are given a lot of opportunities will conversely make selections that leave good opportunities and discard others.
  Opportunities are selected by people

　I think there are many people who do not understand how it is related, so I will give a supplemental explanation.
　　In some cases, showing fingernails in the early stages of one's career gives one an advantage over "those who cannot show their fingernails" when it comes to matching opportunities.
　　On the other hand, more opportunity is not always better, because the time available to an individual is finite.
　　So, a "skilled hawk" who has had enough opportunities will no longer need to show his claws.
