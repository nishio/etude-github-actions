Fragments and Systems
Some have asked, "What is [systematic knowledge]?"
I think the synonym is "[fragmented knowledge]."

[Fragmentary]
[Systematic]
[Fragment]
[System]

What connects the fragments
　connection
　Associative connections
　(strongly emphatic) not ...
　Maybe "seemingly contradictory" is important.
　　The unthinking person asks, "Which is right?" or, again, they assume the one they saw first is right and ignore the one that came later.
　　[Dialectic]
