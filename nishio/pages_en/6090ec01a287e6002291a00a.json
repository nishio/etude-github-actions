 You are only looking at irrelevant sites as a result of a loss of concentration, so just because you didn't look at irrelevant sites doesn't mean that you are maintaining the necessary concentration.

 I see!
 
 **1253287935*Memorandum of Consideration for Task
 Suppose you register a repetitive task to build a habit. Naturally, you will not suddenly succeed 100% of the time. When unsuccessful tasks accumulate on the list, the action of looking at the task list is associated with the negative feeling of "Oh, I failed. This further weakens the behavior of checking the task list.
 
 Repeated tasks to build habits should disappear on their own when the deadline is exceeded. When you click the checkbox, the number of consecutive accomplishments is displayed as "2 Combo!" or something like that. You can separately look at the number of accomplishments so far and say, "I'm almost at 100! but the percentage of achievement should not be displayed. However, the percentage of achievement should not be displayed. The percentage of achievement triggers a strong negative feeling of "I'm not at 100% anymore" at the moment of the first failure. Once it is no longer 100%, it cannot be recovered. Even if a combo is broken, it can be continued from the next day. The number of accomplishments will not decrease, but will keep piling up.
 
 There must be a task that has already become a habit. How did it become a habit?
 
 **1253296327*Universal access on the Mac makes a glaring black on white site look okay.
 Oh, I can display a black on white site in black and white. This is good.
 
 
 I thought it would be a good idea, but it seems to simply invert the colors, so the editor I normally use in black and white is now black on white. It makes no sense. I wish it would look at the window area and determine if there are more light or dark colors.
