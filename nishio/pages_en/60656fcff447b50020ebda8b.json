	🤔Make a menu (Make Read-only Copy) that copies the current map and returns it's read-only link
		The work process can be shared with the reader in a form that can be zoomed rather than scrubbed.

I just noticed that the current system for organizing in Regroup is
	Save as New map at the appropriate time
	古い方のRead-only URLを発行する
and then you can share it with your readers in a way that they can zoom in, not just squish it.

This way, you can foresee accidents where an editor edits a past snapshot mistaking it for the latest version.
therefore
	Save as New map at the appropriate time
	それのRead-only URLを発行する
	Add a Read-only flag on the edit permission URL side as well, preventing inadvertent editing by making it impossible to write unless explicitly removed.
should it be?

And it would be nice to be able to do these 3 steps in one menu like "Make Read-only Copy".

🤔Add Read-only flag to edit permission URL
　This is for "not inadvertently editing"
　　That thing with the floppy disk (a metaphor not conveyed to young people)
　　[Flag to avoid inadvertent editing].
　　Can be attached or detached if you have editing privileges.
　　　🤔Read-only flag on/off menu
🤔Make Read-only Copyメニューを作る
　What URL is returned to the user when Make Read-only Copy is done?
　　If the edit permission URL is changed, it is the same as the current "Save as New map".
　　　So this implementation is not happening.
　　If the read-only URL is changed, there is no way to edit it by mistake in the first place.
　　If in the future you have user management and can see the list of maps you have created, you may be able to get an edit permission link after the fact.
　　　Currently that is not planned.
  　then the Read-only flag is currently not necessary
 Just need a "copy it and return it's lead-only link menu"?
