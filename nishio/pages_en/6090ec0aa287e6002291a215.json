 *1334499700*Story of getting stuck on Validate for registration to AppStore.
 When I Validate, I get this error message and cannot proceed.

 No suitable application records were found
 Please make sure that you have set up a record for this application on iTunes Connect.

 I thought 'prepare for upload' was waiting for upload, but I was mistaken, it was a trap that I had to be 'waiting for upload' by answering questions such as not using encryption.
 
 Not in this state:

 It has to be this way:

 *1334500461*Icon size when registering apps for iPad in AppStore
 I took a quick look at "How are the icon files in my application bundle used on iPad and iPhone?" and figured 57x57 is Riquired, so I made an app.

 However, when I Validate, I get angry.

 I wondered why, and re-reading the table carefully, I found that it says "iPhone-only Apps"....
 
 If you go to the bottom, there is a table for the iPad-only case and a table for both cases. The conclusion was that both 57x57 and 72x72 were needed to support both.
