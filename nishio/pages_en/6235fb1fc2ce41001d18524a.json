Allies for Beginners

The effect of the alliance is a workshop with 2 Favers. if there is a way to earn Favers, I wonder if a workshop garden is possible.
Maybe he's a mediator and destroys the deception.

　Oh, no, it's not compatible with the garden due to the relationship between destroying it and creating friendship.

　Strong when the vassal chain is connected.
　　It's hard to dispose of the initial deck with a mediator.
　　AI has come a long way.
　　Need more action in the capital.
　　Sailing to gain more turns
　　If you want to get an additive chain, you don't buy treasures, but that makes it hard to put in a 5-cost card.
　　　Coin the destruction of the intermediary.
　　Acquisition of 5-cost cards in undersea treasures

　First hand, intermediary, and deception.
　Acquire a mediator, destroy the sesame and coin it, and capital
　　That's a good start.
　Would you rather draw on a map than have three mediators? Destroy the mansion and buy the capital

Winning the game by scoring 27 points in one turn against a 21-point opponent.
　Bought 2 gardens 2 copper coins 3 in Gushu.
　(Well, the score difference was 3 points, so I could have won simply by buying two genshu.)

looking back
　Basically a vassal chain
　To achieve this, the action ratio needs to be high, but the only discarded card is the mediator, so what to do about this situation
　First move: Sesame Street, mediator. Gain a mediator through the power of alliances.
　After 2 rounds
　　When the mediator destroys the mansion or the sesame seed, he changes it to coins and takes the 5-cost capital.
　　Draw with old maps, increasing the probability that intermediaries will overlap with discarded material.
　　Precursor if there is nothing else to buy for 3 coins.
　　Buy undersea treasures and acquire capitals and markets.
　　Once we have enough room for action, we will increase the number of vassals.
　　　The terminal action, mediators and renovations, are not actively included.
　　　Should I not buy sesame seeds because of the possibility of an outburst in the vassal?
　　　Vassals can choose to use it or not.

AI also does Distant Shore and Garden.

I think you have to play a lot to converge, but with random matching, it's a bit more subtle because it takes longer depending on who you're playing with...
