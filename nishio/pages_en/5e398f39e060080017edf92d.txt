Card view of URL?
	[Embedly] could do it.
		Ease of copying and pasting is compromised.
 	Should the text be put up as written?
 	I still want the image to unfold.
 	Wouldn't you be happy to see oembed expanded in the export tool?
 	Would you rather have a bookmarklet that clips the selection with the source?
