 There is a misconception that the nondiscrimination curve is convex to origin, but this is only true when assuming the model of "[the law of diminishing marginal utility]" at the time the nondiscrimination curve was proposed, and there are known experimental cases in which this is not true.
 Nobel economist Samuelson already wrote about concave indifference curves in 1956
