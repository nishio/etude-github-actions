On the word card, you write a question on the front and the answer on the back. Prepare multiple boxes and set a review interval that gradually becomes longer, such as 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 1 month, for each box.",

You review cards that you already remember at long intervals. The review interval is automatically adjusted.",
