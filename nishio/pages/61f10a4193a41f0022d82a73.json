For example, in the case you have only one evaluator and you are trying to get a job by appealing your ability to that person, if you show a poor quality product, you can not get another chance. This is the difference between a situation where repeated experiments are possible and a situation where you can only try once. The methodology of experimental science presupposes a situation where repeated experiments are possible. If you can only make one attempt, you need to make hard decisions in the trade-off between your chances of being accepted and the effort you put into the appeal.",
