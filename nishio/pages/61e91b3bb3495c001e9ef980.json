It is frequently happens that a seminar takes five hours and we go ahead only one line in the book. It is OK. The professor does not get angry with it. He gets angry when we say \"I understand it\" to the concept which we do not understand. It is similar to the debugging of a program. We gradually increase the fact that is absolutely correct.",
