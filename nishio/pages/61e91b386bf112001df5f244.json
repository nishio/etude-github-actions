First, prepare a columnar aquarium. Prepare a scaffold with a diameter of 10 cm in this. Since the scaffold is 1 cm below the surface of the water and the water is opaque, the rat does not know where the scaffold is. (*6)",

In contrast, rats with broken the hippocampas failed to learn the location of the scaffold. (*7)",
