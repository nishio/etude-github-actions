There are over 1,000 provisions in the Civil Code in Japan. Grasping everything in detail is difficult. On the other hand, when discussing something, you need to refer the related articles. So you need to know where those articles are.",

The difference is the form of information. The information is drawn like a tree so that you can find the upper and lower layers immediately. Also, it is one large paper so that you can see the whole information without turning the page.",
