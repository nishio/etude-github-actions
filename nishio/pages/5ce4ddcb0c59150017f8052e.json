Kawakita had an enormous influence on Western thinking on management, and the KJ method has been adopted as the 'affinity diagram'. I think this term needs to be included, and I think a brief explanation should be given about how the KJ method is used in project management and in management in general, and then how it can be adapted to writing - which is what you did. So I think Westerners need to know how much the KJ method has already been adopted in western thought. I'm not expressing myself well here.",
