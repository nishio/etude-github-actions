A range which includes an uncertain value with a certain probability is called a confidence interval. For example, in the case a value X is in the range of 10 to 20 with 95% probability, we express it that 95% confidence interval of X is 10 to 20. The upper confidence bound points to the larger boundary of this confidence interval. In this example, it is 20. Let's take a look at the diagram.",
