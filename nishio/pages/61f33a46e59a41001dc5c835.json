Let's say you are suffering from a college freshman and wondering, 'It is correct to learn programming language X'. If you do a scientific approach, you will repeat learning a few times and repeat what you do not learn a few times and compare which is better. But you can not do such an experiment alone. You can only learn or do not learn one time.",
