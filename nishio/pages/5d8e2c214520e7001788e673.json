To produce other things, or the same things by a different method, means to combine these materials and forces differently. In so far as the “[new combination]” may in time grow out of the old by continuous adjustment in small steps, there is certainly change, possibly growth, but neither a new phenomenon nor development in our sense. In so far as this is not the case, and the new combinations appear discontinuously, then the phenomenon characterising development emerges. For reasons of expository convenience, henceforth, we shall only mean the latter case when we speak of new combinations of productive means. Development in our sense is then defined by the carrying out of new combinations.",

(2) The [introduction of a new method of production], that is one not yet tested by experience in the branch of manufacture concerned, which need by no means be founded upon a discovery scientifically new, and can also exist in a new way of handling a commodity commercially. (3) The [opening of a new market], that is a market into which the particular branch of manufacture of the country in question has not previously entered, whether or not this market has existed before. (4) The [conquest of a new source of supply] of raw materials or half-manufactured goods, again irrespective of whether this source already exists or whether it has first to be created. (5) The [carrying out of the new organisation] of any industry, like the creation of a monopoly position (for example through trustification) or the breaking up of a monopoly position.",
