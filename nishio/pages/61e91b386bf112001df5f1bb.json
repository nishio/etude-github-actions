It seemed to be good for making a leverage note. However, Tumblr provides a function \"reblog\" to copy and re-post the posts of others. By this function, Tumblr shows the same post repeatedly. I felt bored and thought that keeping the same content was a bad idea. I did not understand its value at the time. Later, with the advent of similar features like Twitter's \"retweet\" and Facebook's \"share,\" I finally realized that this function was not for knowledge creation but information propagation.",
