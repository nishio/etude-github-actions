However, if stimulated four times at short intervals, long-term potentiation lasts about 28 hours. The shorter the duration is called \"[Early LTP],\" the longer one is called the \"[Late LTP].\" Interestingly, by chemicals that inhibit protein synthesis, the early LTP is not affected, and only late LTP hindered.",
