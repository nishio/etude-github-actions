For example, trying to remember similar English words like \"adapt\" and \"adopt\" at the same time, you may confuse and answer the meaning of the other word. In that case, you need to improve the cards or remove them. You may think that simply removing them makes it impossible to remember those words. However, you can not remember either unless you remove them. The result is the same. Japanese proverbs say, \"If a person who follows two rabbits at the same time, he catches no rabbits.\" If you can not improve the cards, you can only remove them.",
