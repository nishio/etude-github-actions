Type T has both a wide range of knowledge and a speciality in one field. Type Pi(π) has multiple specialties. It is argued that it is important not to deepen knowledge only with a narrow specialty field, but also to have broad interest in peripheral fields and completely different fields, not to be bound by the frame of expertise.

If the physical distance between you and Alice is one meter, and the distance between you and Bob is one meter, then the distance between Alice and Bob is always less than two meters. This is called a triangle inequality. However, when it comes to the distribution of knowledge, it is possible to go from a situation where the distance between Alice and Bob is as if they are one kilometer apart, to a situation where the distance becomes much closer when a person such called an interpreter or translator who can communicate with both of them steps in between.
