      "text": "Another advice for people with messy rooms is \"make a base first.\" I appreciate this advice. Since it takes much time to tidy up the whole room,  you partition the area first and make only one place tidy. The word \"base\" means a settled area. By acquiring the base, you feel [accomplishment]. By having the base, your daily work becomes more efficient. The efficiency brings you a surplus time that you can use to maintain and improve your base. You can gradually improve the base and enlarge it. (*5)",

So you need to partition the area first. What area is important for your daily work? It is the area \"to do today.\" Let's partition your tasks whether it is to do today or not. Concentrate on organizing the base: things to do today. (*6)",
