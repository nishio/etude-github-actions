Even with only two tasks, it is not so easy because there are multiple evaluation axes and uncertainties.

Once your axis of values ​​is clarified, you can judge the importance of each task against that axis. The prioritization becomes possible after that. The prioritization is not a task to do now. By doing specific tasks in front of you, observing what task you like and what task makes you happy every day, eventually, you become being able to prioritize tasks.",
