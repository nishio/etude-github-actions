Here is what I do: I estimate how long a task should take, and then break that down into 20-minute units. Three such units add up to one hour, and this makes it easy to calculate my actual working hours at the end of the day, as 3 units equal one hour. It therefore doesn’t matter how long my breaks are [sometimes I need to pay attention to my daughter, or my cat is hungry, or my dogs need attention and my breaks are longer than the planned 5 or 10 minutes]. This means that the amount spent ‘at work’ is irrelevant, what is relevant is how much time was actually spent on a task.",

I think people should be encouraged to adjust the 25 minutes to either 20 minutes or 30 minutes – or stick to the 25-minute units if they wish, based on their own power of concentration and preferences, to make it easier to calculate, in ultimate units of hours, how much time they estimated, and how much time was actually spent. But this is just an additional thought.)",
