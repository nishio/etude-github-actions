Simple cards are easy to remember, and adjustment of the review interval works effectively. For example, when you remember only a part of the answer, you review it at short intervals including the part you already remembered. When you remember almost correctly, but there is a slight difference, you worry about whether you consider it as a correct answer or an incorrect answer. Those phenomena happen because the question on the card is not simple enough.",
