Twenty-five years later, many people carried smartphones, and they can access digital data at any time. In response to this situation, [Toshiyuki Masui], a user interface researcher, proposed an organizing method based on the use of digital data in 2013. It is called \"[clear folder organization method].\"",

He puts the document in the clear folder, and record the correspondence between that number and contents as digital data. He does not sort the folders. The folders are always kept in numerical order. In this way, you can find out the number of what you want to find by searching in the data. Suppose the number is 38, you can find number 38 from among the clear folders that are in numerical order. By managing information where the object is as digital data, you can search in it. It is an augmentation of the ability to find things by information processing technology.",
