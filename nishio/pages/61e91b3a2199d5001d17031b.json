A task list is a list of tasks. It should not contain a thing which is not a task. So before you put something in the task list, you need to judge whether it is a task or not. In GTD, we postpone the decision and collect [everything you care about]. We separate the gathering phases and the thinking phases so that we do not [do multiple tasks] at the same time.",
