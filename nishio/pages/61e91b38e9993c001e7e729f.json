For example, after learning many programming languages, you can understand a new programming language without Shakyo. In this situation, you feel that you can learn any language without Shakyo. You may think Shakyo works only for the initial phase of a career as a programmer, and since you already passed the phase, you do not need Shakyo. Some readers who are good at programming may feel that way right now.",

The basic element of the alloy program is a relation. The alloy is a language to describe models by declaring facts and relations. When trying to learn this language, I could not understand by reading the explanation of the book. I felt embarrassed that I could not understand because I was confident in my knowledge of programming languages. I remembered Shakyo and finally began to understand it by using Shakyo. I noticed that I had forgotten about Shakyo. Why I forgot it. By thinking it, I found out that I was not challenging a new field. Now I think important that to regularly challenge new fields that you do not understand without Shakyo.",
