In the first experiment, let's say that 971 is chosen, which is odd. This is an odd number. In the second experiment, the number 683 is chosen. This is also an odd number. If we repeat this experiment 100 times and all 100 times are odd, can we say that \"all prime numbers are odd\" is correct?",

This experiment continues to return the observation that it is \"odd\" until we choose 2 with a very low probability at \"Choose one prime at random\". If 2 is chosen and it is observed that \"there are also non-odd prime numbers\", we can conclude that \"all prime numbers are odd numbers\" is incorrect.
