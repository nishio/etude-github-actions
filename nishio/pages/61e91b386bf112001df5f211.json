The newly added question marked as \"learned\" after you correctly answered once and you correctly answered again after 10 minutes. If you make a wrong answer in one of the two tests, you are asked again in a minute. Cards that marked  \"learned\" is reviewed one day later. And after that, the intervals of reviews increase with the easiness factor (default value is 2.5).",
