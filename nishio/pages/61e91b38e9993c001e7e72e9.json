For example, a peacock male has a big tail, but this tail feather is useless for the peacock to survive. Why do you make such useless? There is a theory that it is because it has a large tail featuring that it functions as a [signal] to appeal that \"I have a high ability to gather food\" because much nutrition is needed to make a big tail. When the female chooses male, we can not directly observe the ability to collect food. So they decide it by tail feathers which are easy to observe. It is called \"[handicap theory].\"",

For example, in on-demand printing (*11), after the publisher receives an order for the book, only the necessary amount of book is printed and sold. By these cost reductions, publishers accept more publication plans than before. In these days, the paper book no longer works as a signal of quality. ",
