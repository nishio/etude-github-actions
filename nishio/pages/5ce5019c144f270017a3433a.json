I’ve been reading popular non-fiction books (Dave Asprey, David Allen, Ryan Holiday, etc.) and their tone facilitates easy reading. This is what I will emulate in order to attract the same target market. If you want, I could edit a section, using Track Changes, for you to see how I would change the text.",

I'm thinking here of writers whose tone and style I really like, such as Steven Pinker, Daniel Pink, Cal Newport, Laura Vanderkam. So please let me know if you want me to work on the tone and style.",
