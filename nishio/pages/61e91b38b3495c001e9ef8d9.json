      "text": "The importance of balancing creation and maintenance is easy to understand about individual decision making. However, about the decision of the organization, conservative choices are more likely to be chosen. Doing new things often corresponds to a failure. If you feel a strong fear of failure, you do not challenge the new stuff.  If you have to explain new ideas and convince your boss ahead of the action, you will avoid new ideas.",

Even if others ask you for an objective explanation, wait a moment. After seedling, in the phase of growing it, your thought obtains an objective explanation afterward. Being subjective and breaking the existing frame, this is necessary to make judgment more biased toward maintenance more creative.",
