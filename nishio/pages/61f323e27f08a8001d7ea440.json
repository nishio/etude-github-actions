Banach and Tarski of mathematicians proved that if we admitting that the choice axiom is correct, this sphere can be divided into four, two spheres of radius 1 can be made by rotating and combining two by two . In other words, when you rotate and combine it, the volume doubles. This is contrary to intuition.",
