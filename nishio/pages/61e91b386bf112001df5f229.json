The correct answer rate for the second input exceeds 90% in the case of 20 minutes or 1 day, while it is about 20% in the case of 6 months. In the former case, you feel \"I can answer 90%. I remember them well.\" It is a good feeling. In the latter case, you feel \"I forgot most of I learned 6 months ago.\" You feel sad. However, in the latter case, the result of the final test is better than the former. ",

However, we can not always study on the optimal interval. If you stick to optimal intervals, you feel failed and decrease motivation. The correct answer ratio goes down gently after the peak. So even if you forgot to review after the optimal one-month interval and you reviewed it after 6 months, the results of the test are better than when you review it in a day. I recommend you not to worry too much about the optimal interval.",
