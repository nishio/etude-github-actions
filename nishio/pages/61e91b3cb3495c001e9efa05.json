      "text": "Rule-based thought is easy to explain the reason for the decision to others. You can show a clear proposition that \"if the stem is straight, it is group 2.\" On the other hand, it is weak to noise. In this example, we can separate two groups with feature 4 clearly. However, if there is a noise on feature 4, the rule-based people think that there is no clear criterion to distinguish the two groups. They stop thinking. The thought is also weak to the situation that some of the features are unobservable. If they can not observe feature 4, they also stop thinking.",
