      "text": "It takes much time than we think. For example, in the case of the [bubble sort], we repeat looking at neighboring two items and move the task with the highest priority up. Suppose there are N items in the list, we need to compare values N ( N - 1) / 2 times. For N = 10, it is 45 times and for N = 100, it is 4950 times. If you can compare and rearrange two items in only 3 seconds, you can sort 10 items in 135 seconds, about 2 minutes. However, you need more than 4 hours to sort 100 items.",
