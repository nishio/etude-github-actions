We learned a similar concept in [(1.3.3) Learn roughly first]. The second half is an activity to prepare concrete question and read the book repeatedly. This activity is related to the effect that the test strengthens memory, which we learned in [(3.4.1) Test is a means of memorization]. To leave overnight is also likely to relate to a way to enhance memory by leaving the interval learned in [(3.5) Spaced repetition method that lasts knowledge].",

You read the book 10 times in total. On the whole, you spend more than two hours. So, for many people, this program does not shorten the time to read a book. This program is training to experience a change in the quality of reading. You learn the way of reading which iterates through the book 10 times rather than reading through the book only once.",
