The depth of processing is four stages, and subjects did one of them for each word. The first stage is \"processing of form\" that answer the question \"Is the word written in uppercase?\" For the word TABLE, it is yes. The second stage is \"processing of sound\" that answer the question \"Does this word rhyme with 'weight'?\" For the word crate, it is yes. The third stage is \"processing of classification\" that answer the question \"Is the word a kind of fish?\" For the word shark, it is yes. The fourth grade is \"processing of sentences\" that answer the question \"Does the word fit in the following sentence: 'He met a ___ in the street.' ?\"",

However, if they did the sound processing, 78% of words are remembered. For the processing of classification, it is 93%.  For the processing of the sentences, it is 96%. In other words, you do a more sophisticated process, remember more.",
