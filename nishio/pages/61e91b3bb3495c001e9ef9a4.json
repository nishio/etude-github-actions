The knowledge organized by the KJ method is like a cultivated soil. If you put new seeds in it, the seeds grow very well. If you leave them, those grow up too much, so eventually, you want to organize it again.",

Unlike stationery, knowledge gathers similar knowledge when used. In other words, similar stationery increase more and more. I also want to put that stationery on the shelf. Eventually, I want to re-organize the shelf of stationery.",
