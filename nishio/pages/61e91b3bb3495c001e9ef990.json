Assigning 25 slides to A4 print paper, the size of one slide is roughly the same as the size of one piece of paper. My one-hour lecture has roughly 100 pages of slides, so if I print and cut them, I can do the group organization. In the process, if I have newly come up with, add extra pieces. In opposite, I can exclude pieces that are not suitable for the new lecture.",
