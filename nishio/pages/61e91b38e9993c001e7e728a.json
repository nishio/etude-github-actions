Suppose you read the answer A1 and understand it. So, now you can solve Q1. At this time, can you solve a similar question Q2? If you just remember the specific answer A1, you cannot solve similar problem Q2. A1 is a piece of concrete information and not abstracted yet. Suppose you learned some more similar problems, and you discovered patterns in how to solve those questions. After that, you can solve the problem Q2.",
