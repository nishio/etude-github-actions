You can also discover new things by repeating the cycle of changing and combining existing elements at random and verifying whether it works or not. Life was born about 4 billion years ago and it repeated a verification of random change and \"whether it can function - whether it can make offspring\" to create a variety of new forms of creatures. Even without intelligence it is possible to create new things. However, an enormous number of trial and error is necessary.",
