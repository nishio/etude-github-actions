According to him, to measure is important. First of all, we estimate the time. We may make a mistake, but there is nothing to worry. Then we run the task, measure the actual time, observe the gap between the estimate and the actual time, learn from them. The basic idea is the same as estimating the size of the task by the number of Pomodoro, and the difference in TaskChute we use the 1-minute unit.",
