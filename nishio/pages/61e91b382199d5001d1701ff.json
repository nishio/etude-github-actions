First, if you classify pieces according to existing classification criteria, the structure obtained by the KJ method is the same as the existing structure. Suppose you have pictures of various kinds of flowers. You classify them according to existing biological classification criteria. For example, an apple, a rose and a cherry-blossom are all \"Rosaceae.\" You make a nameplate \"Rosaceae\" for the group. ",
