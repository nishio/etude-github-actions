Also, in order to do something together, it is important to be able to trust the other person, and having a common friend is effective for this purpose. Combined with the fact that relationships outside the community are important for acquiring new information, a network structure in which small, tight-knit communities are connected through individuals belonging to both is preferable (Figure-1).",

It is quite conceivable that an approach could be taken to use these studies as a reference to independently explain solution jumps due to \"non-convex→convex shape changes\" in a destructive innovation framework.",
