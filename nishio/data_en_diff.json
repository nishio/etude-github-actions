We can prevent people from creating multiple accounts and watering down their opinions by authenticating them with their own numbers, and we can exempt them from the [Public Offices Election Law] by making it a vote for an issue rather than a candidate, thereby opening up voting to minors. Then, when the election for public office approaches, the approval or disapproval of each issue for each generation will be made visible. As a meta-mechanism, it is up to the individual people to decide \"how much weight to give to the opinions of the visible minors in voting.
