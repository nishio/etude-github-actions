This was a pioneering example of a national ordinance regulating urban development, and it was also an unprecedented case in which \"beauty\" was stipulated in a statute. The design guidelines (design code) of the \"Principles of Beauty\" refer to the ideas in \"A Vision of Britain's Future: Reflections on Architecture\" by Charles III, then Crown Prince of Wales, who was concerned that the once beautiful historical buildings of England were being demolished one after another. The \"Ten Principles of Architecture\" referred to in this book are considered as a hint for thinking, because they have a common universality for people living in cities, transcending country and time.",
