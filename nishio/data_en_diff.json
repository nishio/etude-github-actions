          "text": ">Taiwan's judicial and political system also stands out for its adaptability in comprehensively resolving longstanding social conflicts: in 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that the government must pass a law legalizing same-sex marriage within two years. After a referendum on a simple proposal to allow same-sex marriage was rejected in 2018, the government found creative ways to serve the interests of people from all walks of life. Many opponents of same-sex marriage were concerned that families opposed to same-sex marriage would be forced to participate because of the tradition of large families being bound together by marriage. On the other hand, most young people who wanted to take advantage of this new provision had a more individualistic, partner-centered vision of marriage and had no desire to bring families together, so the government passed the same-sex marriage legalization bill with a provision excluding relatives from the same-sex marriage process. The government passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage by excluding relatives from the process.",
