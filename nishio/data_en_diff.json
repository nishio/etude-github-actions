In the following process, we selected works in which the intent of the artist's creation was clearly evident. In this respect, the Japanese artists whose works had been described by their creators in the first category had an advantage. For example, I also appreciated the excellent commentary on Yasukazu Nishio's work. I have long believed that an artist must be able to present his or her work not only visually, but also verbally. However, I evaluated the works of Minoru Sugiyama, Fumitake Suzuki, and Yuta Onoda based on the power of their visuals, even without such ability. This is not consistent with my argument. I am at a loss.",

However, on August 31, 2014, the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress decided that candidates for Administrator must have the support of a majority of the Nomination Committee and that the number of candidates would be limited to two to three. Subsequently, Hong Kong pro-democracy groups such as Gakumin Sichao mobilized students to begin boycotting classes as part of a policy of effectively eliminating the candidacy of anyone who does not align with the wishes of the central government because the majority of the Nomination Committee is made up of pro-China groups.",

It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like \"decrease the padding on the sidebar by half\" because I'm too lazy to find it. I \"Accept All\" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.",

In his book, \"In the Swarm,\" he argues that the seemingly enormous voice of the Internet masses is transient and unable to generate unified will or sustained power. The online \"swarm\" does not have the same [purposeful will-formation] as the traditional public sphere, but only instantaneous reactions (\"schutzstorms\") that generate personal attacks and fail to change the power structure. In other words, the harsh view is that the Internet is no longer a platform for meaningful dialogue, let alone consensus building, and that what emerges is nothing more than pseudo-noise, or pseudo-consensus. Han's point is somewhat pessimistic, but at least it illustrates the danger that the traditional deliberative democratic process does not work in the digital space, and that shortcuts such as the number of \"likes\" and trends are taken as indicators that represent public opinion. There, [quantified support] is misinterpreted as instant consensus, which is an illusion if it is not backed by deep deliberation and [mutual understanding].",

In this way, AI can analyze a large number of opinions and extract \"[latent consensus],\" thereby revealing common ground that was previously invisible. In a sense, Polis is designed to \"[gamify consensus],\" to focus people's attention on points of agreement rather than only on points of conflict. This case shows that technology can work not only to create illusory consensus, but also to uncover real (but buried) consensus.",

According to Mouffe, the public good on which everyone can reasonably agree is a myth, and \"consensus-oriented politics\" that aims for such a good often involves the \"elimination of minorities. Rather, in a healthy democracy, it is inevitable and desirable that there be consensus on certain basic values, but that there be constant clashes of opinion on specific policies. Hence, Mouffe warns that an excessive inclination toward the \"politics of consensus\" leads people to political apathy or boredom and diminishes democratic participation. This is the position of [agonism] ([controversialism]), presented as a critique of the Habermasian model of deliberative democracy, which emphasizes the importance of institutionalizing \"[constructive disagreement]\" as opposed to the [illusion of consensus].",

In the 20th century, however, the political phenomena of mass society ([totalitarianism], [fascism], etc.) made it clear that appeals to reason alone were not enough to sway politics. In her analysis of the rise of totalitarianism, [Hannah Arendt.] also points out that the emotional state of the masses, such as \"[solitude]\" and \"[anxiety],\" became the ground for [blind faith in ideology]. She emphasized the ability to use imagination and empathy and to \"think from the standpoint of [others]\" in political decisions ([extended thinking], the political exercise of [sensus communis]), which can also be said to be a matter of [emotional intelligence] in a broader sense.",

          "text": "Contemporary political philosopher [Martha Nussbaum] argues that \"[feelings of] love and solidarity\" as well as rational institutional design are essential to maintaining a liberal society. In Nussbaum's book \"[Emotions in Politics: Why Love is Necessary for Justice]\" (2013), he explains the need to foster feelings of patriotism and empathy, which make people want to respect each other's basic human rights, in order to support abstract principles such as freedom and equality. This is an idea that is also in line with the \"civil religion\" advocated by the 18th century philosopher [Rousseau] and the \"association\" (\"spirit of association\") pointed out by [Tocqueville], and it is an assertion that people will not make sacrifices for the common good simply by having laws and a constitution, and that [emotional bonds] are necessary. This is the claim. Not only Nussbaum, but political scientists argue that \"[civic passion]\" is important for democratic stability.

Negative emotions such as fear of immigrants and anger toward elites were the main driving force. Social media have also served as a platform for spreading and amplifying feelings of anger and disgust, and many argue that they have become a breeding ground for \"populism\" that has deepened divisions.

In this kind of \"[feeling and participating]\" public sphere, not only rational discussion but also \"empathy for the story\" and \"imagination for the pain of the people involved\" contribute to the formation of public opinion.

Zubov likens surveillance capitalism to \"[a] coup from above,\" criticizing it as a system in which people's preferences and emotions are manipulated without their knowledge. For example, in the [Cambridge Analytica case], a psychological profile was created from Facebook \"Like! data to create psychological profiles using AI and deliver political advertisements that would target individual voters' anxieties and desires in an attempt to change their voting behavior. The scandal made a huge impact by showing that data and AI can be used to precisely deliver messages that appeal to people's emotions. According to Zubov, the goal of surveillance capitalism is not to directly oppress users but to \"[quietly induce them] to behave predictably,\" and in that respect it is more subtle and dangerous than [1984-style totalitarianism]. To counter this less visible form of emotional manipulation, she urges that increased literacy on the part of citizens and transparency through regulation are essential.",

Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio's [* Somatic Marker Hypothesis] showed that emotions play an essential role in [decision-making]. In his research, he reported cases in which patients with damage to the brain regions that process emotions became extremely inefficient at making even everyday choices and were unable to make rational decisions. In other words, even when we think we are making decisions based on \"reason alone,\" there is in fact an \"emotional threshold adjustment,\" without which our judgment is paralyzed. This is also true for political decisions. When voters make decisions on complex policies, it is only natural that they do so based not only on theoretical cost-benefit analysis but also on intuitive feelings of favorable or unfavorable or on feelings of trust. If this is the case, then it is crucial for the democratic process to make group decisions while involving emotions in a healthy manner. The image of a \"rational public sphere\" that separates emotions from the realities of human nature does not fit the realities of human nature, but rather leads us in the direction that institutions should be designed based on the interaction between emotions and reason.",

Stahl has organized several summits in Europe and the Middle East, and in the Rojava Autonomous Region of Kurdistan, he explored the possibility of a stateless democracy by building a domed parliament building with local people. The New World Summit can be described as \"the art of experimenting with democracy itself,\" and is an extremely radical practice in that it presents a model of the public sphere that is not bound by the existing framework of the state. Here, the process (discussion and decision-making) is the work of art, and the participants are at the same time both viewers and creators. This is a remarkable example of how art can extend the imagination of social institutions.",

Avant-garde movements such as Happening and Fluxus broke down the barriers between the viewer and the artwork, opening art to the events of everyday life. [Alain Kaprow] has organized a series of audience-participation \"[happenings]\" since the late 1950s, with the aim of \"[dismantling] the distinction between art and life. Based on this trend, aesthetic theorist [Nicolas Briault] named the participatory and interactive art that emerged in the 1990s \"[relational art] ([the aesthetics of relations]). In relational art, the work of art is not a one-way passage from the artist to the viewer, but the relationships that arise between people become the work of art. Representative artists such as Rirkrit Tiravanija, who served food to the audience at an art museum and turned the table banter itself into a work of art, and Hiroshi Sugimoto, who worked on a project to collaborate in terraced rice fields in a farming village. These are examples of the process becoming a work of art.",

          "text": "There is, however, some sharp criticism of relational art from critic [Claire Bishop]. She pointed out that the Briault theory uncritically regards relationships as \"good,\" and questioned the tendency to praise participatory art as democratic without questioning the quality of the relationships that are created. According to Bishop, \"We assume that a relationship is democratic and good only if a dialogue is established, but shouldn't we examine the quality of the relationship and the power structure that is occurring there? What kind of relationship and for whom?\" . She rather valued participatory works that are fraught with conflict and tension, and appreciated \"[agonistic relationships]\" that do not settle for easy reconciliation. This is an application of [Mouffe's] political thought ([agonism]) to art criticism, and Bishop argues that it is in political art that conflicts and disagreements are made visible and have social significance. For example, the \"Vote In/Vote Out\" project by the Spanish collective PSJM simultaneously aroused trust in and anger toward democracy, as participants voted in a mock election that was later exposed as being rigged. This was intended to create an uncomfortable experience for the participants, but also, therefore, to develop in them a critical awareness of the political system (precisely the art of \"learning from disagreement\" rather than \"comfortable consensus\"). Bishop argued that such \"[* the] violence of participatory art\" should also be noted, and that mere simulations of harmonious communities would not lead to social change.",

Beuys declared, \"[Every human being is an artist],\" and aimed to creatively transform society as a whole by using it as sculptural material. In his signature project, \"[* 7000 Oaks],\" he planted 7000 oak trees in the city of Kassel with citizen volunteers at the Documenta exhibition in 1982, adding a 1.2 meter high basalt stone pillar to each tree. This was an example of environmental art as well as an example of the urban greening movement itself presented as art through [citizen participation]. Beuys believed that \"in order to change the gigantic form of society, we must use not only pictures and sculptures, but also human social activities in general as materials,\" and was actually involved in the formation of a political organization (Green Party) and the establishment of a free school. He stated that \"true [Gesamtkunstwerk] is only possible in the context of society as a whole, and we will never reach the ideal democracy as long as no one is able to participate. These words would embody precisely the ideology that regards the democratic process as a work of art. Beuys' ideological legacy has had a profound influence on subsequent participatory and community art. In fact, \"7000 Oaks\" visualizes the way street trees grew and lined up over a period of five years, symbolizing social sculpture in which art takes time to remake the social environment.",
