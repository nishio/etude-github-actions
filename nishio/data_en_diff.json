          "text": "> The argument proffered in this paper is that use of enterprise social networking technologies can increase the accuracy of people’s metaknowledge (knowledge of \"who knows what\" and \"who knows whom\") at work. The results of a quasi-natural field experiment in which only one of two matched-sample groups within a large financial services firm was given access to the enterprise social networking technology for six months revealed that by making people’s communications with specific partners visible to others in the organization, the technology enabled observers to become aware of the communications occurring amongst their coworkers and to make inferences about what and whom those coworkers knew based on the contents of the messages they sent and to whom they were sent. Consequently only individuals in the group that used the social networking technology for six months improved the accuracy of their metaknowledge (a 31% improvement in knowledge of who knows what and an 88% improvement in knowledge of who knows whom). There were no improvements in the other group over the same time period. Based on these findings, how technologically enabled \"ambient awareness\"—awareness of ambient communications occurring amongst others in the organization—can be an important antecedent for knowledge acquisition is discussed.",

          "text": "This paper examines the impact of the recent emergence of the Internet, particularly large-scale language models (LLMs), on \"digital versions of the public squares\" (digital public squares). In the past, online political and social discussions have fostered a \"[public sphere]\" where ordinary users can freely exchange opinions with each other, but there have been many challenges to its quality and health. And while new technologies such as dialogue support, content coordination, and user authentication through LLMs can create a more inclusive and constructive online public space, they also risk deepening divisions. This paper summarizes the possibilities and risks of LLM for online dialogue and democratic processes around four application areas ([collective dialogue systems], [bridging systems], [community-driven moderation], and [humanity proof systems]), and suggests future research and policy issues.",

At the workshop, they gave a proposal-oriented lecture on the future digital democracy driven by Japan, focusing on PLURALITY. Afterwards, it was an excellent opportunity to deepen understanding through a question-and-answer session with the participating Diet members. A summary of today's proceedings will be made available immediately after the meeting, with the aim of improving the policy-making process and reducing the administrative workload. #Takuya Hirai #PMT Study Group #audreytang #glenweyl #audreytang #glenweyl",
