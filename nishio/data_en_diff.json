And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that is forced upon you. Whatever lures you into wasting your time must be really good at deceiving you. An example that is familiar to many people is an online argument. When someone argues against you, they are in a sense attacking you. Sometimes the attack is quite overt. Your instinct when you are attacked is to try to defend yourself. But like many instincts, this instinct is not designed for the world today. Paradoxically, it is often better not to protect yourself. Otherwise, these people are literally taking your life. (2)",
