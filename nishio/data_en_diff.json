According to their contents, it was clear that there was a conflict between the search services division and the advertising business division over growth measures that were negative for users (i.e., measures that would damage the search experience). These internal communications suggest that intentionally lowering the quality of search results does not result in a loss of users or a decrease in revenue, and it has been confirmed that there was an internal tug-of-war between those who wanted to provide users with high-quality results and those who wanted to prioritize revenue maximization. In fact, the publicly disclosed e-mail stated that \"Google can maintain revenue even if search results deteriorate,\" indicating that the executives were aware that an increase in search queries would lead to an increase in revenue (the more times users search again and again, the more opportunities they have to be exposed to advertisements).",

This decision was made to unify search and advertising. This decision to integrate search and advertising is seen by watchers as a shift from \"user-first\" to \"revenue-first. In fact, in the DOJ lawsuit, the judge in charge of the case focused on the fact that Google had been gradually raising the price of search ads while limiting search query report information for advertisers and otherwise lowering quality, which he found to be evidence of the company's illegal attempts to maintain its monopoly. While these actions directly relate to the quality of search results for users, they also confirm the company's prioritization of revenue over the overall quality of its products.",

It stores information such as full texts and summaries of past conversations and the user's personality (preferences and personalities) in a \"memory bank,\" and retrieves and refers to related memories during a dialogue. The feature is dynamic memory updating based on [Ebbinghaus' forgetting curve] theory, which increases or decreases the intensity of memory according to the passage of time and the degree of importance. Specifically, each memory item is assigned a \"strength based on frequency of use,\" and memories that are not referenced for a long period of time decay in strength and are forgotten like humans, while memories that are recalled even once are strengthened and their lifespan is prolonged.",

It consists of (1) a long-term memory that stores the entire past session, (2) a short-term memory of the current session, (3) dynamic personality models of users and agents themselves, and (4) a response generation module. After each session, important events are stored in the long-term memory as summary entries, and new user information is updated in the personality profile. In addition, topic-based memory retrieval is introduced during retrieval to effectively extract past episodes that are relevant to the topic. For example, in a dialogue about hobbies, noise is reduced by narrowing the search to memories in the hobby category. LD-Agent can be applied independently of model size and dialogue domain, and experiments have shown that it can be used on multiple datasets, including PersonaChat-derived Experiments have shown its versatility and effectiveness on multiple datasets, including multi-session dialogues derived from PersonaChat.",
