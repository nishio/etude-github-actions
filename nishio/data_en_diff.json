          "text": "\t[* Audrey]: We coined the term \"[Plurality]\". Instead of calling it \"inclusive diversity\" or \"[digital democracy]\". Because these terms already have a coloring in certain areas. For example, if you say \"digital democracy\" for Plurality, people think of electronic voting machines, even though Plurality can be applied in the workplace. When you say \"inclusive diversity,\" people immediately think of things like gender and race. That, of course, is also an important part of difference, but it is not the primary focus of this highly coordinated technology.",
