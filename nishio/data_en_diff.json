          "text": "In this paper, they conclude that it is better to review at the time of about one-tenth of the interval to the test when the interval to the test is more than 1 day. However, we can not always study on the optimal interval. If you stick to optimal intervals, you feel failed and decrease motivation. The correct answer ratio goes down gently after the peak. So even if you forgot to review after the optimal one-month interval and you reviewed it after 6 months, the results of the test are better than when you review it in a day. I recommend you not to worry too much about the optimal interval.",

There is a theory that it is because it has a large tail featuring that it functions as a [signal] to appeal that \"I have a high ability to gather food\" because much nutrition is needed to make a big tail. When the female chooses male, we can not directly observe the ability to collect food. So they decide it by tail feathers which are easy to observe. It is called \"[handicap theory].\"",

I write this for my own sake. First of all, comparing these two, I think that Mr. C has been talked about more than Mr. D. In fact, I heard about Mr. C first. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to spend some quality time with Mr. D before Mr. C. I thought it was the best thing I could do. I thought it was great. It's nice to be able to communicate via Slack. I might be able to give up my computer and live my dream life on a smartphone.",

But they also charge a lot, saying \"We'll pay you for the work you've done. Until the payment is received, they also share something like \"I haven't received the money, so I'm going to sleep. I can't sleep because they always say, \"If you don't reply within 30 minutes after we contact you, I'll go to bed. It's hard.",

I immediately thought, \"This is it. The sound of the zither was broken up one by one. But when I listened to it from a distance like this, it sounded like a series of notes. I realized that the cracks of the previous note covered the next note, filling the space between the two notes. This gave me a glimpse of the principle of the continuity of the discontinuity. But it was not yet an immediate hypothesis. I don't remember how long I kept it there, but it must have been lying dormant. One day, the film suddenly became interesting again. I was able to recognize an analogy between this and the previous sequence. This led to the hypothesis that words have the property of generating rhetorical afterimages.

The afterimage of the plurals was extended to the verb and brought out the third clause. I gave this afterimage the name \"rhetorical afterimage. When we recognize rhetorical afterimages, we find that we can recognize their effects in various places, not only in the examples shown in the previous paragraphs. For example, there are times when the meaning of a sentence in a foreign language, which is difficult even for a dictionary expert, is not clear no matter how much you check the meaning of the word. In such cases, if a native speaker of the language reads the text aloud at a natural speed, the meaning can be understood without any other explanation (cid:8270). Afterimages disappear in an instant, so it is difficult for them to work in close reading and decoding. If a foreign language is read too carefully or too slowly, it can be said that the afterimages that naturally work are killed, making it more difficult to understand than it actually is. The afterimage effect is also a strong point of the Japanese language. Consider the haiku by Basho, \"The sound of water in an old pond and frogs jumping in... Haiku is a form of poetry that makes full use of rhetorical afterimages without being conscious of them.",

I have never been taught the method of analogy, so I can say that it was a serendipitous experience for me. It seems that the lingering effects of images, echoes, and reverberations of words are obtained through casual reading. If we read only books in narrowly specialized fields, our minds become inactive and uncreative. It seems to lean toward mimicry. On the other hand, unexpected ideas and hints are often hidden in books that we skim lightly, which is the benefit of binge reading. The reason for the appearance of specialized idiots is that they have been in the same kind of place, and if they get out of the place and swim in the ocean, they will be able to find abundant blessings. The good thing about binge reading is that it is fast. Reading for expertise or knowledge tends to lead to unintentionally slow reading. Words, as I mentioned earlier, have afterimages. Since it is a temporal phenomenon, careful reading makes it difficult to read with the help of afterimages. In this respect, careful readers are not as good as discourse. The spoken word has a certain speed. It is interesting to note that intelligent speakers are said to have a faster tempo, and while the emotional effect of slow speech is valuable, it is difficult to think of new ideas or to be original. Written words are generally slower paced than spoken words. It is worth noting that the tempo of the written word is generally slower than the tempo of the spoken word, and that reading the written word is faster than the tempo of the spoken word. The reader has the advantage over the author in terms of the tempo of the words. It is unwise to read in a namelike manner just because it is difficult. In fact, there are many who recommend reading the text in a namelike manner, but this should be considered carefully.",

Language maps [symbols] to these \"concepts\" and is used to consciously manipulate the \"concepts. Consciously manipulating this concept, he believes, is \"[consider]. What does it mean to model the world? It means observing the world, finding common [patterns] that appear repeatedly, and selecting only the useful ones to model. Design patterns were created by observing many programs and naming the structures that appeared repeatedly. This is exactly what creating a \"language\" is. By creating a language, humans can think, \"Let's make a mediator pattern here,\" instead of thinking, \"Instead of lots of things interacting with each other, let's make a design that feels like it creates something that mediates the interaction,\" which reduces the effort of thinking. This is the benefit of mapping symbols to concepts.",

This final ground (criterion) of correctness is called [authority] ([authority]). Authority itself, of course, cannot be proved ([justification]).
