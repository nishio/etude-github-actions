He mentioned fandom as a form of association in our time, and said that fandom, which is often exclusive, should be created with openness. He also defined politics as the art of plurality and the art of cooperation among mutually different and equal people, and called for its restoration.

He expressed hope that simple democracy tends to become unconstrained populism and that Deliberative Democracy (Deliberative Democracy) and Democratic Experimentalism (Democratic Experimentalism) will become the driving force. In Japan today, lawsuits, rather than politics, have become an effective platform for social change. The presentation posed the following questions.",

He stated that he came across Radical Markets while feeling troubled by the current capitalist system but feeling that existing alternatives were insufficient. Noting that economics has not adequately addressed market failures and economic disparities, he mentioned the keyword \"Alone\" proposed by Glenn Weyl and said that he recognized the challenge of economics' overemphasis on personal rationality and decision-making. He introduced the idea of economics contributing to plurality through a mechanism (e.g., the TTC algorithm) and a collective decision-making mechanism that does not rely on the number of votes (boat count). In particular, he praised the Majority Judgment mechanism for its superiority in revealing the distribution of ratings for each candidate and its potential to make collective decision-making visible.",

Choice offers a variety of features, including boat-matching**, gamification with quizzes, policy comparisons (80+ topics), tracking of key KPIs, and guides on how to vote, and reported that over 1 million people, primarily teens to early 40s, are using it.

The people who understand don't know what the people who don't understand don't understand, so it is necessary to teach them first. Of course, the person who teaches them afterwards also contributes to society.",

At the workshop, they gave a proposal-oriented lecture on the future digital democracy driven by Japan, focusing on PLURALITY. Afterwards, it was an excellent opportunity to deepen understanding through a question-and-answer session with the participating Diet members. A summary of today's proceedings will be made available immediately after the meeting, with the aim of improving the policy-making process and reducing the administrative workload. #Takuya Hirai #PMT Study Group #audreytang #glenweyl #audreytang #glenweyl",
